## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Individuals 12 years of age and older

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for individuals 12 years of age and older regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age)

Comirnaty JN.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Severely immunocompromised individuals

Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations.

The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established.

## Elderly population

No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65 years of age and older.

## Method of administration

Comirnaty JN.1 dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute prior to use.

The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Single dose vials

Single dose vials of Comirnaty JN.1 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine.

- Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of Comirnaty JN.1.
- Discard vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

## Multidose vials

Multidose vials of Comirnaty JN.1 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead-volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:

- Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

## Pre-filled syringes

- Each single dose pre-filled syringe of Comirnaty JN.1 contains 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- Attach a needle appropriate for intramuscular injection and administer the entire volume.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty JN.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine.

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In individuals 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine.

Different injectable vaccines should be administered at different injection sites.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty JN.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection with other vaccines has not been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy.

However, there are limited clinical study data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Comirnaty in pregnant participants. A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding.

However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty JN.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty JN.1 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (&gt; 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 30%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (&gt; 10%).

## Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).

## Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.

At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.

The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses

The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older.

A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (&gt; 70%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 20%), and arthralgia (&gt; 10%).

In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults &gt; 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants &gt; 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 10%).

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of 6.3 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), and muscle pain (&gt; 10%).

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (fourth dose)

In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and older were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 40%), muscle pain (&gt; 20%), chills (&gt; 10%), and joint pain (&gt; 10%).

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Safety with concomitant vaccine administration

## Concomitant administration with seasonal influenza vaccine

In Study 8, a Phase 3 study, participants 18 through 64 years of age who received Comirnaty coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), quadrivalent followed 1 month later by placebo, were compared to participants who received an inactivated influenza vaccine with placebo followed 1 month later by Comirnaty alone (n = 553 to 564 participants in each group).

## Concomitant administration with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine

In Study 11 (B7471026), a Phase 3 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received a booster dose of Comirnaty coadministered with 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPNC) (n = 187) were compared to participants who received Comirnaty alone (n = 185).

## Concomitant administration with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine or with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine

In Study 12 (C5481001), a Phase 1/2 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and RSV vaccine coadministered in one arm plus high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) (n = 158) or placebo (n = 157) in the opposite arm were compared to participants who received the individual vaccines given with placebo.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 3.

- a. Protocol-specified timing for blood sample collection.
- b. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- c. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- d. GMRs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS Means for the assay and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed assay results using a linear regression model with baseline log-transformed neutralising titres, postbaseline infection status, and vaccine group as covariates.
- e. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 t o 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

Analyses of 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 4).

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 4).

The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 5).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.

- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the pre-vaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/wild-type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 to 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarised in Table 11.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed.

The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 12. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological

## Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine

Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series (N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively.

Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study (EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine primary series, pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).

## Immunogenicity in participants &gt; 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg)

In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants &gt; 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immunogenicity in participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg)

In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 14.

## Immunogenicity in pregnant participants and infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses with Comirnaty

Study 9 was a Phase 2/3 multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study that enrolled pregnant participants 18 years of age and older to receive 2 doses of Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Pregnant participants received Dose 1 of Comirnaty at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and the majority (90.2%) received the second dose 19 to 23 days after Dose 1.

Descriptive immunogenicity analysis was performed in pregnant participants receiving Comirnaty in Study 9 compared to a comparator subset of nonpregnant participants from Study 2 evaluating the ratio of the neutralising GMT (GMR) 1 month after Dose 2. The evaluable immunogenicity population who received Comirnaty in the pregnant participants group in Study 9 (n = 111) and in nonpregnant participants in Study 2 (n = 114) had a median age of 30 years (range 18 to 44 years of age) and comprised of 37.8% vs 3.5% with a positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, respectively.

Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the observed SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was lower in the pregnant participants (Study 9) when compared to nonpregnant female participants (Study 2) (the ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90).

Among participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the model-adjusted GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was similar in the pregnant participants when compared to nonpregnant female participants (the model-adjusted ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.30). The model-adjusted GMT and GMR were calculated based on a regression model adjusting for age and baseline neutralizing titres.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age)

Comirnaty JN.1 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 3 doses. It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level.

## Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID-19 primary course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age.

For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Severely immunocompromised individuals

Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4).

## Interchangeability

The Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose primary course may consist of any previous or current Comirnaty vaccine but not exceeding the total number of doses required as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once.

The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been established.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Comirnaty JN.1 concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).

## Orange cap (10-dose vial) or maroon cap (10-dose vial)

After dilution, vials with an orange cap or maroon cap of Comirnaty JN.1 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead-volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:

- Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine.
- If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL , discard the vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

## Yellow cap (3-dose vial)

After dilution, vials with a yellow cap of Comirnaty JN.1 contain 3 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Standard syringes and needles can be used to extract 3 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:

- Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL , discard the vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 to 4 years of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. In individuals 5 years of age and older the preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.

For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty JN.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty JN.1 with other vaccines has not been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy.

However, there are limited clinical study data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Comirnaty in pregnant participants. A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding.

However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty JN.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty JN.1 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

## Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after 3 doses

In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 176 infants (1 458 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 718 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age.

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 310 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion.

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 6 months to 5 years of age who received Comirnaty (Bivalent BA.4-5) as a booster dose in Study 6 compared to a subset of participants from Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response based on GMR and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 3).

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 4.

Analyses of 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 5).

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 5).

The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 6).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the pre-vaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Comirnaty

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 7.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 9) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 10. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 11.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarised in Table 12.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age

The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 6 months to 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomisation ratio) who received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron variant of SARS -CoV -2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 17 June 2022).

The vaccine efficacy results after Dose 3 in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are presented in Table 13.

Severe COVID-19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months to 23 months of age, severe COVID-19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo).

Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.

SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA\\_WA1/2020).

The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The pre-specified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for both age groups (Table 14).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; N-binding = SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-binding; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Participants who had no serological or virological evidence [(up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood sample collection)] of past SARS-CoV-2 infection [(i.e. N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1, Dose 3 (Study 3) and 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3), SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 (Study 3) study visits, and negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood collection)] and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the analysis.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given dose/sampling time point for GMTs and number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both baseline and the given dose/sampling time point for seroresponse rates.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- d. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on GMR is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR ratio is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- e. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralisation Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA\\_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralisation is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised.
- f. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given dose/sampling time point.
- g. Exact 2-sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- h. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age).
- i. 2-sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- j. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions is greater than -10.0% provided that the immunobridging criteria based on GMR were met.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

- Attach a needle appropriate for intramuscular injection and administer the entire volume.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty KP.2 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine.

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In individuals 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine.

Different injectable vaccines should be administered at different injection sites.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty KP.2 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection with other vaccines has not been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during pregnancy.

However, there are limited clinical study data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Comirnaty in pregnant participants. A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during breast-feeding.

However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty KP.2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty KP.2 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (&gt; 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 30%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (&gt; 10%).

## Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).

## Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.

At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.

The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been foll owed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses

The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older.

A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (&gt; 70%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 20%), and arthralgia (&gt; 10%).

In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults &gt; 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants &gt; 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 10%).

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of 6.3 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), and muscle pain (&gt; 10%).

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (fourth dose)

In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 40%), muscle pain (&gt; 20%), chills (&gt; 10%), and joint pain (&gt; 10%).

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Safety with concomitant vaccine administration

## Concomitant administration with seasonal influenza vaccine

In Study 8, a Phase 3 study, participants 18 through 64 years of age who received Comirnaty coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), quadrivalent followed 1 month later by placebo, were compared to participants who received an inactivated influenza vaccine with placebo followed 1 month later by Comirnaty alone (n = 553 to 564 participants in each group).

## Concomitant administration with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine

In Study 11 (B7471026), a Phase 3 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received a booster dose of Comirnaty coadministered with 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPNC) (n = 187) were compared to participants who received Comirnaty alone (n = 185).

Concomitant administration with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine or with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine

In Study 12 (C5481001), a Phase 1/2 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and RSV vaccine coadministered in one arm plus high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) (n = 158) or placebo (n = 157) in the opposite arm were compared to participants who received the individual vaccines given with placebo.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 3.

- a. Protocol-specified timing for blood sample collection.
- b. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- c. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- d. GMRs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS Means for the assay and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed assay results using a linear regression model with baseline log-transformed neutralising titres, postbaseline infection status, and vaccine group as covariates.
- e. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 t o 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

Analyses of 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 4).

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 4).

The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 5).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the pre-vaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/wild-type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

## Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose

Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 to 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarised in Table 11.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed.

The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 12. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological

## Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine

Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series (N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively.

Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study (EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine primary series, pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).

## Immunogenicity in participants &gt; 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg)

In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants &gt; 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immunogenicity in participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg)

In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 14.

## Immunogenicity in pregnant participants and infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses with Comirnaty

Study 9 was a Phase 2/3 multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study that enrolled pregnant participants 18 years of age and older to receive 2 doses of Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Pregnant participants received Dose 1 of Comirnaty at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and the majority (90.2%) received the second dose 19 to 23 days after Dose 1.

Descriptive immunogenicity analysis was performed in pregnant participants receiving Comirnaty in Study 9 compared to a comparator subset of nonpregnant participants from Study 2 evaluating the ratio of the neutralising GMT (GMR) 1 month after Dose 2. The evaluable immunogenicity population who received Comirnaty in the pregnant participants group in Study 9 (n = 111) and in nonpregnant participants in Study 2 (n = 114) had a median age of 30 years (range 18 to 44 years of age) and comprised of 37.8% vs 3.5% with a positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, respectively.

Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the observed SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was lower in the pregnant participants (Study 9) when compared to nonpregnant female participants (Study 2) (the ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90).

Among participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the model-adjusted GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was similar in the pregnant participants when compared to nonpregnant female participants (the model-adjusted ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.30). The model-adjusted GMT and GMR were calculated based on a regression model adjusting for age and baseline neutralizing titres.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

Comirnaty KP.2 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age.

For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty KP.2 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years

Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4).

## Interchangeability

The Comirnaty KP.2 3 micrograms/dose primary course may consist of any previous or current Comirnaty vaccine but not exceeding the total number of doses required as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once.

The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been established.

## Paediatric population

There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations.

The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established.

## Method of administration

Comirnaty KP.2 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).

After dilution, vials with a yellow cap of Comirnaty KP.2 contain 3 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Standard syringes and needles can be used to extract 3 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:

- Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL , discard the vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle.

Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty KP.2 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty KP.2 with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Comirnaty KP.2 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.

For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for those formulations.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty KP.2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty KP.2 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after 3 doses

In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 176 infants (1 458 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 718 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023, 720 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 3-dose primary course (483 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 237 placebo) have been followed for a median of 1.7 months after the third dose.

The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course dose included irritability (&gt; 60%), drowsiness (&gt; 40%), decreased appetite (&gt; 30%), tenderness at the injection site (&gt; 20%), injection site redness and fever (&gt; 10%).

## Children 2 to 4 years of age - after 3 doses

In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 3 541 children (2 368 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 1 173 placebo) were 2 to 4 years of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023, 1 268 children 2 to 4 years of age who received a 3-dose primary course (863 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 405 placebo) have been followed a median of 2.2 months after the third dose.

The most frequent adverse reactions in children 2 to 4 years of age that received any primary course dose included pain at injection site and fatigue (&gt; 40%), injection site redness and fever (&gt; 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills and diarrhoea (&gt; 10%).

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 30%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (&gt; 10%).

## Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).

## Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.

At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.

The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 310 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion.

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 6 months to 5 years of age who received Comirnaty (Bivalent BA.4-5) as a booster dose in Study 6 compared to a subset of participants from Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response based on GMR and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LSMeans = least square means; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before the first dose of study vaccination). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the LSMeans and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed assay results using a linear regression model with baseline log-transformed neutralis ing titres, postbaseline infection status, age group (for ≥ 6 Months to &lt; 5 Years only) and vaccine group as covariates. Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LSMeans for the assay and the corresponding CIs based on the same regression model as stated above.
- d. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 3.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the prevaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarised in Table 11.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age

The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 6 months to 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomisation ratio) who received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron variant of SARS -CoV -2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 17 June 2022).

The vaccine efficacy results after Dose 3 in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are presented in Table 12.

Severe COVID-19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months to 23 months of age, severe COVID-19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo).

Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.

SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA\\_WA1/2020).

The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The pre-specified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for both age groups (Table 13).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; N-binding = SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-binding; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Participants who had no serological or virological evidence [(up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood sample collection)] of past SARS-CoV-2 infection [(i.e. N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1, Dose 3 (Study 3) and 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3), SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 (Study 3) study visits, and negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood collection)] and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the analysis.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given dose/sampling time point for GMTs and number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both baseline and the given dose/sampling time point for seroresponse rates.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- d. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on GMR is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR ratio is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- e. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralisation Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA\\_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralisation is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised.
- f. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given dose/sampling time point.
- g. Exact 2-sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- h. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age).
- i. 2-sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- j. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions is greater than -10.0% provided that the immunobridging criteria based on GMR were met.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

## Single dose vials

Single dose vials of Comirnaty LP.8.1 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine.

- Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of Comirnaty LP.8.1.
- Discard vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

## Multidose vials

Multidose vials of Comirnaty LP.8.1 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead-volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:

- Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.
- Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

## Pre-filled syringes

- Each single dose pre-filled syringe of Comirnaty LP.8.1 contains 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine.
- Attach a needle appropriate for intramuscular injection and administer the entire volume.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty LP.8.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine.

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

In individuals 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In individuals 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be administered concomitantly with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine.

Different injectable vaccines should be administered at different injection sites.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty LP.8.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during pregnancy.

However, there are limited clinical study data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Comirnaty in pregnant participants. A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during breast-feeding.

However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty LP.8.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty LP.8.1 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

## Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses

In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills, and diarrhoea (&gt; 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 30%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (&gt; 10%).

## Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).

## Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.

At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.

The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been foll owed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses

The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older.

A subset of 325 adults 18 to ≤ 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (&gt; 70%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 20%), and arthralgia (&gt; 10%).

In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults &gt; 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants &gt; 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 10%).

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of 6.3 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 40%), headache (&gt; 20%), and muscle pain (&gt; 10%).

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (fourth dose)

In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 had a median follow-up time of at least 1.5 months.

The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 40%), muscle pain (&gt; 20%), chills (&gt; 10%), and joint pain (&gt; 10%).

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Safety with concomitant vaccine administration

## Concomitant administration with seasonal influenza vaccine

In Study 8, a Phase 3 study, participants 18 through 64 years of age who received Comirnaty coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), quadrivalent followed 1 month later by placebo, were compared to participants who received an inactivated influenza vaccine with placebo followed 1 month later by Comirnaty alone (n = 553 to 564 participants in each group).

## Concomitant administration with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine

In Study 11 (B7471026), a Phase 3 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received a booster dose of Comirnaty coadministered with 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPNC) (n = 187) were compared to participants who received Comirnaty alone (n = 185).

## Concomitant administration with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine or with an unadjuvanted recombinant protein RSV vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine

In Study 12 (C5481001), a Phase 1/2 study, participants 65 years of age and older who received Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and RSV vaccine coadministered in one arm plus high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) (n = 158) or placebo (n = 157) in the opposite arm were compared to participants who received the individual vaccines given with placebo.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 3.

Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 55 years of age, and 286 participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 t o 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

Analyses of 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 4).

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 4).

The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti-Omicron BA.4-5 SARS-CoV-2 and reference strains pre-vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 5).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the pre-vaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/wild-type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

## Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose

Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 to 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarised in Table 11.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed.

The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 12. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological

evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarised in Table 13.

## Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine

Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2-dose series (N = 51, mean age 54±17), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48±14), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50±18) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR-fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively.

Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study (EudraCT 2021-002175-19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine primary series, pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising antibody NT50 GMR-fold change increased 21.6-fold with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95).

## Immunogenicity in participants &gt; 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg)

In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants &gt; 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 8.

## Immunogenicity in pregnant participants and infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses with Comirnaty

Study 9 was a Phase 2/3 multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study that enrolled pregnant participants 18 years of age and older to receive 2 doses of Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Pregnant participants received Dose 1 of Comirnaty at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and the majority (90.2%) received the second dose 19 to 23 days after Dose 1.

Descriptive immunogenicity analysis was performed in pregnant participants receiving Comirnaty in Study 9 compared to a comparator subset of nonpregnant participants from Study 2 evaluating the ratio of the neutralising GMT (GMR) 1 month after Dose 2. The evaluable immunogenicity population who received Comirnaty in the pregnant participants group in Study 9 (n = 111) and in nonpregnant participants in Study 2 (n = 114) had a median age of 30 years (range 18 to 44 years of age) and comprised of 37.8% vs 3.5% with a positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, respectively.

Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the observed SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was lower in the pregnant participants (Study 9) when compared to nonpregnant female participants (Study 2) (the ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90).

Among participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the model-adjusted GMT 1 month after Dose 2 was similar in the pregnant participants when compared to nonpregnant female participants (the model-adjusted ratio of the GMT [GMR] was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.30). The model-adjusted GMT and GMR were calculated based on a regression model adjusting for age and baseline neutralizing titres.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.

Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty.

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed.

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.

Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of protection

The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty LP.8.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Concomitant administration of Comirnaty LP.8.1 with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Comirnaty LP.8.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.

For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for those formulations.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Comirnaty LP.8.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The safety of Comirnaty LP.8.1 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after 3 doses

In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 176 infants (1 458 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 718 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023, 720 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 3-dose primary course (483 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 237 placebo) have been followed for a median of 1.7 months after the third dose.

The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course dose included irritability (&gt; 60%), drowsiness (&gt; 40%), decreased appetite (&gt; 30%), tenderness at the injection site (&gt; 20%), injection site redness and fever (&gt; 10%).

## Children 2 to 4 years of age - after 3 doses

In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 3 541 children (2 368 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 1 173 placebo) were 2 to 4 years of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023, 1 268 children 2 to 4 years of age who received a 3-dose primary course (863 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 405 placebo) have been followed a median of 2.2 months after the third dose.

The most frequent adverse reactions in children 2 to 4 years of age that received any primary course dose included pain at injection site and fatigue (&gt; 40%), injection site redness and fever (&gt; 10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose in the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 50%), headache (&gt; 30%), injection site redness and swelling (≥ 20%), myalgia, chills and diarrhoea (&gt; 10%).

Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 2 408 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5.3 to 19.4 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 28 February 2023 (median follow-up time of 6.4 months).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age after the booster dose were injection site pain (&gt; 60%), fatigue (&gt; 30%), headache (&gt; 20%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (&gt; 10%).

## Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the second dose.

The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).

## Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.

At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.

The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.

The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.

## Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for ≥ 6 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (22 November 2021).

The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).

In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period to the cut-off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for ≥ 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 825 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 11.2 months (range of 6.3 to 20.1 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 10.7 months) based on data up to the cut-off date (3 November 2022). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified.

Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified.

## Special populations

## Infants born to pregnant participants - after 2 doses of Comirnaty

Study C4591015 (Study 9), a Phase 2/3, placebo-controlled study, evaluated a total of 346 pregnant participants who received Comirnaty (n = 173) or placebo (n = 173). Infants (Comirnaty n = 167 or placebo n = 168) were evaluated up to 6 months. No safety concerns were identified that were attributable to maternal vaccination with Comirnaty.

## Immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

In study C4591024 (Study 10), a total of 124 immunocompromised participants 2 years of age and older received Comirnaty (see section 5.1).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Myocarditis and pericarditis

The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).

Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI: 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons.

Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of higher than recommended doses of Comirnaty in clinical trials and post -authorisation experience. In general, adverse events reported with overdoses have been similar to the known adverse reaction profile of Comirnaty.

In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01

## Mechanism of action

The nucleoside modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.

## Efficacy

## Omicron-adapted Comirnaty

Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 310 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion.

Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4-5 and against reference strain among participants 6 months to 5 years of age who received Comirnaty (Bivalent BA.4-5) as a booster dose in Study 6 compared to a subset of participants from Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of anti-Omicron BA.4-5 response based on GMR and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates, and noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response based on GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LSMeans = least square means; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before the first dose of study vaccination). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the LSMeans and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of log-transformed assay results using a linear regression model with baseline log-transformed neutralising titres, postbaseline infection status, age group (for ≥ 6 Months to &lt; 5 Years only) and vaccine group as covariates. Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LSMeans for the assay and the corresponding CIs based on the same regression model as stated above.
- d. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose)

In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively.

The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 elicited generally similar Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralising titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 also elicited similar reference strain-specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 3.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; LS = least square; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline. If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference of LS means and corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed neutralising titres using a linear regression model with terms of baseline neutralising titre (log scale) and vaccine group or age group.
- d. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using a validated 384-well assay platform (original strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.4/BA.5).
- e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.
- f. Superiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 1.
- g. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- h. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both the prevaccination time point and the given sampling time point. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculation.
- i. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given sampling time point.
- j. Exact 2-sided CI, based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- k. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- l. 2-sided CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralising titre category (&lt; median, ≥ median) for the difference in proportions. The median of baseline neutralising titres was calculated based on the pooled data in 2 comparator groups.
- m. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -10%.
- n. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is &gt; -5%.

## Initially approved Comirnaty vaccine

Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).

## Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses

In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine.

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).

At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2 214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person-years in the placebo group.

There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6.

## Efficacy against severe COVID-19

Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19.

As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses

In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of &gt; 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0).

In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).

The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) after 2 doses

Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose-finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.

Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pre-specified hypothesis-driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2).

In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the pre-specified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).

The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10.

## Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose

A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA\\_WA1/2020). Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 to 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarised in Table 11.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity of a 3-dose primary course in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age

The efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 6 months to 4 years of age based on cases confirmed among 873 participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomisation ratio) who received all 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron variant of SARS -CoV -2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cut-off date of 17 June 2022).

The vaccine efficacy results after Dose 3 in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are presented in Table 12.

Severe COVID-19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months to 23 months of age, severe COVID-19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo).

Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut-off date of 29 April 2022.

SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3-dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA\\_WA1/2020).

The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The pre-specified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for both age groups (Table 13).

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre;

LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; N-binding = SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-binding; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Note: Participants who had no serological or virological evidence [(up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood sample collection)] of past SARS-CoV-2 infection [(i.e. N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1, Dose 3 (Study 3) and 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3), SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 (Study 3) study visits, and negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit up to 1 month after Dose 2 (Study 2) or 1 month after Dose 3 (Study 3) blood collection)] and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the analysis.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.

- a. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given dose/sampling time point for GMTs and number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both baseline and the given dose/sampling time point for seroresponse rates.
- b. GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
- c. GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- d. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on GMR is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR ratio is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥ 0.8.
- e. SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralisation Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA\\_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralisation is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised.
- f. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given dose/sampling time point.
- g. Exact 2-sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method.
- h. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age).
- i. 2-sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.
- j. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions is greater than -10.0% provided that the immunobridging criteria based on GMR were met.

## Immunogenicity in immunocompromised participants (adults and children)

Study 10 is a Phase 2b, open-label study (n = 124) that enrolled immunocompromised participants 2 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving immunomodulator therapy or who have undergone solid organ transplant (within the previous 3 months) and are on immunosuppression or who have undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplant at least 6 months prior to enrolment and in immunocompromised participants 18 years of age and older treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), receiving haemodialysis for secondary to end-stage renal disease, or receiving immunomodulator therapy for an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Participants received 4 age-appropriate doses of Comirnaty (3 mcg, 10 mcg, or 30 mcg); the first 2 doses separated by 21 days, with the third dose occurring 28 days after the second dose, followed by a fourth dose, 3 to 6 months after Dose 3.

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after Dose 3 (26 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 56 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 11 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) and 1 month after Dose 4 (16 participants 2 to &lt; 5 years of age, 31 participants 5 to &lt; 12 years of age, 6 participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 4 participants ≥ 18 years of age) in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection demonstrated a vaccine-elicited immune response. GMTs were observed to be substantially higher at 1 month after Dose 3 and further increased at 1 month after Dose 4 and remained high at 6 months after Dose 4 compared to levels observed before study vaccination across age groups and disease subsets.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

## General toxicity

Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on post-natal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection (frozen vials) Adults and adolescents from 12 years COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine

bretovameran

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1
3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty JN.1
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty JN.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty JN.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1

## Comirnaty JN.1 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1
3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty JN.1
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty JN.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty JN.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1

## Comirnaty JN.1 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1

## 1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty JN.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty JN.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty JN.1

## Comirnaty JN.1 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty JN.1 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given

Comirnaty JN.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty JN.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty JN.1, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

bretovameran

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains important information for your child.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## 1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty JN.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty JN.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty JN.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty JN.1

## Comirnaty JN.1 should not be given

- if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child:

- has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past.
- is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty JN.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 5 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If your child is pregnant, tell your child's doctor, nurse or pharmacist before your child receives this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used during pregnancy.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty JN.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty JN.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention.

## 3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given

Comirnaty JN.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your child's upper arm.

Your child will receive 1 injection, regardless whether he/she has received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, he/she should not receive a dose of Comirnaty JN.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty JN.1, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged 5 years to 11 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.

For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those formulations.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention.

## 3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given

If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Comirnaty JN.1 with a maroon cap after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your infant or child is 1 year of age or older, he/she will be given Comirnaty JN.1 with a maroon cap after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh or into a muscle of the upper arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If your child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by COVID-19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses required as primary course). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.

If your child has previously completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has had COVID-19, your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty JN.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level.

If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1.

## Interchangeability

Your child may receive any previous or current Comirnaty vaccine for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than the total number of doses needed as primary course. Your child should only be administered the primary course once.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty JN.1, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains important information for your child.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty JN.1
3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty JN.1
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty JN.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty JN.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to infants and children from 6 months to 4 years of age.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty JN.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty JN.1

## Comirnaty JN.1 should not be given

- if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child:

- has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past.
- is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty JN.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged 5 years to 11 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty JN.1

Tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Comirnaty JN.1 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age.

For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those formulations.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention.

## 3. How Comirnaty JN.1 is given

If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Comirnaty JN.1 with a yellow cap after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your infant or child is 1 year of age or older, he/she will be given Comirnaty JN.1 with a yellow cap after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of the thigh or into a muscle of the upper arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If your child has not completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by COVID-19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses required as primary course). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course.

If your child has previously completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or has had COVID-19, your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty JN.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level.

If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty JN.1.

## Interchangeability

Your child may receive any previous or current Comirnaty vaccine for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than the total number of doses needed as primary course. Your child should only be administered the primary course once.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty JN.1, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

cemivameran

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty KP.2 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty KP.2
3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty KP.2
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty KP.2 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty KP.2 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty KP.2 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty KP.2

## Comirnaty KP.2 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty KP.2 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty KP.2

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given

Comirnaty KP.2 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty KP.2 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty KP.2, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty KP.2 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty KP.2

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given

Comirnaty KP.2 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty KP.2 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty KP.2 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty KP.2
3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty KP.2
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty KP.2 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty KP.2 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty KP.2 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty KP.2

## Comirnaty KP.2 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty KP.2 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty KP.2 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty KP.2

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty KP.2 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given

Comirnaty KP.2 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty KP.2 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty KP.2, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 1. What Comirnaty KP.2 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty KP.2 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty KP.2 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty KP.2 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty KP.2

## Comirnaty KP.2 should not be given

- if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child:

- has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past.
- is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty KP.2 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty KP.2 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty KP.2 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 5 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty KP.2

Tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If your child is pregnant, tell your child's doctor, nurse or pharmacist before your child receives this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used during pregnancy.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty KP.2 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty KP.2 can be used while breast-feeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention.

## 3. How Comirnaty KP.2 is given

Comirnaty KP.2 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your child's upper arm.

Your child will receive 1 injection, regardless whether he/she has received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, he/she should not receive a dose of Comirnaty KP.2 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty KP.2.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty KP.2, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection (frozen vials) Adults and adolescents from 12 years COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine

mRNA encoding LP.8.1

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Comirnaty LP.8.1 is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty LP.8.1
3. How Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Comirnaty LP.8.1
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Comirnaty LP.8.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty LP.8.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty LP.8.1

## Comirnaty LP.8.1 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty LP.8.1

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty LP.8.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 1. What Comirnaty LP.8.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty LP.8.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty LP.8.1

## Comirnaty LP.8.1 should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:

- you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past.
- you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1 . In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty LP.8.1 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty LP.8.1

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine.

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV).

In adults 18 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

In older adults 65 years of age and older, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be given at the same time as a high dose flu and an RSV vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## 3. How Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

You will receive 1 injection, regardless whether you have received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty LP.8.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty LP.8.1
3. How Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given
4. Possible side effects

## 1. What Comirnaty LP.8.1 is and what it is used for

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty LP.8.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age.

The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.

As Comirnaty LP.8.1 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty LP.8.1

## Comirnaty LP.8.1 should not be given

- if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child:

- has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past.
- is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
- has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots.
- has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system.

There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.

As with any vaccine, Comirnaty LP.8.1 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected.

The efficacy of Comirnaty LP.8.1 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

## Children

Comirnaty LP.8.1 10 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 5 years.

There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations.

The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

## Other medicines and Comirnaty LP.8.1

Tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If your child is pregnant, tell your child's doctor, nurse or pharmacist before your child receives this vaccine.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used during pregnancy.

No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1 during breast-feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Data from women who were breast-feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty LP.8.1 can be used while breast-feeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention.

## 3. How Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given

Comirnaty LP.8.1 is given as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your child's upper arm.

Your child will receive 1 injection, regardless whether he/she has received a COVID-19 vaccine before.

If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, he/she should not receive a dose of Comirnaty LP.8.1 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose.

If your child is immunocompromised, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty LP.8.1.

If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty LP.8.1, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
