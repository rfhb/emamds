Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Baxter AG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 April 2013 an application for a variation including an extension of indication. This application concerns the following medicinal product: The following variation was requested: The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for paediatric population in the active immunization against A/H5N1 subtype of influenza virus. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC. In addition, the MAH proposed to update the safety information in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to be updated in accordance. Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9. The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. Information on paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/67/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/67/2011 was completed. The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/67/2011 (EMA/PDCO/808557/2012). 1.2.

Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction The widespread occurrence of highly pathogenic avian virus H5N1 infections in birds and the several H5N1 outbreaks in humans have raised concerns of a potential pandemic since H5 represents a new haemagglutinin subtype to which the human population have very little or no immunity. Vaccines represent the main prophylactic measure against pandemic influenza. Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter has initially been licensed as a mock up pandemic vaccine in 29 European countries under the trade name Celvapan. However, due to the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic and following a duplication of licenses by informed consent, Celvapan was varied into the pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccine after approval by the EU Commission on 06 October 2009. The duplicate H5N1 dossier was maintained under the name of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter. As of August 2012 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter is approved in a total of 32 countries worldwide. Additionally, authorisation for Singapore is pending approval. As it is a mock up vaccine, Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter can only be marketed following a strain change during an actual pandemic. Therefore, exposure to the product is limited to clinical trials. Pandemic Influenza vaccine H5N1 Baxter is composed of non-adjuvanted, purified, inactivated whole virions formulation of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 7.5µg HA, a clade 1 strain of human influenza type A, subtype H5N1, isolated in Vietnam as isolate n. 1203 in 2004. Since there is no data for Pandemic Influenza vaccine H5N1 Baxter in subjects under 18 years of age, the administration of the vaccine in case of a pandemic shall follow national recommendations. However, during the approval of the product the Company was asked to obtain at least limited data in children and adolescents since in a pandemic children may be very vulnerable to infection and so would constitute a special target group for vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Following the submission of study 810706 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, agreed by the CHMP 26 March 2013, the MAH applied now to include in the PI the paediatrics data from subjects 6 months to 17 years of age. Within this variation application Baxter also fulfils PAC P46020, including the update of the PI with the paediatric data of study 810706.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No separate Paediatric investigation plan (PIP) is available for the Pandemic Influenza vaccine H5N1 Baxter since the proposed H5N1 paediatric study was agreed to be included within the PIP for the prepandemic influenza Vepacel (EU/1/12/752/001-002). Positive compliance verification on the agreed paediatric study 810706 was conceded in January 2013 by the PDCO. Vepacel has the same active substance (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) and was licensed in Europe on 17 February 2012 for pre-pandemic from the age of 18 years onwards. Vepacel is also undergoing a variation for extension of indication to the paediatric population in parallel.

This phase1/2 clinical study was designed to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) in healthy male and female infants, children and adolescents from 6 months to 17 years. All subjects received a two dose regimen (7.5 μg or 3.75 μg HA per dose) of H5N1 influenza vaccine 21 days apart. A subset received additionally a booster vaccination of H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Indonesia/05/2005) 12 months after the primary vaccination (at the same dose used for primary vaccination). The study duration for each subject was at least 201 days, or approximately 381 days for the subset of subjects receiving a booster vaccination.

In this assessment report only the main results of study 810706 are summarised, as the study has been assessed already in January 2013 (please refer to P46-020). During the current procedure it was concluded that safety and immunogenicity data generated in the paediatric population are acceptable to support the use in children and thus should be included in the PI of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter. 2.2. Non-clinical aspects No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 2.3. Clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 2.4. Clinical efficacy 2.4.1. Main study Title of Study A Phase I/II Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Vero Cell-Derived Whole Virus H5N1 Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Infants, Children and Adolescents Aged 6 Months to 17 Years. Methods Medicinal product no longer authorised

Subjects were stratified by age as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stratum A : approximately 300 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years. Subjects in Stratum A were vaccinated with the 7.5 μg H5N1 HA antigen dose. A subset of at least 75 subjects received a booster vaccination.

<!-- image -->

- Rate of subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain associated with protection 21 days after the second vaccination defined as titre measured by Microneutralization (MN) test ≥ 1:20.

Stratum B : approximately 300 children aged 3 to 8 years. Subjects in Stratum B were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μg or 3.75 μg H5N1 HA antigen dose. A subset of at least 150 subjects (75 in each dose group) received a booster vaccination. Stratum C : approximately 70 infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months. Subjects in Stratum C were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μg or 3.75 μg H5N1 HA antigen dose. All subjects received a booster vaccination. Children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years were considered to be closest to adults in terms of immune status at baseline and safety responses, and therefore received the 7.5 μg dose only. Both the 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg doses were instead investigated in children aged 3 to 8 years. Based on potential concerns that half the adult dose may not be sufficiently immunogenic in the youngest subset, both the 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg doses were also investigated in children aged 6 to 35 months. All subjects received the primary vaccination as two injections of either 7.5 μg or 3.75 μg μg HA antigen strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at a 21-day interval via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or in the anterolateral muscle of the thigh depending on the age of the subject. On Day 360 a subset, comprising of at least 75 subjects from Stratum A, and at least 150 subjects from Stratum B (75 subjects in each dose group) and 70 subjects from Stratum C (35 subjects in each dose group) received a heterologous booster vaccination, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005) at the same dose used for primary vaccination. Objectives · To assess the safety and tolerability of a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years; · To assess the primary immune response to a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years; · To assess the immunogenicity of two different doses of a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants and children aged 6 months to 8 years; · To assess persistence of H5N1 influenza antibodies 360 days after the first vaccination with a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years; · To assess the immune response to a heterologous booster vaccination with a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years.

Healthy children were eligible for enrolment if they were 6 months to 17 years of age, with their parent(s) / legal representative providing signed consent form and able to understand the protocol requirements and to fill in the diary card. As recommended in Guideline EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006, the study was to enrol approximately 300 children and adolescents (9 to 17 years of age, Stratum A) and 300 children (3 to 8 years of age, Stratum B). Additionally, approximately 70 infants and young children (6 to 35 months of age, Stratum C) were to be enrolled in this study. Assuming an approximate dropout rate of 10%, it was expected that 270 subjects in Strata A and B (and 63 subjects in Stratum C) would have evaluable immunogenicity results after two vaccinations. Blinding (masking) This was a partially blinded study, i.e. single blinded for children aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B) and infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C) only. For this reason, measures to maintain blinding and unblinding are not applicable for this study. Assays and interpretation of results The immunogenicity parameters for the interpretation of the HI and SRH assays results that the MAH has adhered to are described in the Table below, based on current recommendations. Table 1. Criteria  for  antibody  response  (as  indicated  in  adults  and  elderly  for  seasonal  Influenza vaccines) CBER  =  Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation  and  Research;  CHMP  =  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use;  CI= Confidence Interval; LL = Lower limit It has been demonstrated that the MN assay is more sensitive and/or specific than the HI assay for detection of functional/protective antibodies against avian influenza strains. Thus immunogenicity evaluation was focused on the MN assay (any MN result &lt; 1:10 (undetectable) was expressed as 1:3.9 and considered negative), supported by antibody response determined by SRH. The SRH method was based on the passive haemolysis of erythrocytes (sheep or turkey), sensitized with influenza virus particles, by antibodies directed against the viral haemagglutinin in the presence of a complement.

## Results

<!-- image -->

For purposes of analysis, any MN result &lt; 1:10 (undetectable) is expressed as 1:3.9 and considered negative; SRH areas ≤ 4 mm 2  are considered negative; and any HI result &lt; 1:10 (undetectable) is expressed as 1:5 and considered negative.

Participant flow Baseline data Demographic data Both genders were relatively evenly represented in all three strata, and most subjects (&gt;90%) in Strata A and C were considered 'white;' in Stratum B 73.6% of subjects were white, and 22.9% were Asian in the 3.75 μg group and 76.2% of subjects were white and 23.1% were Asian in the 7.5 μg group. Baseline Antibody Titres Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Seroprotection pre-vaccination (Table 2)

In stratum A (9 to 17 years), 27.2% of subjects had antibody titres associated with protection ( ≥ 1:20) against the primary vaccination strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) at baseline as measured by MN.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among younger subjects, in strata B and C, baseline titre levels were low ( ≤ 1.4% as measured by MN). Comparable results were obtained for the PP dataset.

Baseline seropositivity rates as measured by SRH were mostly consistent with those determined by MN, although baseline SRH antibody titre levels associated with protection were observed in 15.6% of Stratum A subjects, which was a lower rate compared to MN assay results.

Two vaccinations 21 days apart with the Vero cell-derived H5N1 vaccine containing 7.5 μ g HA antigen of the clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain induced an antibody response associated with protection (MN titre ≥ 1:20) in 85.4% of older subjects (Stratum A: aged 9 to 17 years), as measured by the MN assay. Among subjects aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B), 72.9% of those receiving the 7.5μg dose showed a response associated with protection, compared to 57.1% of those receiving the 3.75 μg dose. For subjects aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C), 68.8% of subjects who received the 7.5 μg dose

Antibody response associated with seroprotection according to SRH was consistent with the MN assay results. Among subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 63.8% had antibody levels (SRH assay) associated with seroprotection after the first vaccination and 75.1% after the second vaccination (Table 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Stratum B, among subjects receiving the 7.5 μg dose, 46.1% showed antibody levels associated with protection after the first vaccination, compared to 75.4% after the second vaccination. The differences between the seroprotection rates of the two doses were not statistically significant.

Among Stratum C subjects (aged 6 to 35 months) who received the 7.5 μg dose, 13.8% and 63.0% of subjects showed antibody levels associated with protection, after the first and second vaccinations, respectively. The differences between the seroprotection rate of the two doses were not statistically significant (25.7% and 55.9 % for the toddles receiving the 3.75µg dose). The rate of antibody response associated with protection was also determined by HI against Vero cellderived and MDCK-derived A/Vietnam strains. Results were much lower and highly inconsistent with those determined by MN and SRH. 4. Antibody response 21 days after the first and second vaccination as measured by MN, HI and SRH assay. Antibody responses 21 days after the first and the second vaccination are displayed in Table 4. Results as measured by SRH assay were consistent to the MN results; GMTs according to the HI assay were much lower and highly inconsistent with those determined by MN and SRH. 5. Fold increase of antibody response 21 days after the first and second vaccination as compared to baseline as measured by MN, HI and SRH assay. The fold increase in antibody titre for Strata A, B and C (respectively), for the 7.5 μg dose group, was 1.6, 2.1, and 1.4 at Day 22 and 3.1, 6.3 and 6.8 at Day 43 as determined by MN assay. In the 3.75 μg dose group, in Strata B and C, the fold increases were 1.7 and 1.6 at Day 22 and 4.6 and 6.3 at Day 43. Results as determined by the SRH assay were similar to those of the MN assay; fold increases as determined by the HI assay were, again, much lower and highly inconsistent with those determined by MN and SRH. 6. Rate of subjects with seroconversion (defined as a minimum four fold titre increase as compared to baseline [for MN and HI assay] or as either a ≥ 25 mm ² haemolysis area after the vaccination in case of a negative pre-vaccination sample [ ≥ 4 mm2] or a ≥ 50% increase in haemolysis area if the pre-vaccination sample is &gt; 4 mm² [for SRH assay]) 21 days after the first and second vaccination as measured by MN, HI and SRH assay: Table 5.

When measured by MN assay seroconversion was observed in 9.1%, 16.4%, and 9.1% in Strata A, B and C (respectively), at 21 days after the first vaccination for the 7.5 μg dose study group; and 12.9% and 8.6% in Strata B and C (respectively), among those in the 3.75 μg dose group.

Results as determined by the SRH assay showed a similar trend compared to those of the MN assay; seroconversion rates according to the HI assay were much lower and highly inconsistent with those determined by MN and SRH (see Table below).

A substantial increase in seroconversion rate as measured by MN was observed after the second vaccination: 31.8%, 72.2%, and 65.6% in Strata A, B and C (respectively), for the 7.5 μg dose study group; and in 53.4% and 60.0% in Strata B and C (respectively), among those in the 3.75 μg dose group. Results as determined by SRH assay (see Table 5) were somewhat higher but generally support the MN assay results; the seroconversion rate in the oldest subjects (Stratum A) was significantly higher compared to the MN assay after the second vaccination (63.5%), which could be due to the higher baseline MN antibody levels observed in this age group. Seroconversion rates according to the HI assay were, again, much lower and highly inconsistent with those determined by MN and SRH. Table 6. Summary of priming (post dose-2, 7.5µg dose, seronegative and seropositive subjects at baseline- ITT) Persistence and Booster Genetic characterization of HA sequences of the majority of H5N1 viruses has demonstrated two distinct phylogenetic clades with non-overlapping case distributions. Clade 1 viruses circulated in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam and were responsible for human infections in those countries during 2004 and 2005 (e.g. A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Clade 2 viruses circulated in birds in China and Indonesia (during 2004-2005) and subsequently (during 2005-2006) spread westward to the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. Six different subclades of clade 2 have been recognized and three of these (subclades 1, 2 and 3) have been responsible for most of the human cases in Indonesia, China, and outside of Asia (e.g. A/Indonesia/05/2005). 7.

In the current applicable guidance for influenza vaccines it is highly recommended to evaluate immunological responses based on haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and /or serum radial haemolysis (SRH, only measuring IgG antibodies). The MAH interpretation of the HI and SRH results followed the immunogenicity requirements defined by the Note for Guidance on Harmonization for Influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96). Despite the uncertainties whether the CHMP serological criteria are equally valid for pandemic vaccines as for seasonal influenza vaccines and for the evaluation of immunogenicity in adults as in the paediatric population, for the time being the mentioned CHMP immunogenicity criteria remain a useful benchmark and the approach pursued in this dossier is acceptable. Cell mediated immunity (CMI) could have been explored. However, it is recognised that in paediatric trials the amount of blood needed for such analysis represent a limitation for measurement of CMI and clinically validated assays exist.

10. Rate of subjects with seroconversion 21 days after the booster vaccination as measured by MN, HI and SRH assay: Table 9. Rate of subjects with seroconversion compared to Day 361 (%) Age group 9-17 years 3-8 years 6-36 months (Source: Table 21, 29 and 34 of the study report) 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies The study was overall well conducted. The dropout rate (13.5%) was low for such long study duration. The number of subjects to be enrolled in Stratum C has been reduced (from initially 300 to at least 70 subjects) in response to difficulties in enrolment due to the concomitant H1N1 pandemic (Amendment 4, version 2011 Mar 09). It is agreed that the inclusion of a higher number of children was difficult to arrange at a later stage, therefore this modification was deemed acceptable. Additionally, in order to reduce the burden on study participants, the number of subjects receiving the 12-months booster has been reduced (Amendment 3, version 2010 Dec21), which is acceptable. This is in line with the 'Guideline on influenza vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier' (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006), which allows for some degree of extrapolation if it is not possible to generate data from all age and risk categories.

Regarding the HI assays low responsiveness was observed throughout all analyses most probably due to a low sensitivity of the assay. This finding is consistent with other H5N1 vaccines.

With regards to the MN assay, similar parameters to HI and SRH were defined by the MAH using a cutoff of ≥ 1:20. The MN assay is based on the ability of neutralizing antibodies to prevent the attachment of virus to cells as well as intracellular penetration and propagation. Such assays are commonly used to detect protective antibodies in human reconvalescent sera or sera from vaccinees. At present, however, a neutralising antibody titre associated with protection against a potential pandemic strain has not been clinically validated yet. The MAH conducted studies in mice to show that the cut-off titre of 1:20 is appropriately defined for the MN assay and that the neutralising antibody response as measured in cell culture corresponds to a functional immune response in vivo. Standard SRH assays were conducted to confirm the results obtained with the MN assay. Validation reports for both the SRH and the MN assay were already provided during the initial MAA for the product. Priming Following administration of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter, seroconversion and seroneutralization rates are slightly lower in comparison with those obtained in children (3-17 years) vaccinated with Celvapan (H1N1). This is expected due to the low immunogenicity of H5N1 and other purely avian strains vs. H1N1 pandemic virus. However, after priming with 7.5µg of the candidate vaccine most of the CHMP criteria are fulfilled and the results are comparable with those achieved in adults and elderly (H5N1). Of note, after the first dose the rate of infants and toddlers with neutralizing antibody titres ≥ 20 (MN) were lower than those of adults and elderly once (17.1 % and 3.0 % vs. 44.4 % and 51.9 %, respectively). This is probably explained by lower rates of subjects with pre-existing antibody titres and emphasizes the need of two doses especially for naïve subjects. Surprisingly, according to baseline data a proportion of study subjects was not immunologically naïve to H5N1, and some subjects even had titres in the seroprotective range against H5N1 (up to 27.2% for stratum A in the MN assay). Thus during the procedure the MAH was asked to present all MN and SRH results for study 810706 according to baseline seronegativity (i.e. separately for subjects with baseline MN titre &lt;1:3.9 and baseline SRH titre &lt;1:5 and subjects with baseline MN titre &gt;1:3.9 and baseline SRH titre &gt;1:5 ). The analysis of the immune response in children seronegative at baseline show that all three age cohorts develop adequate seroconversion rates and GM fold increases 21 days after the second vaccination. The observed seroprotection rates are lower than those in subjects seropositive at baseline. In conclusion, the immune response in children immunologically naïve or seronegative at baseline is considered to be comparable with the immune response observed in the overall adult population previously studied (trials 810705, 810601). With the lower dose of 3.75 µg, seroprotection was missed in age strata B and C with both assays. Furthermore, point estimates of antibody titres, fold increase and percent seroconversion/seroprotection, were substantially lower than for the full dose, showing a clear dose effect and the need for the full dose in order to achieve a serological response in the three paediatric age groups, which would be comparable to the response seen in healthy adult vaccinees.

The surprisingly high rates (by MN and SRH) of children 9-17 years with high seroneutralising antibodies ( ≥ 1:20), which have been noted, might be due to the fact that older children have been vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines (or exposed to circulating seasonal strains) and thus an antibody response against N1 is at least partially responsible for the pre-existing immunity towards H5N1 viruses. It is unlikely that these children have already a specific immunity against H5N1.

## Persistence and booster

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For all age groups, a moderate decline in antibody titres occurred during a time period of one year. The MN- or SRH-based analyses (Pre-boost) using the A/Indonesia strain revealed that a proportion of subjects after priming with the A/Vietnam strain gained cross-neutralizing antibodies.

<!-- image -->

Booster vaccination with a heterologous vaccine strain (A/Indonesia/2005, clade2) showed a clear increase in antibody titres for all age groups. The criterion set for seroprotection (i.e. at least 70% of adults with a protective titre) has been achieved in all age groups (using MN and SRH assay). The fact that the response profile and magnitude following the heterologous booster (A/Indonesia) has been similar to the homologous booster indicates that the vaccine can produce a good cross-clade memory response. As a conclusion, booster outcomes achieved in the different age strata are comparable to each other and to effects observed in healthy adults. 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy The immunogenicity results presented for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter are acceptable and indicate that good levels of protection should be achieved in vaccinees from 6 months of age onwards using a two 7.5 ug HA dose vaccination schedule 21 days apart. Antibody levels seem to modestly decrease over time, as expected. Following up with a booster 12 months after a 2-dose primary vaccination induces a strong antibody response against both strains used for the booster or primary vaccinations. This demonstrates the vaccine's ability to induce a cross-reactive memory response after a two dose priming that can be effectively boosted up to one year after initial priming in infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years. 2.5. Clinical safety 2.5.1. Introduction Overall for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter safety data are available in adults from four completed clinical studies (phase 1/2 study 810501, phase 3 study 810601, phase 1/2 study 810701, and phase 2 study 810703) and one partially completed study (phase 3 study 810705). In these studies, 4535 subjects were exposed to at least one vaccine dose of the Vero cell-derived H5N1 influenza vaccine. The safety results of all five clinical studies are highly consistent. The most frequently reported systemic reaction after vaccination was headache (which occurred in 10.8% of adults and 8.5% of elderly after the first vaccination, according to the pooled safety data on the relevant vaccine formulation). Other commonly reported systemic reactions were fatigue, malaise, chills, myalgia, hyperhidrosis, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, pyrexia and pharyngolaryngeal pain. Systemic reactions were mostly mild. Of interest, fever occurred only at a low rate (with the highest point estimate across all studies being 4.8% in the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted group in study 810501), and was mostly mild in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported local reaction: it was very common in subjects aged &lt; 60 years after both the first (11.4%) and the second vaccination (10.2%), but was reported less often by elderly subjects (5.0% and 2.8% after first and second vaccination respectively). Other local reactions that were commonly reported were injection site haemorrhage, injection site induration and swelling. In general, in adults the frequency of local as well as systemic adverse events was lower after the second than after the first vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serious adverse reactions (SARs) occurred in adults only at a low rate, and no common pattern or apparent safety signal emerged from these SAEs that were assessed to be (possibly) related to vaccination.

## Study 810706

Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (AEs) that occurred within 7 or 21 days after vaccination, regardless of the presumed relationship between the event and the study product. AEs were grouped by system organ class. Each event was divided into defined severity grades (mild, moderate and severe). All AEs were described on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using standard medical terminology and graded by the investigator for severity and relatedness to the study product based on the criteria specified in the study protocol. Patient exposure The H5N1 influenza vaccine was administered in a 2-dose primary vaccination scheme at a 21-day interval, followed by a heterologous booster 360 days after the first vaccination. Healthy infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years (N=675) were administered the first vaccination with the H5N1 vaccine containing the strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at a dose of 7.5 μg (N=300: Stratum A, N=153: Stratum B, and N=36: Stratum C) or 3.75 μg (N=150: Stratum B, and N=36: Stratum C), and 657 received a second vaccination at the same HA dose 21 days after the first (7.5 μg: N=296: Stratum A, N=148: Stratum B, and N=34: Stratum C; 3.75 μg: N=143: Stratum B, and N=36: Stratum C). The booster vaccination, containing the strain A/Indonesia/05/2005, was administered to 402 subjects 360 days after the first vaccination (7.5 μg: N=191: Stratum A, N=77: Stratum B, and N=28: Stratum C; 3.75 μg: N=73: Stratum B, and N=33: Stratum C). Adverse events Most of the subjects did not report any systemic or local reactions after vaccination (Table below). The highest rate of reporting was after the first vaccination compared to the second and booster vaccination. No real dose dependency was seen between the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose groups in regards to frequency of adverse events in the age group 3 to 8 years. In Stratum B (6 months to 35 months) a slightly higher rate of systemic reactions was observed in the higher dose group compared to the lower dose group. Table 10.

systemic reactions were reported in the period from 7 to 21 days after the first vaccination as shown by the slight increase in systemic reaction rates observed within 21 days after first vaccination (Table above).The majority of reactions were mild to moderate in severity.

Within 21 days after the second vaccination, systemic reaction rates (excluding fever) were 18.6% of subjects in Stratum A, 9.4% and 12.0% in Stratum B, and 29.4% and 27.8% in Stratum C in the 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg dose groups respectively. Severe systemic reactions occurring after the first and second vaccinations were: fatigue and nausea (1 subject), arthralgia and myalgia (1 subject), vomiting, myalgia and headache (1 subject), nasopharyngitis (1 subject) and myalgia (1 subject), fatigue (1 subject) in Stratum A and cough (1 subject) in Stratum C. The most commonly-reported specifically queried symptoms after the first and second vaccinations were headache, malaise, fatigue and muscle pain in Strata A and B, and irritability, nonsalable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep, loss of appetite and drowsiness in Stratum C. Systemic reaction rates (excluding fever) within 21 days of the booster vaccination with the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were: 21.5% in Stratum A, 10.3% and 13.9% in Stratum B, and 17.9% and 6.1% in Stratum C in the 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg dose groups respectively. The majority of reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Severe systemic reactions occurring after the booster vaccination were headache (1 subject) and fatigue (1 subject) in Stratum A. The most commonly-reported specifically queried symptoms after the booster vaccination were headache, malaise, fatigue and muscle pain in Strata A and B, and irritability, loss of appetite and drowsiness in Stratum C. Fever Fever occurred at low rates after each vaccination, with generally lower rates after the second and booster vaccination as compared to the first vaccination. Fever rates within 7 days after the first, second and booster vaccination ranged from 1.0% to 2.7% in Stratum A, from 1.4% to 6.4% in Stratum B, and from 10.7% to 19.4% in Stratum C. The majority of fever cases were ≤ 38.4 ° C (only five subjects had body temperatures of ≥ 39.5 ° C, with a highest reported body temperature of 40.0 ° C). Table 11.

Non-serious reactions The symptoms are displayed in the following 3 tables after the first vaccination, after the second vaccination and after booster vaccination respectively. First vaccination After the first vaccination Injection site pain was mostly reported in all age Strata. In Stratum A Injection site pain and Headache were reported with a high incidence. With a lower incidence Injection site pain, Headache and Fatigue were reported in Stratum B compared to Stratum A. The younger age group reported disturbed sleep and Irritability with the highest incidence. Second vaccination With a lower frequency but with still the highest incidences Injection site pain, Headache and Fatigue were reported in Stratum A and B after the second vaccination compared to the first vaccination. Almost with the same frequency Injection site pain, Irritability and Disturbed sleep were reported in Stratum C after the second vaccination compared to the first vaccination. Booster vaccination Injection site pain was reported with a higher frequency after the booster vaccination compared to the second vaccination in Stratum A and B. All other reported events were documented with a lower frequency compared to vaccination 1 and 2 in all age Strata. Less severe reactions were reported after the booster vaccination compared to first and second vaccination, although less children were vaccinated with the booster vaccine (see Table below).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events There were no deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs reported during the study. In total 8 SAEs were reported, which were not associated to the study vaccine (Hennoch-Schonlein purpurea, acute appendicitis, stomach pain, ankle fracture, stomatitis, visual field defect, abdominal injury and conjunctivitis viral). The majority (~70%) of subjects did not experience any systemic or injection site reactions after vaccination and no real dose effect was seen in Stratum B and C who received either 7.5 µg or 3.75 µg HA per vaccination. Laboratory findings Alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were determined prior to the first vaccination (Day 1), prior to the second vaccination (Day 22) and 21 days after the second vaccination (Day 43) in the first approximately 100 subjects in Stratum A (children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years) and Stratum B (children aged 3 to 8 years). Only 1 subject showed an abnormal result with a toxicity grade of 1 on Day 43. Safety in special populations Not applicable.

Discussion on clinical safety In summary these are the key elements gathered from the safety follow-up period following H5N1 administration: · There were no deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs reported during the study; · In total 8 SAEs were reported, which were not associated to the study vaccine (HennochSchonlein purpurea, acute appendicitis, stomach pain, ankle fracture, stomatitis, visual field defect, abdominal injury and conjunctivitis viral); · The majority (~ 70%) of subjects did not experience any systemic or injection site reactions after vaccination and no real dose effect was seen in Stratum B and C who received either 7.5 µg or 3.75 µg HA per vaccination; · Injection site reaction rates within 21 days after vaccination were ≤ 30.4% in Stratum A, ≤ 37.2% and ≤ 30.6% in Stratum B and ≤ 19.4% and ≤ 19.4% in Stratum C, in the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ g dose group, respectively. The most commonly reported specifically queried symptom after each vaccination was injection site pain in all three strata; · Systemic reaction rates within 21 days after the first, second and booster vaccination were ≤ 30.3% in Stratum A, ≤ 16.3% and ≤ 21.3% in Stratum B and ≤ 36.1% and ≤ 30.6% in Stratum C, in the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ g dose group, respectively. The most commonly reported specifically queried symptoms of systemic reactions after each vaccination were headache, malaise, fatigue and muscle pain in Strata A and B. In Stratum C, irritability, inconsolable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep, loss of appetite and drowsiness were the most commonly reported symptoms after the first and second vaccination and irritability, loss of appetite and drowsiness were most commonly reported after the booster vaccination; · Fever occurred at low rates after each vaccination, with generally lower rates after the second and booster vaccination as compared to the first vaccination. Fever rates within 7 days after the first, second and booster vaccination ranged from 1.0% to 2.7% in Stratum A, from 1.4% to 6.4% in Stratum B, and from 10.7% to 19.4% in Stratum C. The majority of fever cases were ≤ 38.4 ° C (only five subjects had body temperatures of ≥ 39.5 ° C, with a highest reported body temperature of 40.0 ° C). · Adverse reactions were predominantly mild or moderate in severity. Severe reactions (although non-serious) were experienced by a total of 14 subjects; all subjects recovered from these symptoms without sequelae. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the event of a pandemic, vaccination is universally regarded as the most important public health intervention for preventing infection or reducing disease severity, which applies for both adults (including elderly) and children. Moreover, particularly children may be vulnerable to infection and so constitute a special group for vaccination.

Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in this study. The safety and reactogenicity profile of H5N1 seen was as expected, based on previous experience with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

this vaccine in adults and elderly once. The rank order of frequency of each solicited systemic reaction observed in this study differed slightly in the younger population: pyrexia was numerically more frequent in children than in adults and elderly once. Systemic reactions observed in the study were numerically in same frequency reported in children as in adults and elderly, e.g. pain. 8 unrelated SAEs were reported within the study and 14 subjects reported severe systemic or local reactions after vaccination. Concerning abnormal laboratory results 1 subject showed an abnormal result.

3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Beneficial effects Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter is a vaccine to protect against influenza caused by the H5N1 subtype of the influenza A virus in an officially declared pandemic. Vaccination is considered to be the most effective option to limit the spread or severity of a pandemic. Since avian influenza H5N1 is viewed as a possible candidate for a pandemic, an effective vaccine against this highly pathogenic virus is needed also in children. Study 810706 shows that a two-dose vaccination with 7.5 µg A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine administered 21 days apart induces a substantial antibody response in healthy subjects from 6 months to 17 years old. Specifically, 85.4% of subjects aged 9 to 17 years (Stratum A) reached antibody titres associated with protection (MN titre ≥ 1:20) at 21 days after the second vaccination, as well as 72.9% of subjects aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B) and 68.6% of subjects aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C). Good immunogenicity results were also confirmed by SRH assay, in line with the results of the healthy adult population. A booster vaccination with a cross-clade influenza H5N1 strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005) administered 12 months after a 2-dose primary vaccination also induces a strong antibody response against both the strains used either for the booster or primary vaccinations. This demonstrates the vaccine's ability to induce a cross-reactive memory response after a two dose priming that can be effectively boosted up to one year after initial priming in infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects Lower, but still acceptable, immune responses are measured in the younger age group vs. the older ones. The reason for this is not fully understood, however it is believed that it might reflect a greater exposure of older subjects to seasonal influenza viruses or vaccines (possibly N1 antigens) and it might also be linked to the immune system being under development in the youngest. Study 810706 did not include immunocompromised and chronically ill paediatric subjects, however the immunogenicity of the vaccine in these subjects is not expected to differ substantially from immunocompromised and chronically ill adults subjects, which were previously studied.

In study 810706, a total of 675 subjects received the first vaccination on Day 1 with either 7.5 μg or 3.75 μg HA antigen strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004. Of these subjects, 657 received the second vaccination of HA antigen strain A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 on Day 21 at the same dose as Day 1. Of those subjects who received two primary vaccinations, 402 received the booster vaccination of HA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigen strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 on Day 361 with the same dose as used in the primary vaccination. Key results are summarised as follows:

- Within 7 days after the first vaccination, systemic reaction rates (excluding fever) in the 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg dose groups respectively were: 30.0% in Stratum A, 15.7% and 20.7% in Stratum B, and 33.3% and 30.6% in Stratum C, of which most were mild or moderate, except for 5 subjects in Stratum A, who reported severe systemic reactions. Symptoms lasted a few days and all subjects recovered.

•

· In general, the rates of systemic reactions (excluding fever) after the first and second vaccination were acceptable and comparable to the rates previously observed in the adult population. The frequency differed only slightly between the 7 days and the 21 days window after the first vaccination. In two subjects severe systemic reactions (severe fatigue, severe cough) occurred after the second vaccination. Both subjects recovered. The rates of systemic reactions after the booster vaccination were lower than after the first and second vaccination. Only two subjects experienced severe systemic reactions which both lasted less than 24 hours. · The majority of injection site reactions were mild in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported injection site reaction in all age groups. There were four subjects for whom severe local reactions were reported after the first and second vaccination, respectively. All subjects recovered from these symptoms. The rates of injection site reactions were higher in all age groups when compared to the adult population. No severe injection site reactions were reported after the booster vaccination. The most frequently reported local reaction in all age groups was injection site pain. · The most commonly reported specifically queried symptoms for the first and second vaccinations were headache, malaise, fatigue and muscle pain in Strata A and B, and irritability, inconsolable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep disorder, loss of appetite and drowsiness for Stratum C. Similar results were shown after booster vaccination, but with lower frequency. The nature of the most frequently reported specifically queried symptoms is not unusual. The frequency is overall slightly higher when compared to the adult and elderly population. · Fever occurred at low rates after each vaccination, with generally lower rates after the second and booster vaccination as compared to the first vaccination. Fever rates ranged from 1.0% to 2.7% in Stratum A, from 1.4% to 6.4% in Stratum B and from 10.7% to 19.4% in Stratum C. The majority of fever cases were ≤ 38.4 ° C. There was only one subject (Stratum B, 7.5µg dose group) with fever &gt;40°C (occurring 6 days after vaccination, duration 3 days) related to the first vaccination and there were no subjects with fever &gt;39.4°C related to the second vaccination. Furthermore, there were no subjects with fever &gt;39.9°C related to the booster vaccination. · No AEs related to the primary vaccinations occurred between 21 days after the second vaccination and 360 days after the first vaccination except one subject. There were no deaths or serious adverse events related to vaccination during the entire study period. Adverse reactions were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. No safety concerns arose from the laboratory results. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No safety signals have been identified in the age group from 6 months to 17 years. The number of patients is not sufficient to detect rare events, but this is expected as rare events can only be detected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in post-marketing settings due to the very large size otherwise needed to power clinical trials. Study 810706 did not include immunocompromised and chronically ill paediatric subjects, however the safety profile is not expected to differ substantially from healthy children.

Benefit-Risk Balance This application concerns the potential use in children of the vaccine in a declared pandemic only, i.e. an emergency situation. Albeit limited, the number of children, particularly of toddlers (6 to 36 months) studied for this application is in line with the 'Guideline on influenza vaccines prepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core dossier' (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006). Additionally, the data generated with Celvapan (H1N1), which was used during the last pandemic, may be considered as supportive as these vaccines are similarly manufactured. Celvapan is approved for all age groups, the only exception are children below the age of 6 months. A prime-boost vaccination strategy of a two dose primary vaccination with an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine followed by a heterologous H5N1 influenza booster vaccination was shown to be well tolerated in a paediatric population at the age of 6 months to 17 years. This vaccination schedule was shown to induce a broad humoral immune response in all age groups, similar to those in adults or elderly. Additionally, the candidate vaccine demonstrated its ability to induce a long-lasting cross-clade immunological memory that can be effectively boosted up to one year followed by a two dose primary schedule. Cellular immunity and efficacy has not been tested for comprehensible reasons (avian influenza strains are highly pathogenic, not circulating and CMI in children would require a large amount of blood to be drawn). Moreover, the submitted data indicate that the vaccine was shown to be safe and well tolerated in a paediatric population from the age of 6 months to 17 years. The Vero cell line culture technology used for production of this influenza vaccine provides a theoretically added safety for individuals with egg allergies. After vaccination with this inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine it is anticipated that the majority of subjects receiving this vaccine will be protected against avian influenza caused by the strain contained in the vaccine and are expected to benefit from some level of protection against avian influenza caused by closely related strains. In conclusion, the benefit risk balance of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine H5N1 Baxter is considered to be positive in the paediatric population in all investigated age groups and the extension of indication is deemed approvable. 4. Recommendations The application for extension of indication to the paediatric population is approvable since all remaining concerns have been resolved.
