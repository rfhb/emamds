## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 28 August 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to add the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma based on the results of the pivotal study GAO4753g. Consequently, updates to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC, the Package Leaflet and RMP have been proposed. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Gazyvaro was designated as an orphan medicinal product (EU/3/15/1504) in the following indication: treatment of follicular lymphoma on 19 June 2015.

The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions CW/0001/2015 and CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Protocol assistance

The MAH received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 21 October 2010 (EMEA/H/SA/1269/2/FU/1/2010/II) and 29 May 2009 (EMEA/H/SA/1269/2/2009/II). The Protocol Assistance pertained to clinical aspects.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) is a glyco-engineered, Type II mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG1 subclass, recognizing an epitope of the CD20 molecule found on B cells (Beers et al, 2008; Herter et al, 2013). It was approved in the EU for use in combination with chlorambucil in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL in November 2013.

B-cell lymphomas, including iNHLs, are characterized by the expression of a membrane antigen, CD20. Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  are  B-lymphoproliferative  disorders  that  include  a  heterogeneous  group  of malignancies,  ranging  from  slow-growing,  indolent  non-Hodgkin  lymphomas  (iNHLs),  which  comprise about a third of all NHLs, to more aggressive forms of NHL. Subtypes of iNHL are follicular lymphoma (FL),  marginal  zone  lymphoma  (MZL),  lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma  with  or  without  Waldenström's macroglobulinemia  [LPL/WM]  and  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  (SLL).  FL  accounts  for  approximately 20%-25% of all new NHLs and 70% of iNHLs (The Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Classification Project 1997). SLL  is  an  uncommon  disorder,  comprising  6%  of  iNHLs  and  15%  of  cases  of  the  CLL/SLL  entity (Tsimberidou et al. 2007; Nola et al. 2004), classified as same biological entity with CLL according to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

WHO. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common lymphoma diagnosed in the United States and Western Europe, representing approximately 22% of all NHLs and 70% of iNHL. The median age at diagnosis is 59 years and median survival is 8-10 years.

Follicular lymphoma is defined as a mature B-cell neoplasm in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Follicular lymphoma cells are malignant counterparts of normal germinal center B cells. Approximately 85% of patients with FL have a genomic translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), which results in the overexpression of the BCL-2 protein, a member of a family  of  proteins  that  blocks  programmed  cell  death  or  apoptosis.  FL  is  chemo-sensitive  and  with  a generally good prognosis at diagnosis, however in resistant and refractory stages the current treatment alternatives are limited.

Rituximab (Mabthera) a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD20, has been authorised in the EU as monotherapy for patients with stage III-IV FL who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; improved progression-free survival (PFS) or event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with FL (Hiddemann et al, 2005; Herold et al, 2007; Marcus et al,  2008;  Salles  et  al,  2008)  has  been  shown.  Improved  efficacy  has  also  been  demonstrated  with rituximab in  patients  with  MZL  and  SLL  (McLaughlin  et  al.  1998;  Foran  et  al.  2000;  Hainsworth  et  al. 2003; Rummel et al. 2013).

Data from a range of clinical trials suggest that the quality and duration of response to induction therapy are  factors  that  predict  survival  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  and  relapsed  FL;  patients  who achieve a complete response that is maintained for a prolonged period of time tend to survive longer than other patients. As a result, there has been much interest in post-induction therapy for patients with FL. Two  main  approaches  have  been  evaluated:  consolidation,  consisting  of  a  single  or  short  course  of therapy; and maintenance, in which treatment is continued for a prolonged period of time (theoretically until relapse, but in practice, usually limited to around 2 years).

In the European Union, rituximab maintenance for up to 2 years is approved for patients with previously untreated FL and for patients with relapsed/refractory FL, after induction therapy. This has been shown to have  an  acceptable  safety  profile  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  disease  and  in  patients  with relapsed/refractory  disease.  Based  on  a  systematic  meta-analysis,  rituximab  maintenance  has  been shown to substantially prolong PFS and OS even after antibody containing induction (although the OS benefit  was  only  shown  in  relapsed  patients  who  did  not  receive  rituximab  during  first-line  induction treatment). Both ESMO and the NCCN guidelines indicate that the efficacy of maintenance rituximab in the second-line setting is likely to be influenced by the efficacy of maintenance rituximab in the first-line setting.  The  NCCN  guidelines  state  that  if  a  patient  progressed  during  or  within  6  months  of  first  line maintenance rituximab, the clinical benefit of maintenance rituximab in the second-line setting is likely to be very minimal and ESMO guidelines state that second-line maintenance rituximab probably should not be used for patients who had relapsed during their first maintenance period.

Radioimmunotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy have all been investigated as potential forms of post-induction  therapy  in  patients  with  FL  in  the  first-line  and/or  relapsed/refractory  setting; 90 Yibritutomab tiuxetan is approved as consolidation therapy for patients with FL in first remission but not in the relapsed/refractory setting. Interferon-alpha (for 18 months) is licensed as an adjunct to induction combination chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen, for patients with FL and a high tumour burden, but its use is limited by toxicity and inconvenience of administration. Relatively few studies have been conducted with maintenance chemotherapy and this is not established in FL.

As  the  disease  becomes  increasingly  resistant  to  chemotherapy  and  to  rituximab  as  well  as  histologic transformation to high-grade NHL can occur which are more aggressive than the original iNHL and has a poor  outcome.  Overall,  about  50%  of  patients  with  FL  die  within  5  years  of  first  relapse/progression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Montoto et al. 2004; Causoli et al, 2015), but the median OS of patients with FL who develop histological transformation is estimated to 1-2 years (Al-Tourah et al. 2008).

The  alkylating  agent  bendamustine  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with rituximab-refractory  iNHL,  demonstrating  an  overall  response  rate  (ORR)  of  approximately  75%,  a complete response (CR) rate of approximately 15%, a median DoR of 6.7-9.2 months, and a median PFS of 7.1-9.3 months (Friedberg et al. 2008; Kahl et al. 2010). As disease remissions are relatively short with bendamustine, there is still a medical need for new therapeutic options for patients with iNHL after failure of rituximab-based therapy.

The MAH applied to extend the indication as follows:

Gazyvaro  (Obinutuzumab)  in  combination  with  bendamustine  followed  by  Gazyvaro  (Obinutuzumab) maintenance is indicated for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond to or who  progressed  during  or  up  to  6  months  after  treatment  with  rituximab  or  a  rituximab-containing regimen.

The recommended dose of Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) when used in combination with Bendamustine is 1000 mg as an intravenous infusion on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1, on day 1 of cycles 2-6, and then every 2 months thereafter until progression or for up to 2 years (whichever was earlier).

The proposed indication, falls within the orphan designation: treatment of follicular  lymphoma (EU/3/15/1504, granted on 19 June 2015).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

All  relevant  pharmacology  studies,  multiple  dose  PK  and  TK  studies  as  well  as  toxicology  studies conducted in support of obinutuzumab development were included in the initial license application. Two additional toxicology studies contributing to the overall evaluation of the obinutuzumab safety profile and relevant to this application were completed since submission of the initial license application in CLL and are discussed here in the context of the overall toxicology program.

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Two supplemental in vitro studies were performed post-approval.

To exclude that the unexpected staining of endothelial cells observed in human and monkey tissue crossreactivity studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques, an additional study was submitted (Report No. 1061540) using different tissue donors (see toxicology section). In addition, another in vitro toxicology study (Report No. 1062523) was designed to explore  the  role  of  cytokine  release  in  the  increased  infusion-related  reactions  (IRR)  incidence  and severity observed in obinutuzumab-treated versus rituximab-treated patients.

## 2.2.2. Pharmacology

No new pharmacology studies were included in this submission.

Report No. 1061540: A Tissue cross -reactivity study of obinutuzumab in normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  potential  cross  reactivity  of  RO5072759  with cryosections of human and non-human primate (cynomolgus monkey) tissues.

Tissues were collected as surgical or autopsy specimens from humans (Table 1) and necropsy specimens from  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Unfixed  tissues  as  received  from  the  tissue  suppliers  were  considered essentially  normal.  Tissues  were  from  a  different  set  of  human  and  cynomolgus  donors  (at  least  3 different donors per tissue) and the secondary labelled antibody used was different than in the previous studies; all other assay procedures were similar to the earlier studies.

After pathology review, it was determined that some of the tissue samples did not contain a sufficient amount of the required tissue for evaluation or were determined to be unsuitable for evaluation due to tissue morphology. Therefore, additional samples of the tissue were stained and evaluated to obtain the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

required three samples of each tissue; however, there were only two viable donors of cervix evaluated within the study timeframe.

In the human tissue panel, obinutuzumab showed membrane and cytoplasmic staining of mononuclear leukocytes (B lymphocytes) and cytoplasmic staining was seen in endothelium, epithelium/myoepithelium,  and  platelets.  In  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues,  cytoplasmic  staining  was observed  in  endothelium,  epithelium,  cerebellar  granular  layer  cells  and  neural  processes,  and  skin follicular root sheaths.

The cytoplasmic staining of endothelial cells was observed in a similar range of tissues between human and  monkey  tissues,  with  no  membranous  endothelial  staining  being  observed  in  either  species.  In contrast  to  the  previous  TCR  studies  performed  with  RO5072759,  there  was  no  membrane  staining observed, in neither human nor cynomolgus monkey tissues, except for B lymphocytes.

In  conclusion,  data  from  the  new  TCR study demonstrated lack of membranous staining of endothelial cells  and,  according  to  the  MAH,  provided  additional  data  to  confirm  the  inherent  variability  of  the unexpected staining and to support the lack of any direct effect of obinutuzumab on endothelial cells in vivo.

The  results  of  this  study  may  support  that  the  unexpected  staining  of  endothelial  cells  observed  in previous  human  and  monkey  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies,  may  not  indicate  a  direct  binding  of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques.

## Report  No.  1062523:  Obinutuzumab  Rituximab-  and  Ofatumumab-induced  cytokine  release  in  human whole blood)

This  additional  whole  blood  cell  assay  was  designed  to  explore  the  role  of  cytokine  release  in  the increased  IRR  rate  and  severity  observed  in  obinutuzumab-treated  versus  rituximab-treated  patients. Whole blood from 13 healthy donors was incubated with 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ug/mL obinutuzumab, and other  CD20  antibodies  rituximab  and  ofatumumab,  as  well  as  the  comparators  alemtuzumab  and cetuximab.  After  24  hours  IL6,  IL8,  TNFα,  IFNγ,  interleutkin-2  (IL2),  interleukin-12p70  (IL12p70), interleukin-1 beta (IL1β), interleukin-1 alpha (IL1α) and interleukin-10 (IL10) released into the plasma was measured. In addition, immunophenotyping was performed to identify changes in the numbers of B cells,  T  cells  and  NK  cells.  Additionally  expression  of  the  activation  marker  CD11b  on  neutrophils  was monitored.  Obinutuzumab  induced  stronger  cytokine  release,  increased  up-regulation  of  CD11b  and stronger B cell depletion than rituximab and ofatumumab in this assay.

## 2.2.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessement was submitted (See discussion on non-clinical aspects).

## 2.2.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The active substance in Gazyvaro, obinutuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody that has been designed using recombinant DNA technology to recognise and attach to the protein CD20, which is found on the surface of all B-lymphocytes. In the current indication, CLL, cancerous B- lymphocytes multiply too quickly and replace the normal cells in the bone marrow, and are unable to function properly. By attaching to CD20 on B-lymphocytes of patients with CLL, obinutuzumab causes the death of these abnormal lymphocytes.

All  relevant  pharmacology  studies,  multiple  dose  PK  and  TK  studies  as  well  as  toxicology  studies conducted in support of obinutuzumab development were included in the initial license application. Two additional toxicology studies contributing to the overall evaluation of the obinutuzumab safety profile and relevant to this application were completed since submission of the initial license application in CLL and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

are discussed here in the context of the overall toxicology program.

Obinutuzumab was evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys up to 26 weeks in duration. Cynomolgus monkey was selected as the species of choice in the safety assessment of obinutuzumab on the basis of its high target sequence homology and comparable target binding affinities to human, Fcmediated effector function, and tissue cross-reactivity results.

Toxicology studies were conducted in monkeys at dose levels ranging from 5 to 100 mg/kg body weight i.v. Treatment-related findings across all toxicology studies were related to the pharmacological action of obinutuzumab, to secondary opportunistic infections and/or to hypersensitivity reactions.

An enhanced pre- and postnatal development study revealed a complete depletion of B-lymphocytes in all infants with a return to almost normal levels by 168 days postpartum, indicating that a long-lasting effect of treatment on immune function is unlikely. There was no evidence of any treatment-related effects on embryo-fetal development, parturition, postnatal survival, and growth and development of infants.

In vitro assays using undiluted human whole blood measured significant increases in cytokine secretion caused by obinutuzumab, indicating that obinutuzumab has the propensity to cause first infusion-related cytokine release in patients.

Immunohistochemical staining in frozen cynomolgus monkey and human tissue sections was in general comparable with the reported tissue expression of CD20. However, cross reactivity of obinutuzumab was also  present  in  human  bile  duct  epithelia,  salivary  glands,  and  endothelium  of  the  lung  as  well  as  on membrane and cytoplasm of monkey endothelium in the following tissues: small intestine, heart, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, prostate, salivary gland, testis, and endometrium.

Two supplementary toxicology studies (ex vivo and in vitro) were submitted for this extension application.

To exclude that the unexpected staining of endothelial cells observed in human and monkey tissue crossreactivity studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques. One study investigated the potential cross reactivity of obinutuzumab with cryosections of human and non-human primate (cynomolgus monkey) tissues.  The  objective  was  to  exclude  that  the unexpected staining of endothelial cells observed in previous human and monkey tissue cross-reactivity studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells and that this in turn could lead to vasculitis in macaques.

The  results  of  the  new  study  demonstrated  obinutuzumab  staining  of  membrane  and  cytoplasmic elements in mononuclear leukocytes in B cell regions of lymphoid tissues, in hematopoietic cells and in individual  mononuclear  leukocytes  in  multiple  tissues  in  both  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissue panels. In addition, cytoplasmic staining with obinutuzumab was seen in endothelium, epithelium/myoepithelium,  and  platelets  in  the  human  tissue  panel.  In  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues, cytoplasmic staining was observed in endothelium, epithelium, cerebellar granular layer cells and neural processes, and skin follicular root sheaths.

According to ICH S6, binding to areas not typically accessible to the antibody in vivo i.e. cytoplasm, is generally not toxicologically relevant. This is also underscored by the MAH regarding the results from this study, and this assumption may be endorsed. Thus, the results may support that the unexpected staining of  endothelial  cells  observed  in  previous  human  and  monkey  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies,  may  not indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques.

The  mechanism  by  which  infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs)  are  triggered  is  not  clearly  understood, however, evidence suggests that IRRs may be linked to the release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators  from  immune  effector  cells  such  as  NK  cells,  macrophages/monocytes  and/or  neutrophils; potentially also from B-cells targeted by obinutuzumab. Cytokine release can occur as a consequence of the  antibody-antigen  interaction  between  obinutuzumab  and  the  CD20  antigen  on  B  lymphocytes,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resulting in Fc receptor crosslinking of FcγRIII on immune effector cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages/monocytes  and  subsequent  cytokine  release  from  these  cells.  An  in  vitro  study  was designed to explore the role of cytokine release in the increased infusion-related reactions (IRR) incidence and severity observed in obinutuzumab-treated versus rituximab-treated patients. Obinutuzumab induced stronger cytokine release, increased up-regulation of CD11b and stronger B cell depletion than rituximab and ofatumumab, when incubated with whole blood from healthy donors. These data are in alignment with  the  clinical  trial  CLL11/BO21004  in  CLL  patients  where  obinutuzumab  was  found  to  have  greater efficacy than Rituximab, albeit with more severe and increased incidence of IRR.

In accordance with the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use', EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required for all new marketing authorisation applications for a medicinal product through a centralised, mutual recognition, decentralised or national procedure, including extensions to already marketed products. In the case of products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should be provided. This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the  environment.  The  active  ingredient  in  GAZYVARO,  Obinutuzumab,  is  a  glyco-engineered  Type  II humanised  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  of  the  IgG1  subclass,  therefore  it  is  exempted.  The justification is that as a protein, Obinutuzumab is categorically exempt from the necessity of an ERA. This is agreed.

## 2.2.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical aspects of obinutuzumab are sufficiently covered in the original submission for the MA and by the updated data submitted in this application.

## Methods

## Analytical Methods

The ELISA technique for the quantification of obinutuzumab in human serum was the same as used in the original  application.  Bendamustine concentrations were measured in human Li-heparin plasma samples using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method.  Briefly,  human  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  using  deuterated bendamustine  (bendamustine-d8-HCL)  as  an  internal  standard,  and  performing  protein  precipitation. Analysis  was  performed  by  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric detection  (API  3000,  PE  Sciex)  operated  in  the  positive  ion  mode.  Separation  was  performed  on  a reversed phase (C18, 50 -2.1 mm, 3.0 μm particle size) analytical column using methanol/acetonitrile/water/formic  acid  as  the  mobile  phase.  The  retention  time  of  bendamustine  was approximately 1.15 minutes.

## PK and statistical analysis

## Obinutuzumab

PK  of  Obinutuzumab  has  been  characterized  in  earlier  development  using  basically  population-PK modelling approach.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population PK analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with software NONMEM 7.3.0. The PK data from studies BO20999, BO21000, BO21003, and BO21004 were assessed previously as this analysis was part of the documentation submitted in the CLL application.

In  this  application,  the  base  model  developed  in  the  original  report  was  used  as  a  starting  point  but refined by the inclusion of data collected in studies GAO4753g and also study GAO4915g for the current analysis. The structured model was first established then followed by the development of the covariate model.  Model  evaluation  was  performed  using  informative  graphics  and  various  predictive  check simulations.

The final population PK model was used to calculate (using Bayesian posthoc parameters) and summarize the  individual  derived  PK  parameters  (terminal  half-life  [t1/2,term],  effective  half-life  [t1/2,eff],  CLinf, central volume [V1], and volume of steady-state [VSS]). Terminal and effective half-life were computed at steady-state when time-dependent clearance has already decreased to zero [Lötsch et al. 2002].

For all patients in the analysis dataset, the individual concentration-time courses were simulated using patients' individual PK parameters estimated from the model. For each time point, median concentration and  90%  prediction  interval  were  computed  and  illustrated  graphically.  Two  dosing  regimens  were simulated: iNHL dosing regimen implemented in Study GAO4753g (1000 mg IV dosing every 4 weeks for 24 weeks, with the additional 1000 mg IV doses at days 8 and 15, and then 1000 mg every 2 months) and DLBCL dosing regimen implemented in Study GAO4915g (1000 mg IV dosing every 3 weeks for 24 weeks, with the additional 1000 mg IV doses at days 8 and 15). For important covariates, the effect of covariates  was  illustrated  by  comparison  of  concentrations  over  time  for  subsets  of  patients  with  the respective covariate values (or categories). The predicted individual exposure measures (Cmax, Ctrough, and  AUCτ  with  τ  =21,  28,  or  60  days,  depending  on  the  dosing  regimen)  at  the  last  dosing  cycle (separately for Induction and Maintenance periods for iNHL regimen) were computed and summarized by important covariates.

For  the  FL  indication  and  similarly  to  the  sensitivity  analysis  performed  for  patients  with  CLL  in  the original report, sensitivity analyses were performed for patients with iNHL, FL, or DLBCL by refitting the model  to  the  data  associated  to  those  diseases  only,  separately  for  each,  and  comparison  of  model parameters and predictions with the final model. Individual predicted PK parameters were summarized by disease types and iNHL subtypes. Individual concentrations and exposure measures were simulated for the iNHL and DLBCL dosing regimens, and summarized by disease types, iNHL subtypes, and covariates as described above.

## Bendamustine

The study included a DDI sub-study to explore the impact of obinutuzumab on the PK of bendamustine. This sub-study included 20 patients who underwent intensive PK sampling on Day 2 of Cycle 1 at the following times: pre-bendamustine infusion, immediately after the end of the infusion, and then 15, 30 and 45 minutes, and 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after the end of the bendamustine infusion. Bendamustine PK was  assessed  in  10  patients  who  received  bendamustine  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab  and  a comparison was made to bendamustine PK in 10 patients who received bendamustine alone. The impact of  bendamustine  on  obinutuzumab  PK  was  not  assessed.  Due  to  the  different  dose  regimens  for bendamustine in the 2 treatment arms, AUCinf and Cmax were dose-normalized to enable comparison.

## Brief description of the model structure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies is usually described by a two-compartment model, either linear or with target-mediated disposition. The original population PK model of obinutuzumab was a twocompartment linear model with time-dependent clearance. In this model, clearance was the sum of nonspecific  time-independent  clearance  (CLinf)  and  time-dependent  clearance  (CLt)  that  exponentially decreased with time. The base model developed in the original analysis was a starting point for the model development.  The  model  included  body-size  dependences  for  all  model  parameters  using  allometric scaling with the estimated power coefficients.

The  suitability  of  the  model  was  evaluated  using  graphical  evaluation  and  statistics  and  precision  of parameters estimates.

The full model 171imp (including all available data) was refined by the re-estimation of the model parameters using a larger dataset including all available data (see Table 1 for details on datasets). The final population PK model was used to calculate (using Bayesian posthoc parameters) for each patients the individual derived PK parameters. The data obtained are summarized below for each patients group.

The final model was refitted with only FL data (called FL model, Model 171impD6). These data included 8545 samples from 406 patients with FL. Comparison of the predictions (PRED and IPRED) and goodnessof-fit  between  the  final  and  FL  models  show  that  the  population  predictions  are  very  similar,  and individual predictions are nearly identical.

Obinutuzumab  PKs  in  FL  patients  could  be  considered  elucidated.  The  drug  exhibits  typical  'Target Mediated  Drug  Disposition'  (TMDD)  PK  behavior  of  anti-tumoural  antibodies.  The  concentration-time course of obinutuzumab is adequately described by a two-compartment PK model with non-linear timedependent clearance  and  steady-state  PK  parameters  typical  for  a  mAb.  Obinutuzumab  clearance  was described as the sum of steady-state (time-independent) clearance and time-dependent clearance that decreased exponentially with time on treatment.

The  original  population  PK  analysis  of  obinutuzumab  that  was  based  on  CLL  and  NHL  data  accurately described the PK of obinutuzumab. The parameters of the updated population PK model (model imp171 and imp171D) and the precision of their estimation, which included the data from studies GAO4753g and GAO4915g, were basically similar between the three models. Despite slight differences sensitivity analysis showed that the PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in patients with iNHL were similar to the PK findings in the combined population.

Following IV administration of bendamustine, plasma data indicated a rapid elimination with a half-life (t1/2)  of  24.6  minutes  and  28.6  minutes,  when  bendamustine  was  given  alone  and  in  combination, respectively. There were no meaningful differences observed for bendamustine AUCinf and Cmax (dosenormalized) between the 2 treatment arms (the 95% CI for the ratio of geometric means includes 1). In addition, there were no meaningful differences in bendamustine t1/2, clearance or volume of distribution between  the  2  treatment  arms.  Inter-subject  variability  was  high  with  coefficients  of  variation  (CV) ranging between 65.3-87.7% for Cmax and AUCinf (Table 9).

The DDI sub-study is insufficiently powered to allow any reliable conclusions regarding the influence of obinutuzumab co-administration on the bendamustine PKs. This is clearly illustrated by the 95% CI of Cmax  and  AUCinf  ratios  shown  above.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  the  occurrence  of  such  PK interaction is not plausible.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

N/A

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

The  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  obinutuzumab  is  depletion  of  B  cells  and  their  subsequent recovery in the peripheral blood. In all studies, a rapid depletion of B cells was observed following the first  obinutuzumab  administration,  which  was  maintained  over  the  treatment  cycles  and  follow-up. Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) for obinutuzumab and Human Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) for rituximab were evaluated in the G-Benda arm of the study.

## B- Cell depletion

In Study GAO4753g, blood samples for immunophenotyping of B-cells were only assessed in patients in the G-benda arm (N =194).

B-cell depletion was defined as CD19-positive B-cell counts &lt;0.07x10 9 /L occurring after at least one dose of obinutuzumab had been administered. Time to depletion was defined as the number of days between the first intake of obinutuzumab and the date of the first CD19-positive B-cell count of &lt;0.07x10 9 /L. The extent of  CD19 + B-cell  depletion  was  defined  as  the  lowest  absolute  counts  for  the  individual  (i.e.,  the nadir) across all visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

B-cell  recovery  was  defined  as  a  CD19-positive  B-cell  count  &gt;0.07x10 9 /L,  in  a  patient  whose  previous CD19-positive  B-cell  count  measurement  revealed  B-cell  depletion.  B-cell  recovery  was  considered possible only after the patient had completed study treatment.

The time to B-cell recovery was defined as the time from B-cell depletion until B-cell recovery.

Of the 121 patients who had a CD19-positive B-cell result, 116 (96%) patients had B-cell depletion at the last obinutuzumab administration. B-cell recovery could not be assessed because of the low number of patients  who  have  been  followed  for  a  sufficient  length  of  time.  At  6-12  months  after  the  last obinutuzumab administration, only 26 patients had a B-cell assessment, and the B-cells had recovered in 1 of the 26 patients. Very few patients were available for B-cell assessment after 12 months. Considering only patients with documented recovery at the time of the data cutoff, the median time from the last antibody administration (LAA) to B-cell recovery was 660 days (~1.8 years) (range: 1- 746 days).

In  study  GAO4753g  immunophenotyping  of  B-cells  was  performed  in  G-benda  arm  patients  only.  As bendamustine is expected to cause T-cell suppression, immunophenotyping of B-cells was not performed in the benda arm of the GAO4753g study.

## Immunogenicity

## HAHA (anti obinutuzumab antibody)

Among the 175 patients validly tested for HAHA at baseline (day-1, cycle-1) two patients were positive, in the G-benda arm (both at 1:10 titre) and both patients had an IRR the same day.

No patients had a positive HAHA result for anti-obinutuzumab antibodies after Cycle 1, Day 1.

The observed concentration time courses for the one patient with HAHA who continued to receive study treatment was similar to that of patients without detected HAHA.

The occurrence of HAHA evidenced in study GAO4753g (2 patients among 175) is unexpectedly much lower than that observed in study BO21004 (17 patients among 286).

## HACA: (Anti-rituxumab antibodies)

As all patients participating in the trial had previously been exposed to rituximab, human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA) for rituximab were also assessed. At baseline, 13 patients (7.4%) in the G-benda arm had  a  positive  HACA  result,  including  one  of  the  patients  described  above.  Two  of  these  patients experienced Grade 3-4 IRRs on Cycle 1, Day 1.

13 patients (7.4%) were positive for HACA. Among them, 2 patients experienced grade 3-4 IRRs. The current EU SmPC includes the appropriate special warning and precautions with regards to IRR risk as well  as  the  appropriate  recommendations  for  dosing,  premedication,  prophylaxis  monitoring  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

management of patients experiencing  IRRs.  Therefore,  no  additional  prophylaxis  and  premedication  is proposed.

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

## Exposure-Efficacy relationships

An attempt to characterize the exposure-Efficacy relationship in the pivotal GAO4753g study was made in the population PK analysis detailed above. The analyses, similar to the analysis performed for patients with CLL in study BO21004, were conducted separately for iNHL patients from Study GAO4753g and for DLBCL patients from Study GAO4915g. The objectives of the graphical analysis of the exposure-efficacy relationships of obinutuzumab for patients with iNHL (Study GAO4753g) were:

- -To assess the relationships between the drug exposure and efficacy measures such as BOR, PFS, and OS and
- -To assess the relationships between the drug exposure and pharmacodynamics parameters of the drug effect such as the observed tumour size and B-cell counts.

## Exposure - efficacy relationships

There was high variability in time of achieving the complete response (CR), and median time to CR was close to 200 days. Median Cmean appeared to be higher in subjects with CR, compared to subjects in other response groups, both overall and in subjects with low baseline tumour size.

For PFS, subjects with events had a slightly lower median Cmean compared to subjects without events, overall  and  for  subjects  with  high  baseline  tumour  size;  the  distributions  of  Cmean  were  similar  for subjects with low baseline tumour size. Among subjects with events, there were no differences in event times for subjects in different exposure tertiles (Figure 3). Kaplan-Meier plots (Figure 4) suggested that PFS was similar in medium and high exposure groups, and was lower in the low tertile of exposure. The effect  was  mostly  due  to  the  lower  survival  in  the  lowest  exposure  category  for  patients  with  high baseline tumour size.

For progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patients in higher exposure categories (medium and high tertiles of exposure) had longer survival compared to patients in lowest exposure tertile; the effect was mostly due to shorter survival in the lowest exposure tertile in patients with high baseline tumour size (figures 5 &amp; 6).

Tumour size reduction compared to baseline was slightly greater in patients showing higher obinutuzumab exposure (80%, 85%, and 90% in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertiles, respectively) (figure 7); however  this  result  is  confounded  with  slightly  higher  baseline  tumour  size  in  the  lower  categories  of exposure.

Patients  with  complete  response  appeared  to  have  higher  exposure  compared  to  patients  in  other response categories, overall and in patients with low (below median value) baseline tumour size.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finding of a potential trend of increased efficacy parameters (change of tumour size, BOR, and PFS) in the medium and high exposure groups is similar to the results of the previous analysis for patients with CLL. It is important to note that for both iNHL and CLL patients this trend was observed for relationships unadjusted for key baseline prognostic factors. Thus, it could be due to potential confounding of exposure and prognosis of patients. The performed graphical analysis stratified patients only by baseline tumour size and not by other prognostic factors. This could represent a limitation of the methodology used in the analysis.

Similar graphical Exposure-Efficacy analyses have been conducted for the subpopulation of patients with FL in the GAO4753g study.

As seen in the overall population of patients with iNHL, the efficacy (PFS) of obinutuzumab-containing therapy in patients with FL appeared to be greater in patients with highest exposure to obinutuzumab than in patients with lower exposure to obinutuzumab. This finding was consistent with expectations since patients with FL made up the majority (almost 90%) of patients in the iNHL population in the GAO4753g study  which  were  included  in  the  exposure-PFS  analysis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  those  ExposureEfficacy  graphical  analyses  were  not  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  at  baseline  other  than  baseline tumour size . Therefore, the apparent association between higher exposure to obinutuzumab and better PFS could be due to confounding factors, such as differences in tumour burden, body weight, and other baseline demographic and prognostic factors. Further analyses of PFS/OS and exposure in patients with FL  (i.e.,  Cox  regression  analyses),  has  been  conducted.  Overall  the  results  of  the  exposure  efficacy analyses in the FL population are consistent with the ones obtained in the iNHL population.

## Exposure-Safety relationships

Exposure-safety  relationship  has  been  extensively  investigated  using  the  population-PK  modelled analysis. Data from all patients enrolled in the G-benda arm receiving at least one dose has included in the  analysis.  No  clear  relationship  between  exposure  level  and  the  occurrence  of  any  SAE  has  been evidenced.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Obinutuzumab exhibits typical 'Target Mediated Drug Disposition' (TMDD) PK behavior of anti-tumoural antibodies. The concentration-time course of obinutuzumab  is adequately described by a  twocompartment PK model with non-linear time-dependent clearance and steady-state PK parameters typical for  a  mAb.  Obinutuzumab  clearance  was  described  as  the  sum  of  steady-state  (time-independent) clearance and time-dependent clearance that decreased exponentially with time on treatment.

The  original  population  PK  analysis  of  obinutuzumab  that  was  based  on  CLL  and  NHL  data  accurately described the PK of obinutuzumab. The parameters of the updated population PK model (model imp171 and imp171D) and the precision of their estimation, which included the data from studies GAO4753g and GAO4915g, were similar between the three models. Despite slight differences sensitivity analysis showed that the PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in patients with iNHL were similar to the PK findings in the combined population.

Interference  with  other  co-administered  medication  has  been  tested  in  the  intitial  submission.  No significant interference of these medications (chlorambucil, bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine doxorubicine, and fludarabine) with the method performances has been detected. The DDI sub-study included in this submission is insufficiently powered to allow any reliable conclusion regarding  the  influence  of  obinutuzumab  co-administration  on  the  bendamustine  PKs.  This  is  clearly illustrated by the 95% CI of Cmax and AUCinf ratios shown above. However, it is recognized that the occurrence of such PK interaction is not plausible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Occurrence of HAHA in the GAO4753g study is low, however it is medically/scientifically plausible that the lower incidence of HAHA could be due to the fact that these patients had all been heavily treated with immunosuppressive  medication  or  to  inherent  differences  between  iNHL  and  CLL  in  immunological reactivity. However, it is also possible that the difference in incidence of HAHAs with the supportive study is  simply  due  to  differences  in  the  frequency  and  timing  of  HAHA  sampling  relative  to  completion  of obinutuzumab  therapy,  and  to  the  difference  in  number  of  patients  sampled  post-obinutuzumab treatment.  Data  to  date  do  not  suggest  a  correlation  between  HAHAs  and  disease  progression  in  the GAO4753g study but these data need to be interpreted with care because most patients progressed on or soon after receiving obinutuzumab, and detection of HAHAs may be unreliable in this context.

As seen in the overall population of patients with iNHL, the efficacy (PFS) of obinutuzumab-containing therapy in patients with FL appeared to be greater in patients with highest exposure to obinutuzumab than in patients with lower exposure to obinutuzumab. This finding was consistent with expectations since patients with FL made up the majority (almost 90%) of patients in the iNHL population in the GAO4753g study  which  were  included  in  the  exposure-PFS  analysis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  those  ExposureEfficacy  graphical  analyses  were  not  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  at  baseline  other  than  baseline tumour size . Therefore, the apparent association between higher exposure to obinutuzumab and better PFS could be due to confounding factors, such as differences in tumour burden, body weight, and other baseline demographic and prognostic factors. Further analyses of PFS/OS and exposure in patients with FL  (i.e.,  Cox  regression  analyses)  conducted  and  are  consistent  with  the  ones  obtained  in  the  iNHL population.  No  clear  relationship  between  exposure  level  and  the  occurrence  of  any  SAE  has  been evidenced.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Obinutuzumab pharmacokinetics in FL patients could be considered elucidated and in line with the knowledge of obinutuzumab PK in CLL.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response studies

No dose response study was submitted. The obinutuzumab dose selection was based on safety, efficacy and PK data in phase I studies (BO20999/BO21003), which indicated that an obinutuzumab dose of 1000 mg was the dose most likely to be well tolerated and efficacious in a majority of NHL patients regardless of their initial tumour burden. PK modelling also suggested that additional doses of obinutuzumab on day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and then every 2 months beyond 6 months were needed in patients with iNHL to saturate target-mediated clearance thought to be indicative of clearance of CD19+ cells, and achieve and maintain a steady state of drug levels early, and throughout treatment (Gibarsky et al. 2014).

The  preliminary  data  from  phase  I/II  monotherapy  studies  showed  a  favourable  safe  profile  of obinutuzumab treatment beyond 6 months to improve the clinical outcomes of patients otherwise treated with bendamustine alone. The dose of bendamustine was given according to the recommendations of the consensus  conference  for  relapsed/refractory  iNHL  patients  for  bendamustine  monotherapy  and  in combination with rituximab (Cheson et al. 2010).

## Treatments

A total of 413 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the two study treatment arms to receive bendamustine alone (benda arm) or obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine (G-benda arm).

Figure 1. Overview of study design

<!-- image -->

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate clinical benefit in terms of PFS, as assessed by an Independent Radiology Facility (IRF), for obinutuzumab when used in combination with bendamustine compared with bendamustine alone in patients with indolent NHL refractory to prior rituximab-containing therapy.

The secondary objectives were:

- To compare PFS as assessed by the investigator
- To compare OS between study arms
- To evaluate in each study arm and compare between study arms the following:
1. ORR (rate of CR + PR) and CR rate at the study treatment completion/early study treatment termination visit;
2. Best ORR achieved during treatment or within 12 months of the start of treatment;
3. DFS in CR patients;
4. Duration of response (DoR) in patients with CR and PR
- To compare EFS between the two study arms
- To evaluate and compare the safety profiles of patients treated with the combination of bendamustine + obinutuzumab and bendamustine alone
- To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine and evaluate for drug-drug interactions by comparing the pharmacokinetics of the combination with the PK of bendamustine alone.
- To analyze pharmacoeconomics (medical resource utilization) in both arms of the study
- To assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in both treatment arms

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progression or relapse as assessed by an IRC according to the modified response criteria for NHL (Cheson et al, 2007), or to death from any cause.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary efficacy endpoints were:

- PFS as assessed by investigator

- Best overall response (BOR) and best response of CR during treatment and up to 12 months after the start of treatment, as assessed by the IRC and by the investigator

- Complete response (CR) and overall response (CR or PR) rate at the end-of-induction (EOI)/early study treatment termination visit, as assessed by the IRC and by the investigator

- OS, defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. Patients who were not reported as having died at the time of the analysis were censored at the date when they were last known to be alive, as documented by the investigator.

- Disease-free survival (DFS), defined for patients with a best overall response of CR, as the time from the first occurrence of a documented CR, as assessed by the IRC, until relapse defined on the basis of the IRC assessments or death from any cause on study.

- Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from a best overall response of CR or PR to the first occurrence of progression/relapse (based on the IRC assessment) or death from any cause on study.

- Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression/relapse based on IRC assessments, death from any cause on study, or start of a new anti-lymphoma therapy (NALT).

- Medical resource utilization, which included the number of hospitalizations related to AEs (as captured in the electronic Case Report Form [eCRF] SAE section), types of subsequent drug therapies, and medical and surgical procedures (i.e., blood transfusions, bone marrow transplantation, or stem-cell transplantation). Analysis of data on medical resource utilization will be summarized in a separate report.

- Change in health-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from baseline, by visit, as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) instrument.

- EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Health Index Scale summary scores at baseline, during treatment, and following treatment discontinuation or completion (both progression-free and after disease progression)

## Sample size

Estimates of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to PFS are based upon the hypothesis with use of a two-sided stratified log-rank test at an overall 5% significance level. Twosided level 0.05 log-rank test, 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of G-benda versus benda alone of 0.70 corresponding to a 43% improvement in median PFS from 9.3 to 13.3 months.

Two interim analyses of PFS were performed, one for futility when approximately 34% of PFS events had occurred  and  another  for  efficacy  and  futility  when  approximately  65%  of  the  total  PFS  events  had occurred (interim boundary is described in the study protocol). The futility boundary was non-binding with respect  to  the  overall  type  I  error  and  no  adjustment  was  made  for  the  early  20-patient,  safety-only interim analysis.

Efficacy boundaries for PFS were computed with the use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O'BrienFleming  boundary  shape.  The  futility  boundary  was  chosen  so  that  a  95%  confidence  interval  (CI) excluded the alternative hazard ratio of 0.7 when the observed monitoring statistic matched the futility boundary exactly.

Thereby a total of 260 PFS events, as assessed by the IRC were required for the final analysis of the trial.

With an initial accrual rate of 8.5 patients per month, and a 9-month ramp-up, then reducing to a revised assumed accrual rate after 44 months of 5 patients per month and 5% loss to follow-up per year, 410

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients enrolled over 54 months and followed for an additional 23 months were required to observe 260 IRC-assessed PFS events, with a total duration of approximately 77 months. For OS, under the assumption of a hazard ratio of 0.73, a total of approximately 96 months (i.e., 3.5 years after the last patient enrollment) were required to observe 226 deaths for 55%-65% power.

## Randomisation

Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the benda alone or G-benda arm at a ratio of 1:1 using the dynamic allocation method, based on the following stratification factors:

1. Indolent NHL subtype (follicular versus other)
2. Refractory type (rituximab monotherapy vs. rituximab + chemotherapy)
3. Number of prior therapies (≤2 vs. &gt;2)
4. Geographic region.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

The IDMC was responsible for reviewing the data at pre-specified timepoints per the statistical plan, while the Sponsor remained blinded to treatment arm allocation of the study data.

## Statistical methods

PFS for patients without disease progression or death was censored at the time of the last IRC tumour assessment. If no IRC tumour assessments were performed after the baseline visit, PFS was censored at the time of randomization plus 1 day.

A two-sided stratified Log-Rank test at an overall 5% significance level was done to confirm the primary analysis. Estimates of the treatment effect are expressed as hazard ratios, estimated with the use of a stratified Cox model, including 95% confidence limits. Median PFS and the 95% confidence limits were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology using Greenwood's formula. An unstratified log-rank test was also performed as a sensitivity analysis.

Response  rates  were  compared  using  a  chi-square  test.  In  addition,  95%  confidence  limits  for  the difference were calculated using Cochran-Mantel Haenszel.

To control the overall type 1 error rate at two-sided 5%, the fixed sequence testing procedure (Westfall and Krishen, 2001) was used to adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. If the primary endpoint was positive, the key secondary endpoints were to be tested in the following order:

- -PFS as assessed by the investigator
- -BOR within 12 months of start of treatment as assessed by the IRC
- -Best response of CR within 12 months of start of treatment as assessed by the IRC
- -OS

Disease  response  measures  (BOR,  CR  and  overall  response  rates)  were  compared  between  the  two treatment arms using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.

Patients with no response assessments (for whatever reason) were considered non-responders. A nonstratified analysis calculating a X 2 test result is provided as a sensitivity analysis. In addition, response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rates and 95% confidence limits are given for each treatment group, and 95% confidence limits for the difference are calculated.

Analysis  methods  for  OS  and  other  time-to-event  analyses  were  the  same  as  those  described  for  the primary  efficacy.  At  the  time  of  the  primary  analysis,  an  interim  OS  analysis  was  performed.  Group sequential methods with the use of alpha-spending function with an O'Brien-Fleming boundary were used to control the type I error at the 0.05 level. A final OS analysis will take place after approximately 226 deaths have occurred.

data cut-off was 1 September 2014. The applicant submitted updated results with a cut-off date of 1 May 2015.

## Conduct of the study

Main protocol amendments were:

In version 2 the bendamustine control arm regimen was modified from 90 mg/m2 to 120 mg/m2 - given on days 1 and 2 of a 28 day cycle; rituximab refractoriness was more clearly defined in the inclusion criteria. In version 3 exclusion criteria were modified to also exclude patients who had received bendamustine; rituximab - refractory iNHL was clarified to mean any prior line and not just the most recent; an early interim analysis for futility was added; the analysis of the FACT-Lym questionnaire was modified to capture changes in HRQoL based on minimally important differences. In Version 4 a number of changes were made to the eligibility criteria, clarifying parameters. In version 5 eligibility criteria were modified to allow the enrolment of patients previously treated with a bendamustine - containing regimen to reflect clinical practice. A country- specific amendment was made in version 6 to exclude patients with a history of PML; revised information about PML was included in version 7. In version 8 the protocol was amended to allow for an increase in the number of patients enrolled from 360 to 410 and to extend AE reporting period in the comparator arm; revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma were amended in appendix E.

Protocol violations occured by the cut-off of 1st September 2014 are listed in table 3

## Patient reported quality of Life

Patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status, as captured by the FACT-Lym and EQ-5D health index questionnaires, respectively, showed no overall difference between the benda and G-benda arms over time for the entire iNHL population during the treatment and follow-up periods. Time to deterioration of FACT-Lym TOI score, defined as ≥ 6-point worsening from baseline, was delayed in  the  G-benda arm (median: 8.0 months) compared with the benda arm (median: 4.6 months (HR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98).

In  addition,  median  time to  worsening of  patient-reported  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  (  &gt;  6 points on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Lym TOI) was numerically longer in the G-benda arm than in the benda arm (8.0 vs. 4.6 months) in the iNHL (ITT) population. In addition, higher proportions of patients in the G-benda arm had an improvement in their FACT-Lym questionnaire scores during treatment and throughout follow-up.

## Efficacy in the non-FL population

The results of Independent Review committee (IRC)- assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the nonFL  population  showed  a  limited  treatment  effect  of  G-benda  compared  to  benda  (hazard  ratio  [HR]  = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.90).

The population in the BO21000 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for the registration. Indeed, part 1 of the study investigated obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapies different from G-benda and part 2 of the study included previously untreated FL patients; not  in  line  with  the  applied  indication.  In  addition,  Study  BO21000  also  used  different  doses  of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (400mg, 800mg and 1600mg) whereas 1000 mg was used in GAO4753g. Study BO21000 used a different maintenance regimen of obinutuzumab (1000 mg every 3 months for 2 years compared with 1000 mg every 2 months for 2 years in Study GAO4753g).

In the supporting study BO21000, patients were only eligible for the maintenance phase (part 2) if they had achieved a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR) during induction therapy. In the pivotal Study GAO4753g, patients without disease progression at the end of  induction  (i.e.,  patients  with  a  CR,  PR  or  stable  disease  [SD])  were  eligible  for  maintenance obinutuzumab.

## Study BO21003

Study  BO21003  (GAUSS)  is  an  open-label  dose-escalating  Phase  I/randomized  Phase  II  study  of obinutuzumab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20+ malignant disease.

For the Phase I dose-escalation part of the study, all patients with CD20+ malignant disease (NHL or CLL) were eligible if no therapy of higher priority was available and treatment with an anti-CD20+ antibody was deemed appropriate.

The population in the BO21003 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for the registration (patients NHL or CCL versus FL). However, in part 2 of the study BO21003, the study population was iNHL patients and the primary endpoint was based on patients with FL only. However, the compared study treatments were different from the GAO4753g study (obinutuzumab vs. rituximab given as  monotherapy  in  the  BO21003  study);  study  doses  ranging  from  100  mg  -  2000  mg  were  given whereas the GAO4753g study used 1000 mg for all doses; The dosing schedule was weekly dosing during induction compared with the GAO4753g study (28-day cycles during induction). In the supporting study BO21003,  patients  were  only  eligible  for  the  maintenance  phase  if  they  had  achieved  a  complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR) during induction therapy; Phase  I  patients  with  SD  were  also  eligible  for  maintenance  if  they  were  considered  to  have  derived clinical  benefit  from induction. In the pivotal Study GAO4753g, patients without disease progression at the end of induction (i.e., patients with a CR, PR or stable disease [SD]) were eligible for maintenance obinutuzumab.

## Study 20999

Study  BO20999  (GAUGUIN)  is  an  open-label  dose-escalating  Phase  I/randomized  Phase  II  study  of obinutuzumab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive (CD20+) malignancies.

The Phase II part of the study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of the recommended doses identified in Phase I part of the study, in patients with CD20+ relapsed/refractory iNHL, aNHL and CLL, in order  to  obtain  further  safety  information  at  these  doses  and  early  efficacy  data  in  the  three  patient populations.

In this part of the study, patients with NHL were randomized to receive either high dose (1600 mg [Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 8]/800 mg [all other doses]) or low dose (400 mg) obinutuzumab.

a Four randomized patients did not receive any study medication (bendamustine); three patients withdrew consent and one patient was withdrawn due to physician's decision.

b Rituximab data not included. For Study BO21003, only data for patients with FL in the obinutuzumab arm are included. ** The primary endpoint of this part of the study was safety.

aNHL = aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma; benda = bendamustine; CLL = chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; CR = complete response; CRu = unconfirmed complete response; CSR = clinical study report; FL = follicular lymphoma; G = obinutuzumab; G-benda = obinutuzumab + bendamustine; G-CHOP = obinutuzumab + CHOP; G-FC = obinutuzumab + fludarabine, cyclophosphamide; NHL = non-Hodgkin lymphoma; ORR = overall response rate; PR = partial response; R = rituximab.

The population in the BO20999 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for the registration (patients CCL/NHL). The study BO20999 investigated different doses of obinutuzumab as monotherapy (50 mg-2000 mg), whereas Study GAO4753g only investigated obinutuzumab 1000 mg. The dosing schedule was also different in the BO20999 study (21-day cycles during induction) compared with the GAO4753g study (28-day cycles during induction).

All  the  supportive  studies  included  adult  (male  or  female)  patients  with  CD20+  disease based on local testing followed by central confirmation.

Patients in the supporting studies were assessed for disease response by the investigator using regular clinical and laboratory examinations, and CT scans, according to standard response criteria (Cheson et al. 1999 and 2007). In the Phase II part of Study BO21003, responses at the end of induction were also assessed by an IRC, and the primary endpoint was based on patients with FL only.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The indication is based on the results of pivotal study GAO4753g investigating the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab  plus  bendamustine  (G-benda)  compared  with  bendamustine  (benda)  in  patients  with rituximab-refractory, iNHL those patients who had no response to or who progressed within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

GAO4753g was an open-label, randomized phase III study submitted to support the application for an extension of the indication of adding obinutuzumab to bendamustine in patients with iNHL after failure of rituximab-based therapy. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of up to 2.5 years of obinutuzumab initially in combination with 6 cycles of bendamustine, compared with bendamustine alone (6 cycles). The rationale  of  continued  obinutuzumab  in  the  maintenance  phase  was  based  on  results  with  rituximab maintenance up to 2 years after induction therapy, which had shown to improve the outcomes of patients with follicular lymphoma in both first line and relapsed/refractory setting (van Oers et al. 2010, Salles et al. 2011, Vidal et al. 2011). Based on clinical and non-clinical data, Obinutuzumab was expected to have superior efficacy with similar safety to rituximab.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive bendamustine 90 mg/m2 day 1 and 2 in cycles 1-6 and obinutuzumab 1000 mg day 1, 8 and 15 in cycle 1, day 1 in cycles 2-6 and as maintenance q2 monthly for  up  to  2  years  or  bendamustine  as  single  agent  120  mg/m2  day  1  and  2  in  cycles  1-6.  Dynamic allocation was used for randomisation which could affect the interpretation of the robustness of presented efficacy data.  However, the use of this method has been adequately justified by the applicant.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was PFS, which is considered acceptable in this phase III trial. Secondary endpoints were: OS, tumour response (response rate and duration of response, disease free survival (DFS)) and HRQoL based on assessment of various subscales according to functional assessment of cancer therapy for patients with lymphoma. Median PFS expected in the protocol were 9.3 months and 13.3 months respectively in the control and Gazyvaro group. The study was open-label, allowing potential subjective bias to be introduced. However, all the evaluations of endpoints were performed by a blinded independent review committee. The assessment by the investigators was considered supportive.

Different subgroups were analysed: histology including grade, gender, age, prognostic index and clinical stage,  response  to  prior  therapy,  genotype.  Except  from  the  follicular  lymphomas,  the  majority  of subgroups were too small to draw any significant conclusion.

A total of 413 patients were included. In general the demographics and baseline data were well balanced between  the  two  treatment  arms  both  in  the  iNHL  population  and  the  FL  subpopulation.  Overall  the majority of patients were male, Caucasian and less than 70 years of age, median age was 63.0 years (range  21  to  87  years).  The  disease  and  disease  prognostic  factors  characteristics  were  also  quite comparable in the two treatment arms, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients in the Gbenda  arm  than  in  the  benda  arm  with  extranodal  involvement  (55.4%  vs.  49.5%),  indicating  more advanced disease. Almost all patients were refractory to rituximab as required by the entry criteria of the protocol, 81. 3% in the benda arm and 77.5% in the G-benda arm were considered 'double refractory', i.e. also refractory to an alkylating agent.

The applicant has submitted information regarding 3 additional studies, one phase IB study (Bo21000) and two phase I/II studies (BO20999 and BO21003).There were major limitations for all 3 studies, they were small, and obinutuzumab was given as monotherapy or together with CHOP, FC. In one small study obinutuzumab was given together with bendamustine; however this was in patients on first-line therapy for follicular lymphoma. Thus, no clinical support from these applications was noted.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The included patients appear to represent the target population.

The pivotal study GA04753g met its primary endpoint after 67% of events required for the final analysis had been observed: treatment with G-benda resulted in a statistically significant reduction by 47% in the risk of IRC-assessed PFS compared with benda alone (HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.70; log-rank p-value = 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS (IRC) was 14.1 months   (95% CI: 11.7, 16.6) in the benda arm, compared to 29.2months (95% CI: 20.5, NE) (HR 0.52 (0.40, 0.70), p&lt; 0.0001) an increase of 15 months, and these results were - consistent with the primary analysis. The median OS could not be estimated in either treatment arms in the primary or updated analysis.

The  best  overall  response  rates  (CR/PR)  and  CR  rates,  as  assessed  by  the  IRC  were  not  statistically different  between  treatment  arms.  Investigator-assessed  results  were  in  agreement.    An  exploratory analysis of MRD in blood at the end of induction in the FL patients was performed. In the G-benda arm 82.4% were MRD negative vs. 42.9% in the benda arm (p&lt;0.0001, Chi-squared). These results however should be interpreted with caution due to a small population evaluated.

The duration of response (DoR) and DFS were longer in the G-benda arm (median not reached) compared with the benda arm (median 11.9 months for DoR and 13.0 months for DFS). Hazard ratios were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.54) for DoR and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.44) for DFS. EFS was longer in the G-benda arm compared with the benda arm (median: 28.3 months vs. 11.8 months) (HR: 0.52; 95% CI:0.38, 0.71, p-value &lt; 0.0001, stratified log-rank test). Overall, the results of the IRC-assessed PFS subgroup analyses  in  FL  patients  were  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  overall  ITT  (iNHL)  population.  A  trend towards a smaller benefit was observed for patients with &gt;2 prior therapies (n= 66; HR= 0.82, 95% CI: 0.39,1.72) with the upper 95% CI limit crossing 1.

In  the  subgroup of patients with FL, which comprised 81.1% of the iNHL study population, the results were similar. The HR for IRC-assessed PFS was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.68, p-value =0.0001, stratified log-rank test). PFS as assessed by the Investigator confirmed the IRC-assessed PFS results (HR =0.48; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.67, p-value &lt; 0.0001, stratified log-rank test). The median investigator assessed PFS in the G-benda arm (29.2 months [95% CI: 17.5; NE]) was over twice as long as that in the benda arm (13.7 months [95% CI: 11.0; 15.5]).

Regarding the geographical stratification factor, there is a heterogeneity in the PFS responses for both IRC and investigator assessment levels in the ITT population: HR=0,92 95%CI (0,43 - 2,00) in Eastern Europe population (perhaps linked to low number of analyzed patients), HR=0,35 95%CI (0,21 - 0,58) in the North America patients and HR=0,68 95%CI (0,44 - 1,05) in the Western Europe patients. These results were confirmed in FL patients.

The updated OS data show that the median OS has not been reached yet, but fewer patients with FL had died in the G-benda arm (30/164 [18.3%]) compared to the benda arm (48/171 [28.1%]).

Patient reported outcomes (FACT-Lym questionnaire and EQ-5D index scale) during the treatment and follow-up  periods,  showed  that  health-related  quality  of  life  was  generally  maintained.  The  addition  of obinutuzumab to bendamustine delayed the time to worsening of quality of life as measured by the FACTLym TOI score (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98). However, these results could have been biased by the open-label design of the study.

The majority of patients completed treatment as planned. The proportion of patients who received 90% of their planned obinutuzumab doses during induction was high (90.2%).

In the Maintenance Phase, almost all patients (97.2%) received &gt;90% of planned obinutuzumab during their time on treatment. The proportion of patients who withdrew from all study medication due to an AE was higher in the benda arm (15.7% of patients) than in the G-benda arm (11.3% of patients).

Since  non-FL  iNHLs  express  CD20  and  are  known  to  respond  to  rituximab  (Kiesewetter  et  al.  2015;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bennett and Schechter 2010), it is biologically plausible that obinutuzumab will have efficacy in non-FL iNHL,  as  well  as  FL.  The  Study  BO21004/CLL-11  established  the  superiority  of  obinutuzumab  + chlorambucil (G-Clb) versus rituximab + chlorambucil (R-Clb) in patients with CLL (Report No. 1056550). Because  CLL  and  SLL  are  considered  different  manifestations  of  the  same  disease  entity  (Sun  and Weistner 2015), the efficacy of obinutuzumab-based therapy has effectively already been shown for one subtype  of  non-FL.  The  results  of  Independent  Review  committee  (IRC)-  assessed  progression-free survival (PFS) in the non-FL population showed a limited treatment effect of G-benda compared to benda (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.90). This result need to be interpreted in light of the small patient numbers with non-FL and the small number of patients who had had an event at the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis.

In  the  light  of  the  above  results  the  indication  for  obinutuzumab  is  focusing  on  patients  with  FL.  A statement  has  been  included  in  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  'In  the  non-FL  population  the  HR  for  IRCassessed PFS was 0.94 [95% CI: 0.49, 1.90]. No definitive conclusions could be drawn on efficacy in the MZL  and  SLL  sub-populations.'  A  randomized  Phase III trial  -  BO21223  (GALLIUM)  (in  which chemotherapy-naïve  patients  are  randomized  to  G-chemo  followed  by  G  maintenance  vs.  R-chemo followed  by  R  maintenance)  includes  approximately  200  patients  with  advanced  MZL  and  is  currently ongoing.

Data from the supportive studies presented were not pooled because of differences in treatment regimens used  and  patient  population  enrolled  and  for  these  reasons  they  would  mainly  be  considered  as supportive of the efficacy for the present application. Indeed, the population treated by G-benda in the study B021000 is a first-line treated population, not in line with the applied indication.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The efficacy results showed a clinically significant and statistically robust improvement in PFS supporting the  indication  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  bendamustine  followed  by  maintenance  for  the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond to or who progressed during or up to 6  months  after  treatment  with  rituximab  or  a  rituximab-containing  regimen.  OS  data  were  currently immature; . Final OS analysis is expected at study Completion (See RMP).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Safety data for obinutuzumab in patients with iNHL are primarily derived from the pivotal phase III study GA04753g. The applicant also reports safety data from supporting studies: BO21000: Phase 1 study with 137 FL patients, BO21003-Phase I/II study 186 patients (100 patients with iNHL [Phase I and II] were exposed  to  obinutuzumab,  86  patients  with  iNHL  [Phase  II]  were  exposed  to  rituximab  [Rituxan, MabThera]) and BO20999 Phase I/II study with 56 patients. Safety data from the pivotal and supporting studies were not pooled, because of key differences in the study design, patient population and treatment regimens.

## Patient exposure in pivotal study GAO4753g

Clinical safety data are available for a total of 409 patients. At the time of the clinical cutoff date 154 of 204 (75.5%) patients enrolled in the G-benda arm started the Maintenance Phase and 29 patients were still receiving maintenance treatment; therefore, the Follow-Up period after the completion of maintenance was relatively short and there is limited long-term Follow-Up data available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  safety  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  received  any  amount  of  obinutuzumab  or bendamustine  therapy.  In  the  induction  phase,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  received  all  planned infusions  of  bendamustine  was  71.7%  in  the  benda  arm  and  78.3%  in  the  G-benda  arm  (median  12 doses over 170 days in both arms).

The  majority  of  patients  received  &gt;90%  of  the  planned  dose  of  study  medication  for  their  time  on treatment.  Given  the  differing  planned  doses  of  bendamustine  between  treatment  arms,  the  median cumulative dose of bendamustine during induction was higher in the benda arm (2347 mg) than in the Gbenda arm (1920 mg). The most common reason for dose modification of benda was AE.

In the G-benda arm 81.9% of patients received all scheduled cycles of their planned obinutuzumab dose. A total of 22.2% of patients had an infusion modification of obinutuzumab during the induction phase, mostly in cycle 1 (19.6% of patients) and due to AE. Almost all patients 89.7%received &gt; 90% of the planned obinutuzumab dose intensity.

Commonly affected SOCs in which the incidence of all grade individual AEs was higher (&gt;5%) in the Gbenda arm than in the benda arm, included: neutropenia, fatigue, pyrexia, asthenia, upper respiratory tract infections and coughing, IRR, arthralgia, pruritus and hypotension.

GI AEs were more common in the benda arm (82.3% vs. 74.7%) mainly due to: nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  was  also  higher  in  the  benda  arm,  probably  due  to  the higher dose of bendamustine.  All these adverse events are well known for the two substances and in this patient  population.  The  AEs  are  manageable,  and  AE  due  to  IRRs  should  be  managed  by  prophylactic treatment in an appropriate clinical setting.

As for AE incidence by age group, ie. &lt; 65,  65-75 and  75-85 and &gt;85 years, the difference between the treatment arms in terms of AE incidence in G-benda arm did not increase with older age.

The adverse events including the serious AEs are well known for the two substances and in this patient population. The most common serious AEs were reported in the blood and lymphatic system, (5.6% of the patients in the benda arm and 10.3% in the G-benda arm)   and infections (15.6% in the benda arm and 16.4% in the G-benda arm). Number of patients in the different AE groups were small. The main difference between the two treatment arms was reported in neutropenia which occurred in 3.1% in the Gbenda arm compared with 0.5% in the benda arm. However no difference was reported in number of febrile neutropenia or number of 'infections and infestations' between the two treatment arms, the AEs seems manageable and are therefore not of major concern.

## Other adverse events of special interests (AESI)

All  grade  events  of  IRRs,  neutropenia,  thrombopenia,  infection,  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  GI perforation, cardiac events, second malignancy and hepatitis B reactivation were identified as AESI.

## IRR

IRRs were AEs related to any study medication, which occurred during infusion or within 24 h from the end of infusion. The majority of IRRs were grade 1 or 2 and most IRRs resolved after treatment, no fatal IRRs was noted in this study. The incidence of IRRs was higher in the G-benda arm (68.6%) compared

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with the benda arm (63.1%), as was the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 IRRs, serious IRRs, IRRs leading to withdrawal from treatment or dose reductions/- interruptions. 36.9% of patients in the benda arm and 77.8% in the G-benda arm received prophylactic corticosteroids. In these patients, the incidence of IRR was  13.7%  in  the  benda  arm,  and  32.5%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  In  those  who  did  not  receive premedication, the incidence of IRRs was 24.0% and 55.8 respectively.

IRRs  led  to  interruption  of  bendamustine  in  13/198  (6.6%)  of  patients  in  the  benda  arm  and  11/194 (5.7%) of patients in the G-benda arm. Few patients required dose reduction (2 patients in each arm) or withdrawal (3 patients vs. 1 patient) of bendamustine due to IRR. The incidence of IRRs was higher in the first cycle and decreased in the following cycles.

In  total,  110/194  (56.7%)  patients  had  AEs  related  to  obinutuzumab  infusions.  The  Obinutuzumab infusion  was  interrupted  in  45/194  (23.2%)  patients,  most  of  whom  went  on  to  receive  the  full  dose, while  only  5  (2.6%)  patients  did  not  receive  the  full  infusion  and  4  (2.1%)  patients  discontinued obinutuzumab. In the maintenance period IRRs were observed in 8.4% of the patients, obinutuzumab had to be discontinued in 1.4% of the patients.

Guidance  for  prophylaxis  and  premedication  administration  of  obinutuzumab  for  IRRs  is  noted  in  the SmPC, patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis prior to each subsequent infusion at the physicians  discretion.  Obinutuzumab  should  be  administered  under  appropriate  clinical  setting  as mentioned in the SmPC.

## Neutropenia

The  incidence  of  neutropenia  in  the  study  overall  was  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm,  (31.8%  benda  vs. 37.6% G-benda), mainly due to more grade 4 events in the G-benda arm. No grade 5 event occurred in each arm. In the induction phase the incidence of neutropenia AEs was similar in the two arms (30.8% vs.  31.4%) and also generally constant over time. In the maintenance period with obinutuzumab, the incidence of neutropenia was 11.9%. all the neutropenia AEs resolved and no fatal neutropenia events were reported.

The use of myeloid growth factors was permitted for the primary prevention of febrile neutropenia or as prophylactic support for patients who experienced Grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression with febrile neutropenia, at the investigator's discretion.

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration was prespecified in cases of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia requiring dose delay or modification of bendamustine and/or obinutuzumab. There was no imbalance in the use of G-CSF between the treatment arms as concomitant medication (31.7% in benda arm, 36.6% in G-benda arm).

## Prolonged Neutropenia and Late Onset Neutropenia

Prolonged neutropenia was defined as ANC &lt; 1.0x109 cells/mm3, that had not resolved to within the normal  range  by  the  previous  visit  before  receiving  the  last  dose  of  obinutuzumab.  Late  onset neutropenia  was  defined  as  an  initial  ANC  &lt;  1.0x109/  cells/mm3  at  any  time  after  the  last  dose  of obinutuzumab. Prolonged neutropenia occurred in 5 patients (2.6%) in the G-benda arm. One of these patients had serious instances of prolonged neutropenia. Late onset neutropenia occurred in 14 patients (7.2%) in  the  G-benda  arm  (7  of  these  patients  had  serious  instances  of  late  onset  neutropenia,  one patient had a fatal sepsis.

## Infections

The incidence of infections throughout the whole study was higher in the G-benda arm (65.5%) compared with  55.6%  in  the  benda-arm.  Each  arm  had  a  similar  proportion  of  grade  3-5  infections,  serious infections and fatal infections (7 patients in the benda arm and 5 patients in the G-benda arm) Infections

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in both arms included viral infections (most commonly herpes virus relates infections), fungal infections and bacterial infections with no imbalance between the treatment arms.

One case of Hepatitis B reactivation was reported as an AE in the benda arm, this event recovered after adequate treatment. No cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) in either treatment arm was reported.

## Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia in the study overall  was  higher in  the  benda  arm  compared  with the  G-benda  arm (23.7%  vs.  14.9%).  A  higher  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  during  the  first  cycle  of  therapy  was reported  compared  with  the  subsequent  cycles,  but  no  difference  between  the  two  treatments  arms. There was no grade 5 event of thrombocytopenia in either arms, but the event was reported serious in 4 patients (2.1%) in the G-benda arm vs. none in the benda arm. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was not associated with significant bleeding events. In the benda arm 6.1% patients and 3.6% in the G-benda arm discontinued the treatment due to thrombocytopenia. Most thrombocytopenia events resolved (83% patients with events in each arm), and 21.3% and 34.5% in the benda and G-benda arm respectively received treatment for this AE. One patient in the G-benda arm had acute thrombocytopenia, defined as occurring within 24 h after the infusion. This was a grade 3 serious event, obinutuzumab was interrupted, and the symptoms resolved without treatment.

In the maintenance phase two patients (1.4%) in the G-benda arm had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia after the first maintenance cycle, in the subsequent assessments no events were reported.

The incidence of haemorrhagic events in the study overall was similar in the two treatment arms, 10.1% in  the  benda  arm  vs.  10.8%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  Hemorrhagic  events  were  reported  as  serious  in  3 patients (1.5%) in the benda arm and 6 patients (3.1%) in the G-benda arm. Most events resolved, 85% in each arm, and 30.0% of patients in the benda arm and 47.6% patients in the G-benda arm received treatment for this AE. No grade 5 event was reported.

## Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

TLS was reported in 2 patients (1.0%) in the benda arm and 1 (0.5%) in the G-benda arm. All events occurred during the first cycle of induction, treatment for this AE was given and 2 of the patients could continue study treatment as planned. One patient in the benda arm experienced renal failure on day 17, progressive  lymphoma  and  died  on  day  29.  This  event  was  considered  to  be  related  to  underlying disease, rather than bendamustine.

## Gastrointestinal perforation

Bowel perforation has been reported in a few patients treated with obinutuzumab. In this study 2/194 patients (1%) from the G-benda arm had a bowel perforation. In one patient the perforation was thought to  be  due  to  diverticulitis,  and  the  maintenance  treatment  with  obinutuzumab  was  delayed.  The other patients experienced two abdominal abscesses. Both patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics, both recovered and patient number two continued study medication.

## Cardiac events

The incidence of all grade cardiac AE during the overall study was lower in the benda arm (11) compared with the G-benda (22), (5.6% vs. 11.3%). This was due to different cardiac events: cardiac failure (0% vs.  2.1%),  tachycardia  (1.0%  vs.  2.1%),  bradycardia  (0%  vs.  1.5%)  and  atrial  fibrillation  (1.0%  vs. 2.1%) in benda vs. G- benda arm respectively. The difference was partly driven by symptoms of IRRs. The majority of cardiac events were grade 1 or 2. There were three grade 3-5 AE events, (in 3 patients) in the benda arm: atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and paroxysmal arrhythmia, one was considered an  IRR.  In  the  G-benda  arm  10  grade  3-5  events  (in  9  patients)  were  observed:  atrial  fibrillation  (2 patients),  cardiac  failure  (2  patients),  myocardial  infarction  (1  patient),  acute  coronary  syndrome  (1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient),  atrial  flutter  (1  patient)  coronary  artery  disease  (1  patient)  and  intracardiac  thrombus  (1 patient), none of these were considered IRRs. None of the cardiac events were fatal.

## Second malignancies

Second  malignancies  occurring  6  months  after  the  start  of  therapy  or  later  was  similar  in  the  two treatment arms (5.1% in the benda arm and 7.2% in the G-benda arm).

## Deaths

Until the clinical cut-off date, a total of 41/198 patients (20.7%) in the benda arm and 34/194 patients (17.5%) in the G-benda arm had died during the study. PD was the most common cause of death in each treatment  arm  (benda  29/198,  14.6%;  G-benda  22/194,  11.3%).  Others  died  because  of  AE:  benda 12/198 (6.1%) and in G-benda 12/194 (6.2%).  Death due to AE, was mainly caused by infections, other malignancies  (leukemia,  colorectal  cancer  and  T-cell  lymphoma),  tumour  lysis  syndrome  and  stroke. There was no imbalance in the incidence of fatal events between the two arms.

## Laboratory findings

The  changes  in  hematology  parameters  observed  in  the  G-benda  arm  were  consistent  with  the mechanism of  action  of  obinutuzumab.  Grade  4  neutropenia  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  Gbenda arm, 21.2% vs. 32.0%.

The incidence of AE was higher in patients who had creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min, however number of patients  was  small  and  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  In  116/121  patients,  B-cell depletion  was  only  assessed  in the  G-benda  arm.  It  was  defined  as  CD19 + B-cell  counts  &lt;  0.07x109/L after at least one dose of obinutuzumab had been administered. B-cell depletion started on day 8 of Cycle 1  in  the  majority  of  patients.    At  the  time  of  the  clinical  data  cut-off,  recovery  was  only  noted  in  2 patients.

IgG was affected in 14.9% of the patients and was not recovered at the time of data cut-off. In other chemistry parameters, no notably differences were evident, except that hypocalcemia was more frequent in the G-benda arm (37.6% vs. 25.9%). Urinanalysis showed no clinical important trends.

Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) was positive in two patients at baseline and both patients had an IRR the same day. One patient had a grade 1 IRR and was able to continue on study treatment, the other patient had a grade 4 IRR and obinutuzumab was discontinued.

With the updated results; No major changes in the laboratory hematology or biochemistry parameters were  observed  in  in  the  updated  laboratory  test  analysis  as  compared  with  the  primary  analysis.  As described in the primary CSR, the frequency of Grade 3-4 leucopenia, lymphocytopenia and neutropenia was higher in the G-benda arm than in the benda arm. Notably, there was no difference in the incidence of Grade 3-5 infections between treatment arms (38 patients [18.5%] in the benda arm and 40 patients [19.6%] in the G-benda arm).

## Safety in special populations

Overall, the updated analysis of safety by patient age group (&lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years) were consistent with the  primary  analysis  showing  a  higher  incidence  in  both  treatment  arms  of  clinically  important  AEs, including SAEs, Grade 5 AEs and AEs leading to withdrawal from treatment in patients ≥ 65 years old than in younger patients. The difference in incidence between arms for SAEs in patients ≥ 65 years old remained relatively  consistent  (~10%  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm)  at  both  clinical  cutoff  dates  for  the primary and updated analyses.

The updated analysis of safety by renal function was consistent with the primary analysis. Only a small number  of  patients  (33  [~8%])  had  creatinine  clearance  (CrCL)  of  &lt;  50  mL/min  at  baseline,  and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. In both treatment arms, the incidence of SAEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and deaths was higher in patients with CrCL &lt; 50 L/min at baseline compared with patients with CrCL &gt; 50 L/min at baseline.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab as such interactions are not  expected  with  this  mAb.  A  comparison  of  serum  pharmacokinetic  parameters  from  studies  of obinutuzumab monotherapy (Studies BO20999, BO21003) with pharmacokinetic parameters from studies of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (BO21000) suggests that concomitant chemotherapy has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab.

## Discontinuation and dose modifications due to adverse events

Reasons  for  dose  modifications/discontinuation  were  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia  and  IRRs.  The proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE that led to discontinuation of study medication was  15.7%  in  the  benda  arm  vs.  18.0%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  The  most  common  AEs  that  led  to discontinuation (benda vs. G-benda) were: thrombocytopenia (6.1% and 3.6%, neutropenia (2.5% and 4.6%), infections (3.5% and 2.1%) espec. pneumonia (1.0% in both arms) and IRRs (1.5% and 2.1%)

Dose  modification,  i.e.  dose  reductions  or  increase  were  not  allowed  for  obinutuzumab,  but  dose interruption, delays, discontinuations and reduction of infusion rate were permitted. The incidence of AEs that led to any drug modification (all dose modifications and interruptions) during the entire study was higher  in  the  G-benda  arm  (61.3%)  vs.  the  benda  arm  (43.9%),  mainly  due  to  IRRs  and  comparable symptoms.    Thrombocytopenia  led  to  a  higher  proportion  of  dose  modifications  in  the  benda  arm compared  with  the  G-benda  (18.7%  vs.  11.9%).  The  most  common  AEs  that  resulted  in  dose modification  of  obinutuzumab  were  neutropenia  (21,6  %)  and  thrombocytopenia  (11.3%).  A  higher incidence of AEs leading to bendamustine dose modification (41.4%) in the benda arm than in the Gbenda arm. This was mainly due to the following: thrombocytopenia (benda 18.7% vs. G-benda 9.8%), GI disorders (5.1% vs. 3.6%), mainly nausea, diarrhea and stomatitis and IRR (3.5% vs. 2.1%). A total of 22.2% of patients had an infusion modification of obinutuzumab (i.e., infusion interruptions, slowing or discontinuations) during the Induction Phase, most of which occurred during Cycle 1 (19.6% of patients), and  'AE'  was  the  most  common  reason  (3.1%).  The  most  common  AEs  that  resulted  in  delaying  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

obinutuzumab dose (other than dose interruptions and slowing of the infusion) were neutropenia (21.6%) and  thrombocytopenia  (11.3%).  Most  of  these  modifications  did  not  result  in  discontinuation  of  the infusion;  the  majority  of  patients  (99.4%  to  100%)  of  patients  received  &gt;90%  of  the  planned obinutuzumab  dose  from  Cycle  2  onwards.  The  most  common  AE  that  resulted  in  modifying  the obinutuzumab dose was neutropenia.

## Adverse Events During the Maintenance Phase

Safety data for the maintenance phase are only presented for the G-benda arm.

The AEs reported during the Maintenance Phase accounted for 21.6% (623/2889) of all events reported for the G-benda arm over the entire study. The overall incidence of AEs for patients in the Maintenance Phase was 76.2%, the most common AEs was neutropenia and infections (Table 69). Grade 3-5 AEs were reported in 29.4% of the patients, the most frequent which occurred in ≥ 5% of patients was neutropenia (9.8%). Other grade 3-5 AEs occurred in 1-2 patients. SAEs were reported in 18 patients, most were isolated, with the exception of febrile neutropenia and sepsis.

Other AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients were all Grade 1-2. No grade 5 AEs or deaths were noted and  the  incidence  of  IRRs  and  neutropenia  was  lower  in  the  Maintenance  Phase  compared  with  the Induction Phase.

The AEs that led to withdrawal of patients from study medication during the maintenance period, were pneumonia (2), one had a pseudomonal lung infection, neutropenia (3), AML/MDS (2) and bladder cancer (1 patient).

The most common cause of study drug delay/interruption was neutropenia, which occurred in 14.7% of the patients.

Overall  the  incidence  of  AEPI  was  low  during  the  Maintenance  Phase:  IRRs  (12  patients),  neutropenia (17), infections (67), thrombocytopenia (2) and cardiac event (7 patients). The nature, frequency and severity was consistent with previous experience with obinutuzumab monotherapy.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The collection of safety data was the same in the two treatment arms during the Induction Phase of the study, but for patients in the G-benda arm safety data collection continued in the Maintenance Phase. Thus, differences in safety data between treatment arms should therefore be interpreted in the light of longer treatment period in the G-benda arm, and different safety reporting requirements in each arm.

Clinical safety data are available for a total of 409 patients.  Due to the higher incidence of neutropenia observed in patients given bendamustine in combination with CD20-targeted agents, patients were given different doses of bendamustine in the two arms (120 mg/m 2 /dose in the benda arm vs. 90 mg/m 2 /dose in the G-benda arm. The treatment duration was also different, 6 months in the benda arm (6 cycles of induction  therapy)  and  2.5  years  in  the  G-benda  arm  (6  cycles  of  induction  G-benda  followed  by obinutuzumab maintenance for up to 2 years. At the time of the clinical cutoff date 154 of 204 (75.5%) patients  started  the  Maintenance  Phase  and  29  patients  were  still  receiving  maintenance  treatment; therefore,  the  Follow-Up  period  after  the  completion  of  maintenance  was  relatively  short  and  there  is limited long-term Follow-Up data available.

Overall, the pivotal study demonstrated that induction therapy with obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance has a manageable safety profile that is comparable to that of bendamustine induction therapy alone, apart from a higher incidence of SAEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, and  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification/interruption.  These  differences  were  mainly  due  to  IRRs  and neutropenia,  although  the  incidence  of  neutropenia  was  comparable  in  the  benda  and  G-benda  arms during  the  induction  phase.  Infections  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  G-benda  arm,  but  the difference was modest and did not result in a greater incidence of withdrawals, incidence of Grade 3-5, events or fatal infections. The difference might be due to the longer duration of treatment and longer observation  period  in  the  G-benda  arm,  and/or  differences  in  safety  data  collection  between  the  two arms. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in the benda arm compared to the G-benda arm, probably  due  to  a  higher  dose  of  bendamustine  in  the  benda  arm.  No  difference  was  reported  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

incidence of hemorrhagic events between the two arms, most events were grade 1-2, and the grade 3-4 events were not associated with thrombocytopenia.

The  safety  profile  of  the  study  drugs  in  the  overall  iNHL  and  FL  populations  was  similar.  Overall,  the safety profile of G-benda was similar to that of bendamustine alone and also consistent with previously observed, including in the pivotal study for obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in patients with CLL (Goede V et al. 2015).

Number of AEs during the maintenance with obinutuzumab was lower than during induction. Most AEs were grade 1-2, and the character was well known and manageable: IRRs neutropenia and infections. The  majority  of  IRRs  were  grade  1-2,  no  grade  5  IRRs  were  reported  in  the  study.  The  IRRs  led  to withdrawal of obinutuzumab in only 4 patients (3%), and to withdrawal of bendamustine in 3 patients (2.4%) in the benda arm and 1 patient (0.8%) in the G-benda arm. These data suggests that treatment recommendations  for  prophylaxis  and  management  of  IRRs  (incl.  premedication  with  corticosteroids, adjustment to the infusion rate and other supportive treatment) were effective in preventing/controlling severe  IRRs.  The  nature,  frequency  and  severity  of  AEs  was  consistent  with  previous  experience  with obinutuzumab monotherapy.

Reasons for dose modifications/discontinuation were well known  and manageable: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and IRRs. The treatment arms were balanced with respect to the proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE that led to discontinuation of study medication, 15.7% in the benda arm vs. 18.0% in the G-benda arm. The most common AEs that led to discontinuation (benda vs. G-benda) were: thrombocytopenia (6.1% and 3.6%, neutropenia (2.5% and 4.6%), infections (3.5% and 2.1%) especially pneumonia (1.0% in both arms) and IRRs (1.5% and 2.1%)

The  supportive  studies  provided  additional  evidence  of  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  obinutuzumab maintenance treatment. In supporting studies BO21000 and BO21003, 223 patients received obinutuzumab maintenance treatment for more than 1 year, and 80 patients were treated for the full 2 year period as planned.

Other AEs of special interests were cardiac events, the incidence being higher in the G-benda arm, but with no particular pattern emerging. One third of the events were considered IRRs, and the majority were grade 1 or 2 and manageable. When viewed in isolation, the two cases of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation reported  in  the  G-benda  arm  versus  no  cases  in  the  benda  arm  of  Study  GAO4753g  do  not  provide convincing evidence of a causal role for obinutuzumab in GI perforation due to other confounding factors. However, when viewed in the context of the known risk of GI perforation in NHL patients treated with rituximab, three cases of GI perforation in the supporting studies, and the two cases that occurred in the pivotal study, the data become more compelling. Accordingly, GI perforation, is considered an important identified risk for obinutuzumab.

A rather high incidence of IRRs is noted. Patients should receive prophylactic pre-treatment before the first  dose  of  study  drug  the  treatment  should  be  administered  under  suitable  clinical  settings  and surveillance, as mentioned in the SmPC

The safety profile of obinutuzumab in this study was as expected, as it is an anti-CD20 antibody, with infusion-related reactions (IRRs), neutropenia and infections being the most common adverse events. The safety  profile  of  G-benda  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of  the  individual  study  drugs, including that seen in the pivotal CLL-11 study with obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in patients with CLL (Goede V et al. 2015). The difference between the two treatment arms was mainly due to IRRs and neutropenia and manageable with the recommendations outlined in the protocol and SmPC.

The similarity in safety profile between the two treatment arms is supported by the PRO data, which also was similar in the two treatment arms, indicating no detrimental effect on quality of life with addition of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

obinutuzumab to bendamustine. The time to worsening of quality of life,  measured  by  FACT-Lym  TOI score was extended with obinutuzumab treatment.

Safety data suggested, that older patients and patients with impaired renal function, were more at risk of clinically  important  AEs  than  younger  patients  with  better  renal  function.  However  these  observations applied to both treatment arms and indicate that patients in this clinical setting have a general risk to AEs rather than a risk to obinutuzumab-related events.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, there were no unexpected safety findings or new important risks identified, , the nature, frequency and severity of ARs was consistent with previous experience with obinutuzumab monotherapy, and the regimen of G-benda induction followed by extended treatment with obinutuzumab (maintenance) was manageable and feasible. Safety updates will be provided on an ongoing basis within the PSURs; study completion is expected to occur Q4 2019 and submission of the Final Study report Q4 2020.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In GAO4753g the subgroup of FL comprised 81.1% of the ITT population of iNHL. A 52% reduction in the risk of PD or death based on IRC assessment was observed; the HR for IRC-assessed PFS was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.68, stratified log-rank p-value &lt;0.0001). The median PFS was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.4; 16.2)  in  the  benda  arm  and  had  not  been  reached  in  the  G-benda  arm.    PFS  as  assessed  by  the Investigator confirmed the IRC-assessed PFS results (HR =0.48; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.67, p-value &lt; 0.0001,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stratified log-rank test). The median investigator assessed PFS in the G-benda arm (29.2 months [95% CI: 17.5; NE]) was over twice as long as that in the benda arm (13.7 months [95% CI: 11.0; 15.5]).

Consistent  efficacy  results  for  the  IRC-assessed  PFS  were  observed  in  a  panel  of  sensitivity  analyses including  re-randomization  test,  unstratified  analysis,  several  exploratory  analyses  applying  different censoring  rules  to  evaluate  alternative  definitions  of  PFS  (HRs  for  IRC-assessed  PFS:  0.44-0.57),  and subgroups of patients with FL based on demographics, baseline factors and potential disease prognostic markers.

The benefit of adding obinutuzumab to bendamustine in patients with FL was further supported by the secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrating the robustness of the results. Results of investigator-assessed  PFS  were  consistent  with  those  of  the  IRC  (HR = 0.48;  95%  CI:  0.35,  0.67, stratified log-rank p-value &lt; 0.0001). Best overall (CR/PR) response rates were similar between treatment arms.  The DoR for patients who achieved a CR/PR, and DFS for complete responders were longer in the G-benda arm compared with the benda arm.  Hazard ratios were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.54) for DoR and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.44) for DFS. At the time of the analysis, median OS could not be estimated in either  treatment  arm.  The  updated  OS  data  show  that  the  median  OS  has  not  been  reached  yet,  but fewer  patients  with  FL  had  died  in  the  G-benda  arm  (30/164  [18.3%])  compared  to  the  benda  arm (48/171 [28.1%]). The HR for risk of death in patients with FL was 0.62 (95%CI: 0.39, 0.98) for G-benda vs.  benda.  The  Kaplan  -  Meier  plot  for  OS  in  patients  with  FL  showed  a  clear  separation  of  curves  in favour of the G-benda arm from 6 months and beyond.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

At the time of the analysis, median OS could not be estimated due to small numbers and a relatively short follow-up but a trend towards an improvement in OS is indicated. A final OS analysis will take place after approximately 226 deaths have occurred. The final OS results will be provided with the submission of the final study report.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Despite the difference in treatment duration and safety reporting in the two arms, the incidence of AEs (all  grades)  (98.0%  of  patients  in  the  benda  arm  vs.  98.5%  of  patients  in  the  G-benda  arm),  deaths (20.7% vs. 17.5%), and fatal AEs (6.1% vs. 6.2%) were similar in the two treatment arms. However a higher incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal with G-benda was reported in the G-benda arm. The greater incidence of these events was mainly due to neutropenia and IRRs. In both treatment  arms,  most  fatal  AEs  were  infections  or  second  malignancies  and  there  was  no  notable imbalance in the incidence of particular fatal events between the arms.

Thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequently  reported  in  the  benda  arm  (23.7%)  than  the  G-benda  arm (14.9%); consistent with the higher dose of bendamustine in the benda arm.

Overall, the nature, frequency and severity of AEs of particular or special interest in this pivotal study (IRRs, neutropenia, infection [including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy], TLS, thrombocytopenia [including hemorrhagic events], cardiac events, second malignancy and  HBV reactivation)  were  consistent  with  previous  experience.    Despite  the  frequent  incidence  of  IRRs,  most patients  in  the  G-benda  arm  received  the  full  dose  of  obinutuzumab  and  were  able  to  continue  with obinutuzumab therapy.  The first dose of obinutuzumab could be split over two days if required for IRRs but only one patient had a split dose.

The safety profile of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine in the subgroup of patients with FL was  consistent  with  those  for  the  overall  iNHL  (ITT)  population.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of obinutuzumab  in  patients  with  iNHL  in  the  supporting  studies  was  consistent  with  the  pivotal  Study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GAO4753g and supports the overall safety of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine, as well as the  safety  of  continued  treatment  with  obinutuzumab  monotherapy.    The  supporting  studies  provided additional evidence regarding the long-term safety of obinutuzumab.  Overall, the incidence of AEs during obinutuzumab maintenance treatment was lower than during induction.

Safety data from supporting monotherapy Studies BO20999 and BO21003 demonstrated that obinutuzumab was well tolerated at the doses administered in these Phase I/II studies. There were no reports  of  dose-limiting  toxicities  in  the  Phase  I  stages  of  the  studies  and,  in  general,  no  unexpected safety issues.  Similarly, in the combination Study BO21000 in first-line and relapsed/refractory setting the safety profile of obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual study drugs (CHOP, FC, or bendamustine). No new important safety signals were reported during maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab in this study.

Gastrointestinal perforation was identified as an important identified risk following an integrated analysis of  the  two  cases  of  GI  perforation  reported  in  Study  GAO4753g  and  the  three  reported  cases  of  GI perforation among obinutuzumab-exposed patients in the supporting studies.

In  study  GAO4753g,  the  risk  of  IRRs  is  frequent  with  G-benda,  in  particular  during  the  first  cycle  of treatment (55.2% patients have an IRR in cycle 1). This is coherent with the experience we have with GAZYVARO. Supportive therapies (e.g., supplemental oxygen, β2-agonists/epinephrine, and/or corticosteroids) were allowed for serious IRRs according to standard clinical practice. Management of IRRs is described in the SmPC section 4.2.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The proportion of patients who experienced second malignancies 6 months after starting treatment or later was 5.1% in the benda arm and 7.2% in the G-benda arm. There remains some uncertainty about the long-term risk of secondary cancer (See RMP).

The incidence of types of infections shows no clear pattern. The incidence of infections/infestations could be related to neutropenia and the IgG level. Although no trend is reported, there might exist especially vulnerable populations, which require special attention and where IgG substitution should be considered (See RMP). Safety updates of GA04753g study will be submitted on an ongoing basis within the PSURs.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Patients with relapsing-remitting follicular lymphoma, resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and to rituximab which may progress to a more aggressive high-grade lymphoma have very limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Bendamustine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with rituximab-refractory iNHL.

Although both rituximab and obinutuzumab targets CD20, the binding epitopes as well as their effects are different.  Treatment with G-benda resulted in a statistically clinically relevant and significant reduction by 45% in the risk of IRC-assessed PFS compared with benda alone (HR=0.55 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.74; logrank p-value = 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS was 14.9 months in the benda arm (95% CI: 12.8, 16.6), it was not reached in the G-benda arm. The results of investigator-assessed PFS were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis,  median  PFS  was  14.0  months  in  the  benda  arm  and  29.2 months  in  the  G-benda  arm  (HR  0.52,  95%  CI:  0.39,  0.70;  log-rank  test  p-value&lt;0.0001).  Updated analyses of PFS are consistent with the primary analysis. The updated OS data show that the median OS has not been reached yet, but fewer patients with FL had died in the G-benda arm (30/164 [18.3%]) compared to the benda arm (48/171 [28.1%]).

The tolerability of the combined regimen appears as expected in this clinical setting.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance of Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine followed by Gazyvaro maintenance for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months after treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen, is positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The natural history of iNHL is chemo-sensitive and with a generally good prognosis at diagnoses, but relapsing-remitting with serial intermittent courses of treatment required over several years. Typically the diseases become increasingly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and to rituximab as well as histologic transformation to high-grade NHL can occur which are more aggressive. Bendamustine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with rituximab-refractory iNHL, but there is clearly an unmert medical need in this setting.

The difference in PFS between the two treatment arms in patients with FL, favouring obinutuzumab + bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance is statistically significant and clinically important and seems robust, although the OS data are still not mature. Further, a longer DoR and DFS was reported in  the  G-benda  arm  compared  with  the  benda  arm.  There  is  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically

meaningful reduction in the risk of PD or death with the association obinutuzumab + bendamustine in the FL population. The overall survival update from the pivotal trial will be provided with the final analysis, which was defined as the time point when 226 deaths will have occurred. Study completion is expected by Q4 2019.

The safety profile is acceptable. Updated safety information will be included in the PSURs.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to add the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma based on the results of the pivotal study GAO4753g. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of indication to add the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma based on the results of the pivotal study GAO4753g. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.
