## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 5 July 2018 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include paediatric study results (from studies A6181196 and ACNS1021) performed in compliance with a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). In addition the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in the PL.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

The application included an EMA Decision P/0147/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0147/2018 was completed .

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0147/2018.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The aim of the variation is to update Sutent SmPC to include paediatric study results from studies A6181196 and ACNS1021 performed in compliance with a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), in order to provide physicians with the available information (dosing, administration, adverse reactions, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity) in paediatric cancer patients, including those with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The MAH is not seeking an indication in the paediatric population, as the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST do not conclusively support a sufficiently favourable benefit/risk profile.

The data (clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety) included in this submission were collected from 3 clinical studies: ADVL0612, ACNS1021, and A6181196. They were conducted globally to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumors (Study ADVL0612), to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) to sunitinib in recurrent/progressive/refractory high-grade glioma (HGG) or ependymoma in pediatric (aged 18 months to 17 years) and young adult (aged 18 to 22 years) patients (Study ACNS1021), and to evaluate the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric and young adult patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST (Study A6181196). Furthermore, results from 3 modeling analysis reports, which provide additional sunitinib PK data, have been included in the submission.

According to the MAH, based on the clinical pharmacology results, a starting dose of 20 mg/m 2 /day on Schedule 4/2 is predicted to provide comparable systemic sunitinib exposures to those observed in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, data from the phase I study ADVL0612 identified the 15 mg/m2/day as the sunitinib MTD in paediatric subjects without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation. As stated by the MAH in the RSI, the MTD projection in ADVL0612 study was done in heavily pretreated pediatric patients mainly with CNS tumors. In addition, the starting dose in both clinical trial A6181196 and ACNS1021 was 15 mg/m 2  (based on the MTD) with the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity. Further, the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was higher than 20 mg/m 2 . The information that children treated in clinical trials/in case series received starting or average daily doses of 20 mg/m 2  is not emerging from the SmPC, therefore it appeared somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 mg/m 2 , and that 20 mg/m 2  is the dose in paediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST. As per CHMP request, the MAH modified the SmPC section 5.2 to describe the dosages of Sutent received by pediatric patients in the clinical experience, in order to clarify the apparent contradiction between MTD and wording on 20 mg/m 2 .

Based on the clinical data provided in paediatric patients with GIST (i.e. study A6181196 and 3 case series from literature), due to the lack of objective confirmed radiological responses, the limited number of patients in the clinical trial, the intrinsic limitations of retrospective case series, along with the indolent nature of GIST in paediatric patients, it is agreed that the available evidence does not conclusively support the clinical activity of sunitinib in children with GIST.

The benefit-risk balance of Sutent remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include paediatric study results (from studies A6181196 and ACNS1021) performed in compliance with a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). In addition the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in the PL.

is recommended for approval.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0147/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB are recommended.

## 5. Introduction

Sunitinib is an orally active small molecule multiple RTKs (PDGFRα -β, VEGFR1 -2-3, KIT, FLT3, CSF-1R, RET) inhibitor, currently approved for metastatic RCC, GIST and pNET in adults.

This  application  relates  to  the  submission  of  paediatric  study  results  with  Sutent,  performed  in compliance with a PIP. The following data are included in the dossier:

- Study A6181196 \"A Phase I Study of Sunitinib (SU11248), an Oral Multi-Targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, in Children With Refractory Solid Tumours\";

-  Study ACNS1021 \"A Phase II Study of Sunitinib in Recurrent, Refractory or Progressive High-Grade Glioma and Ependymoma Tumours in Paediatric and Young Adult Patients\";

- Retrospective analyses of medical records from paediatric and young adult patients with GIST treated with sunitinib from 3 case-series publications;

- Population Modeling Analysis Report.

The scope of this Type II variation is to support the inclusion of relevant paediatric data in the sunitinib SmPC  (dosing,  administration,  adverse  reactions,  pharmacokinetics,  and  clinical  activity)  to  inform physicians of the available information in paediatric cancer patients, including those with gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST).  The  MAH  is  not  seeking  an  indication  in  the  paediatric population, as the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST do not conclusively support a sufficiently favorable benefit/risk profile.

The PDCO adopted on 29 June 2018 an opinion confirming the compliance of all studies in the agreed PIP  (P/0147/2018).  The  PDCO  positive  opinion  has  been  included  by  the  MAH  in  the  dossier (EMA/PDCO/255740/2018).

The MAH stated that an updated RMP will be provided by 3Q2018.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

Results  from  3  modeling  analysis  reports,  which  provide  additional  sunitinib  PK  data  have  been provided:

· Population Modeling Analysis Report (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366) entitled 'Population Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics of Sunitinib  in  Patients  with  GIST  and  Solid  Tumors'  describes key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib and its active metabolite, SU012662, using pooled PK data from all studies in adult and paediatric patients with GIST or solid tumours. Two-compartment models  with  lag  time  were  successfully  used  to  describe  the  PK  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662. Mechanism-based and semi-mechanistic PK-Pharmacodynamics (PD) models were successfully built to describe key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib.

· Population Modeling Analysis Report (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846) entitled 'Population Pharmacokinetics of Sunitinib in Paediatric Patients with GIST and Other Solid Tumors' presents the results  of  a  population  PK  model  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662  using  pooled  PK  data  from  studies  in paediatric  patients  with  GIST  or  other  solid  tumours  (ie,  Studies  ADVL0612,  ACNS1021,  and A6181196).

· Physiologically based (PB) population PK Report (PBPK SimCYP Report) entitled 'SIMCYP Prediction of Sunitinib  Exposure  in  Paediatrics'  presents  the  analysis  of  the  prediction  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662 exposures in paediatric patients using PBPK simulations with SimCYP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the MAH, based on the clinical pharmacology results, a starting dose of 20 mg/m2/day on Schedule 4/2 in paediatric patients with GIST (within age ranges from 6 years to 11 years and from 12 years to 17 years) is predicted to provide comparable systemic sunitinib exposures to those observed in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2.

Following  discussions  with  the  EMA's  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO),  the  MAH  agreed  to  conduct  the single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial  of  single-agent  sunitinib (Study A6181196) to investigate the use of sunitinib for the treatment of paediatric GIST, collecting safety, PK, and efficacy data in children aged 6 years to less than 18 years. The PDCO recommended a primary endpoint of PK parameters of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662.

The  PDCO  accepted  the  MAH's  proposal  to  conduct  population  PK  and  PK-PD  analyses  to  help extrapolate the PK and key safety and efficacy endpoints of sunitinib to paediatric GIST patients based on the available data in adult patients with GIST or non-GIST solid tumours and paediatric patients with non-GIST solid tumours. The analysis results were compared to the available safety and efficacy data in paediatric GIST patients from available literature to confirm the predictability of the models in paediatric GIST patients (PMAR-EQDD-A618w- Other-366).

In addition, the MAH was requested to perform an integrated population PK analysis of the data from 3 paediatric studies of sunitinib (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846). The MAH was also requested to build a PBPK  model  for  sunitinib  in  which  the  predicted  PK  concentrations  were  compared  to  the  observed concentrations in paediatric patients with GIST or solid tumours (Measure 5 of the PIP). The results of the  former  analysis  are  presented  in  the  PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  and  the  results  of  the  PBPK analysis are presented in the PBPK SimCYP report (PBPK SimCYP Report).

## 6.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

One  of  the  main  objective  of  the  present  application  is  to  provide  supportive  PK  data  for  the administration  of  sunitinib  in  pediatric  patients.  Clinical  studies  included  in  this  package  were conducted globally to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib in pediatric patients with  refractory  solid  tumors  (Study  ADVL0612),  to  estimate  the  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  to sunitinib  in  recurrent/progressive/refractory  high-grade  glioma  (HGG)  or  ependymoma  in  pediatric (aged 18 months to 17 years) and young adult (aged 18 to 22 years) patients (Study ACNS1021), and to evaluate the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric and young adult patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST (Study A6181196).

The  PK  data  included  in  this  summary  of  clinical  pharmacology  were  collected  from  3  studies: ADVL0612, ACNS1021, and A6181196:

## Study A6181196

Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children diagnosed with advanced unresectable GIST. The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2  per day administered orally on  Schedule  4/2.  The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  characterize  the  plasma  PK  profile  of sunitinib and SU012662 in children and young adults with advanced unresectable GIST. The primary study endpoints were the PK parameters of sunitinib and SU012662, including AUC24 (total plasma exposure [AUC from 0 to 24 hrs]) and oral clearance (CL/F).

The assessment of the paediatric study for Sutent (A6181196) was already done and the conclusion was  that  the  number  of  patients  enrolled  do  not  allow  to  draw  any  sound  conclusion  about pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  children  and  young  adults  diagnosed  with advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).

## Study ADVL0612

Study ADVL0612 was an open-label, dose-escalation, sequential-cohort, Phase 1 clinical study of oral sunitinib in children with refractory solid tumours. Of note, children and young adults were included in this study as 3, 7, and 6 patients ≤ 12 years of age in Part A, Part B, and Part C, respectively, and as 2 and  1  patients  &gt;18  years  of  age  in  Part  A  and  Part  C,  respectively.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to determine  the  MTD  of  sunitinib  when  given  on  the  recommended  adult  Schedule  4/2.  The  clinical pharmacology objectives of  this  study  were  to  characterize  the  PK  of  oral  sunitinib  in  children  with refractory solid tumours and to evaluate the tolerability and PK profile of sunitinib capsule contents sprinkled over apple sauce or yogurt using the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined from the dose-escalation part of this study. This study included 3 parts:

-  Part  A  (12  patients  -  full  analysis  population)  (interpatient  dose  escalation):  The  starting  dose  of sunitinib was 20 mg/m 2  QD with dose levels for subsequent groups of patients of 30 mg/m 2  QD and 40 mg/m 2   QD.  If  the  MTD  had  been  exceeded  at  the  first  dose  level,  then  the  subsequent  cohort  of patients were treated at the 15 mg/m2 QD dose level.
- Part B (11 patients - full analysis population) (interpatient dose escalation): After observing cardiacrelated  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  in  Part  A  of  the  study,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  exclude

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with previous anthracycline or cardiac radiation exposure. Part B was initiated to determine the MTD in the revised study population. The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2  QD with dose levels for subsequent groups of patients of 20 mg/m2 QD or 30 mg/m2 QD. Patients in Part B of the study had not received prior anthracycline treatment or cardiac radiation exposure.

-  Part  C  (12  patients  -  full  analysis  population):  All  patients  treated  in  Part  C  received  the  RP2D determined in Part B. Patients in Part C took each sunitinib dose using the powder contained within sunitinib capsules sprinkled onto 5 mL of apple sauce or yogurt per capsule.

This study was evaluated during the procedure n. EMA/H/C/687/P46-048. Overall, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analyses appeared to be adequate. However, Pk modelling have been encouraged (PopPK, PBPK).

In comparison to adults, the single-dose maximum and 0-24 hours concentrations exposures as well as the steady state trough plasma exposures in children with solid tumours appear to be higher for both sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662. The correlative analyses with respect to the effect

of  body  size  and  age  supported  dosing based on  body  surface  area  to  ensure  uniform  total  plasma exposures across different body sizes and age ranges in children.

## Study ACNS1021

Study ACNS1021 was an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial designed to estimate the ORR for sunitinib in 2 strata of recurrent/progressive/refractory HGG and ependymoma in paediatric (ages 18 months to 17 years) and young adult (ages 18 years to 22 years) patients. Patients received sunitinib 15 mg/m2 as  capsules  in  6-week  cycles.  The  clinical  pharmacology  objective  (secondary)  of  the  study  was  to describe  the  PK  profile  of  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  taking  sunitinib.  The  summary  of  PK parameters for each study group is provided in the table below:

Based on the PK results of Study ACNS1021, both sunitinib and its active metabolite appeared to reach steady  state  by  Day  14  of  Cycle  1.  The  Day  14  mean  steady-state  trough  plasma  exposures  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sunitinib (39.7 ng/mL), SU012662 (16.2 ng/mL), and total drug (55.9 ng/mL) appeared to be slightly higher  than  those  observed  in  the  Phase  1  Study  ADVL0612  by  20.3%,  1.25%,  and  14.1%, respectively.  The  plasma  exposures  to  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  appeared  to  be  similar between patients in the HGG group and those in the ependymoma group. The dose-corrected plasma exposures to sunitinib and SU012662 appeared to be higher in children in this study as compared to adults in Study ADVL0612, indicating potentially lower CL/F per BSA in children as compared to adults.

A total of 12 patients consented and had blood samples drawn for pharmacodynamic studies, of these samples  for  only  9  patients  (2  in  the  glioma  group  and  7  in  the  ependymoma  group)  resulted  in sufficient quality of protein in the plasma for analyses. Profile plots of VEGF and VEGFR2 levels were analysed: the mean plasma VEGF level did not significantly change from Day 1 (106.9 pg/mL) to Day 14 (142.8 pg/mL) or to Day 28 (128.2 pg/mL). However, there was a decrease in mean VEGFR2 levels from 12379 pg/mL on Day 1 to 10103 pg/mL on Day 14 and 9676 pg/mL on Day 28.

No  other  correlative  analyses  were  performed  and  PBMCs  were  not  analyzed.  No  tumor  tissue evaluations (genotyping and protein expression) were performed.

## Population  Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics  of  Sunitinib  in  Patients  with  GIST  and Solid Tumors (PMAREQDD-A618w-Other-366)

Dataset: The PK and PD (safety and efficacy) data collected during Studies 248-ONC-0511-002, RTKC0511-005, RTKC-0511-016, RTKC-0511-018 in adult patients with solid tumors, ADVL0612 in pediatric patients  with  solid  tumors,  A6181004,  A6181045,  A6181047,  RTKC-0511-013 in adult patients with GIST were pooled for the population PK and PK-PD analyses. For the population PK and safety PK-PD analyses,  only the studies in patients with solid tumors and GIST were used whereas for efficacy PKPD analyses only studies of patients with GIST were used.

All  the  available  safety  data  from  Study  ADVL0612  were  included  in  the  PK-PD  analyses  for  safety endpoints. However, for efficacy, the PK-PD modeling for the Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) only included adult GIST data.

The analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling methodology as implemented in NONMEM (Version 7.2, University of California at San Francisco, California). Analyses were performed using the first order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCE INTERACTION) approximation  method  in  NONMEM.  Additional  softwares  used  in  the  analyses  of  the  data  were  SPlus® Version 8.0, Xpose Version 4 and PsN Version 3.1.2.

Based  on  the  prior  knowledge,  a  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (NONMEM subroutine ADVAN4) was used as the initial model to fit to sunitinib and SU012662 concentrations. The disposition  kinetics  were  modeled  using  a  parameterization  involving  apparent  clearance  (CL/F),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

central compartment apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), and peripheral compartment apparent volume of distribution (Vp/F). In addition, a first order absorption rate constant (ka) and a lag-time parameter (tlag) were used to characterize the absorption process.

During  the  sequential  PK-PD  modeling  portion,  safety  endpoints  such  as  absolute  neutrophil  count, platelet count, LVEF, BP, lymphocyte count, ALT, and AST as well as efficacy endpoint SLD were used.

The type of base models tested were transit compartments in series with feedback loop model, the indirect  response  model,  the  indirect  response  tumor  model  with  tolerance  function,  and  Gompertz tumor model.

Initially, attempts were made to incorporate the sum of predicted concentrations of sunitinib and its active  metabolite,  instead  of  sunitinib  alone,  into  the  sequential  PK-PD  base  models  for  selected endpoints (ie, SLD, platelet count, ANC, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count); however, this approach did not lead to any noticeable improvements in the model objective function value and performance and was associated with significantly longer run times, and in some instances led to model instability or run terminations. Therefore, only the predicted sunitinib concentrations, based on its final PK model, were used to produce the drug effects while building the base and final sequential PK-PD models for different endpoints.

The estimate of intersubject variability was provided as 95% confidence interval calculated as mean 1.96∙standard error and mean + 1.96∙standard error. The within -individual variability was modeled as an additive term on the logtransformed concentration following both-sides log-transformed approach for both PK and PD.

Covariates  investigation  was  performed  using  the  basic  model.  The  covariates  were  subjected  to  a stepwise forward selection algorithm using a likelihood ratio test based on the change in the extended least squares minimum objective function ( ∆MOF). The significance level (α ) chosen for covariate entry into  a  PK  or  PK-PD  parameter  submodel was 0.01 (∆MOF of 6.63). Covariates were systematically entered into the sub-models in steps, where the covariate with the greatest ∆ MOF for each step was entered into the sub-model unless the addition of the covariate into the model resulted in instability of the  model.  This  process  was  continued  until  the  final  step,  where  no  covariates  could  meet  the criterion for entry. This model was considered the full model. The full model obtained from the forward selection procedure was subjected to a backward elimination algorithm using a significance level of α =0.001  (∆MOF=10.83).  This  process was  repeated  until  all  of  the  remaining  covariate  parameters, when excluded one at a time, resulted in significant likelihood ratio tests (p≤0.001). This model was considered the final model. The covariates examined during building the final PK and PK-PD models are listed below:

The  effect  of  extreme  outliers  (|CWRES|&gt;6)  on  the  population  PK  parameter  estimates  and  on  the diagnostic  plots  were  tested  and  based  on  each  extreme  outlier  observation  assessment,  20 observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset.

## Population Modeling Analysis Report (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846)

For the integrated population PK (popPK) analyses in pediatric patients with GIST and solid tumors, the PK data collected from Studies ADVL0612, ACNS1021, and A6181196 in pediatric patients with GIST and  other  solid  tumors  were  pooled  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846).  The  objectives  of  the  popPK analysis  were    to  identify  covariates  which  account  for  the  inter-individual  variability  in  the  PK  of sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  and  to  make  predictions  pediatric  patients  with  GIST  within  age ranges 6-11 and 12-17 years of age.

The analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling methodology as implemented in NONMEM  (Version  7.1.2,  University  of  California  at  San  Francisco,  California).  Analyses  were performed using FOCEI. Additional software used in the analyses of the data were S-Plus Version 8.0, RStudio, Xpose Version 4 and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN) Version 3.2.12.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based  on  the  prior  knowledge,  a  2  compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (NONMEM subroutine ADVAN4) was used as the initial model to fit to sunitinib and SU012662 concentrations. The disposition  kinetics  were  modeled  using  a  parameterization  involving  apparent  clearance  (CL/F), central compartment apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), and peripheral compartment apparent volume of distribution (Vp/F). In addition, a first-order absorption rate constant (ka) and a tlag were used to characterize the absorption process. The FOCEI estimation  method  was  used  to  estimate  all  the  parameters.  The  models  used  in  this  study  were mainly  adopted  from  the  study  of  Population  Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics  of  Sunitinib  in Patients with GIST and Solid Tumors (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366).

Intersubject  variability  was  included  on  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  parent  and metabolite SU012662, including CL/F, Vc/F, and ka. The within-individual variability was modeled as an additive term on the log-transformed concentration following both-sides log-transformed approach for PK:

where ln(Yij) denotes the observed concentration for the ith patient at time tj on logarithm scale, the ln(Fij) denotes the corresponding model-predicted concentration on logarithm scale, and εi j denotes the intraindividual random effect, assumed to have a mean of zero and variance σ2 of 1 . W was the estimated variance of the residual variability that was one of the θs to be estimated.

Based on prior experience, the following group of potential covariates were predefined in the PMAP:

Potential  covariates  were  initially  graphically  plotted  against  ETAs  to  identify  any  relationships. Subsequently,  identified  covariates  were  tested  for  significance  in  a  stepwise  manner  using  the stepwise covariate model building procedure (SCM) application in PSN with statistical criteria of α=0.01 for  forward  inclusion  step,  which  corresponds  to  an  objective  function  value  (OFV)  change  of  6.63 based  on  a  Chisquare  (χ2)  distribution  with  degrees  of  freedom (df)=1.  The  full  model  was  then subjected to a backward elimination step with a statistical criteria of α=0.001, which corresponds to an OFV change of 10.84 based on a χ2 distribution with df=1. The full model obtained from the forward selection  procedure  was  subjected  to  a  backward  elimination  algorithm  using  a  significance  level  of α=0.001 (ΔMOF=10.83). This model was considered the final model.

The  percentage  of  post-baseline  observations  which  were  BLQ  was  only  5.8%  (27/466)  and  10.5% (49/466) for sunitinib and SU012662, respectively. Therefore, the effect of BLQ data on modeling was not evaluated.

The  dataset  for  the  pooled  analysis  comprised  439  sunitinib  and  417  SU012662  post-baseline measurable plasma observations from 65 patients treated with sunitinib.

## Sutent model

A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption including tlag for absorption and elimination rates was  used  as  initial  model  for  sunitinib.  This  model  has  been  previously  used  to  describe  the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib. The correlation between the eta values for CL/F and Vc/F, CL/F and ka, and  Vc/F  and  ka  was  estimated  and  appeared  to  be  weak  (0.57,  -0.07,  and  -0.07,  respectively); hence, a full or partial omega block was not included in the base model for sunitinib. In addition, the diagnostic plots appear to be satisfactory and the model appeared to be very stable, as indicated by the condition number. Subsequently, the effect of extreme outliers (|CWRES|&gt;6) on the population PK parameter  estimates  and  on  the  diagnostic  plots  was  tested  and  based  on  each  extreme  outlier observation  assessment,  four  observations  with  |CWRES|&gt;6  were  excluded  from  the  dataset.  They were considered influential outlier observations as their exclusion led to greater than 15% changes in the ω of CL/F,  Vc/F  and  Ka.  The  magnitude of the spread for observations versus IPRED was small around the line of identity, indicating that the model predicted the individual concentrations well. In the base model, η estima tes appeared normally distributed and displayed mean near zero for the PK parameters.

To evaluate model stability and the CI of the final parameter estimates, a nonparametric bootstrapping approach was used (1000 replicates). The median values from 1,000 bootstrapping analysis runs were similar  to  the  parameter  estimates  of  the  dataset,  and  the  bootstrapped  95%  CIs  overlapped  with those of the final  dataset,  suggesting  that the  model  parameters  were  stable  with  the  exception  of Vp/F. The η -shrinkage was only 7.8% and 32% for CL/F and Vc/F, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The typical value for CL/F was estimated to be 24 L/h, Vc/F was estimated to be 1030 L. The key PK parameters in the final model with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect are shown below :

CL/F = 24L/hr · (BSA/1.44) 0.733

During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on CL/F using a power function as  above.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  graphical  plots  that  showed  a  trend  with  BSA  and  this  PK parameter. The inclusion of BSA on CL/F was statistically significant (α=0.001). T he inclusion of BSA on CL/F in the final model corrected for the previously observed trend in plots o f η on CL/F versus BSA in the base model.

V c/F = 1030L ·(BSA/1.44) 1.46

During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on Vc/F using a power function. This effect is consistent with graphical plots that showed a trend with BSA and this PK parameter. The inclusion of BSA on Vc/F was statistically significant (α=0.001). The inclusion of BSA on Vc/F in the final model corrected for the previously observed trend in plots of η on Vc/F v ersus BSA in the base model.

The  bootstrap  results  were  consistent  with  the  population  parameters  estimates  indicating  that  the final model was stable and that the population parameter estimates from the final model represented the final dataset adequately.

Inclusion of baseline BSA as a covariate into the final mode reduced interpatient variability of CL/F and Vc/F by 23.6% and 76.6%.

## SU012662 Model

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption including tlag for absorption and elimination rates was used as initial model for SU012662. Based upon pre-clinical observations, a conversion of 21 % of the  total  parent  to  metabolite  was  assumed  to  bring  the  magnitude  of  the  parameters  to  a  more physiologically relevant level. This model has been widely used for previous sunitinib and SU012662 reports. The correlation between the eta values for CL/F and Vc/F, CL/F and ka, and Vc/F and ka was estimated and appeared to be weak (0.453, -0.131, and -0.123, respectively); hence, a full or partial omega  block  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  SU012662.  In  addition,  the  diagnostic  plots appear  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  model  appeared  to  be  very  stable,  as  indicated  by  the  condition number. Subsequently, the effect  of  extreme  outliers  (|CWRES|&gt;6)  on  the  PK  parameter  estimates and on the diagnostic plots was tested and based on each extreme outlier observation assessment, two observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset. They were considered influential outlier  observations  as  their  exclusion  led  to  greater  than  15%  changes  in  intraindividual  random effects. Therefore, Model 2 was carried forward. The magnitude of the spread for observations versus IPRED  was  small  around  the  line  of  identity,  indicating  that  the  model  predicted  the  individual concentrations well. In the base model, η estimates appeared normally distributed and displayed mean near zero for the PK parameters.

To evaluate model  stability and  the CIs of the final  parameter  estimates,  a  nonparametric bootstrapping approach was used (1000 replicates; 91.8% successful). The median values from 1,000 bootstrapping  analysis  runs  were  similar  to  the  parameter  estimates  of  the  base  model,  and  the bootstrapped 95% CIs overlapped with those of the original dataset, suggesting that the model was stable with the exception of Vp/F and Q/F. The large relative standard errors of Vp/F and Q/F may be related  to  the  sampling  schedule.  The  η -shrinkage  was  only  8.15%  and  15.6%  for  CL/F  and  Vc/F, respectively.

The effects of different covariates (Model 3) on CL/F and Vc/F were examined following initial screening using  SCM  to  identify  significant  covariates  to  be  tested  and  subsequently  by  applying  forward selection and backward elimination procedure until the final model was identified (Model 4). The typical value for CL/F was estimated to be 11.1 L/h, Vc/F was estimated to be 1060 L. The key PK parameters in the final model with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect are shown below

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on CL/F using a power function. This effect is consistent with graphical plots that showed a trend with BSA and this PK parameter. The inclusion of BSA on CL/F was statistically significant (α=0.001).

During the SCM analysis, the effect of BSA was statistically significant on Vc/F using a power function as  above.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  graphical  plots  that  showed  a  trend  with  BSA  and  this  PK parameter. The inclusion of BSA on Vc/F was statistically significant (α=0.001).

The  bootstrap  results  were  consistent  with  the  population  parameters  estimates  indicating  that  the final model was stable and that the population parameter estimates from the final model represented the  final  dataset  adequately.  Inclusion  of  baseline  BSA  as  a  covariate  into  the  final  mode  reduced interpatient variability of CL/F and Vc/F by 32.4% and 58%.

## PBPK SimCYP

The  objective  of  this  analysis  was  to  predict  the  exposure  of  sunitinib  (SU011248)  and  its  active metabolite  SU012662  in  paediatrics  using  physiologically-based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  simulations with SimCYP (version 16, release 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sunitinib  has  been  studied  in  3  paediatric  studies:  in  children  (target  age:  2  to  21  years;  actually enrolled from 3 to 21 years) with refractory solid tumours in Study ADVL0612; in children (target age: 18 months to 22 years; actually enrolled from 3 to 19 years) with recurrent, refractory, or progressive high grade glioma and ependymoma tumours in Study ACNS1021; and in children (target age: 6 to 18 years;  actually  enrolled  from  13  to  16  years)  with  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST)  in  Study A6181196.

The results of the clinical studies, including the mass-balance study and the 3 paediatric studies, were used to validate the performance of the PBPK model for sunitinib and SU012662. The sunitinib and SU012662  compound  files  were  developed  in-house  and  verified  using  available  clinical  data.  The compound  files  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  created  in  SimCYP  based  on  physico-chemical properties and human PK data, as summarised below:

## Sunitinib

The model development employed a combined 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' approach to fully utilise the available in vitro or in silico experimental data and in vivo observed clinical data. The first-order absorption  model  parameterised  with  a  fraction  of  administered  dose  absorbed  (Fa),  first  order absorption rate constant [time-1] (ka), and lag time for absorption (Tlag) was selected to describe the absorption  process  of  sunitinib  in  humans.  Ka  and  Tlag  were  set  as  0.236  h-1  and  0.527  h, respectively, based on the popPK analysis for the adults. The full PBPK distribution model was selected. The tissue composition-based model implemented in SimCYP (Method 2), proposed by Rodgers and Rowland, was selected to predict the steady-state volumes of distribution (= CL·MRT) (Vss), with the tissue:plasma partition coefficients (Kp) scalar adjusted to make the Vss/F as 29 L/kg, which was the Vss/F  of  sunitinib  estimated  from  the  population  PK  analysis  for  the  adults.  The  retrograde  model implemented in the SimCYP was used to back-calculate the hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,hep) from the population PK analysis for the adults estimated plasma clearance (apparent oral clearance [CL/F] of 37.2 L/h). Based on the [14C]sunitinib human mass-balance study, the Fa value was estimated to be 79.1% since 60.9% of the dose was ascribed to be metabolites of sunitinib, which are considered to be formed following oral absorption or drug-related entities (including sunitinib) excreted renally. After correction with the total recovery of 77%, Fa was 79.1%. Furthermore, based on the mass-balance study, the renal clearance (CLr) of sunitinib was set to 4.05 L/h. The transformation of sunitinib to SU012662  was  primarily  through  CYP3A4.  The  fraction  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  (Fm,CYP3A4)  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

determined by dividing the total amount of SU012662 recovered in the faeces and urine by the total amount of  sunitinib  absorbed  minus  the  amount  of  sunitinib  excreted  renally.  The  Fm,CYP3A4  was calculated as 66.5%. After entering the values for CLr, Fa, fraction of drug remaining after first-pass through the intestinal wall (Fg), and Fm,CYP3A4 information in the retrograde model, CYP3A4 intrinsic clearance (CLint) and the additional microsomal CLint,hep were estimated to be 0.603 µL/min/pmol and 41.6 µL/min/mg protein, respectively.

## SU012662

The  CYP3A4  mediated  metabolism  of  sunitinib  was  used  as  the  input  of  SU012662.  The  full  PBPK distribution model was selected. The tissue composition-based model implemented in SimCYP (Method 2), proposed by Rodgers and Rowland, was selected to predict the Vss. The Kp scalar was adjusted to make the Vss/F as 42.3 L/kg, which was the Vss/F of SU012662 estimated from the population PK analysis  for  the  adults.  In  vivo  clearance  (CL)  was  derived  based  on  the  amount  of  SU012662 recovered  divided  by  the  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  from  time  0  to  infinity (AUCinf) of SU012662 in the mass-balance study, and was calculated to be 36.8 L/h.

A 2-compartmental model with first order absorption and elimination rates were used as initial models for  sunitinib  active  metabolite  SU012662.  Following  exclusion  of  observations  with  apparent  dosing errors, the effect of inclusion of lag time was tested and appeared to result in a significant change in OFV,  hence,  lag  time  for  absorption  was  included  in  the  base  model  for  both  sunitinib  and  its metabolite  Also,  the  diagnostic  plots  appear  to  be  satisfactory  and  the  model  appeared  to  be  very stable.  Subsequently,  the  effect  of  extreme  outliers  (|CWRES|&gt;6)  on  the  population  parameter estimates and on the diagnostic plots were tested and based on each extreme outlier assessment, 10 observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset.

For  categorical  safety  endpoints  hand  foot  syndrome,  fatigue,  nausea  and  vomiting,  the  PK-PD modeling was not used; however, the relationships between the average sunitinib plasma exposures up  to  time  of  the  earliest  worst  grade  and  the  incidence  rate  were  explored  by  using  ordered categorical logistic regression models. The individual average sunitinib exposure (concentration) up to time of earliest worst grade was calculated as the total dose up to the time of earliest worst grade divided by individual post hoc CL/F estimate for sunitinib divided by the time post first dose up to the time of earliest worst grade for the categorical safety endpoint. Based on sunitinib final PK and PK-PD models, trial simulations were performed to make predictions with respect to PK and key safety and efficacy endpoints in pediatric and adult patients with GIST.

## ALT

The PK-PD response model with KPD 1st ordered rate Contant (ie, slope) on Kout appeared to be the only model with successful minimization which met the diagnostic criteria and therefore was selected as the base model. The correlation between the eta values for BASE and Kout, BASE and KPD, and Kout and KPD were -0.073, 0.06, and -0.29; hence, a full block or partial block model was not included in  the  base  model  for  ALT.  Based  on  each  extreme  outlier observation assessments, 6 observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset.  The key PK-PD parameter in the final model (with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect is: BASE = 20.5*(AGE/55) -0.188 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It appeared to be the most parsimonious model and was selected as the base model. The correlations between the eta values for BASE and MTT, BASE and Emax, BASE and EC50, MTT and Emax, MTT and EC50, Emax and EC50 were -0.0001, -0.098, 0.24, 0.089, -0.15, and -0.53, respectively; hence, a full block or partial omega block was not included in the base model for ANC. Based on extreme outlier observation assessments, 8 observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset.

## Diastolic Blood Pressure

The PK-PD response model with KPD 1st ordered rate constant (ie, slope) on Kin appeared to be the most parsimonious model with successful minimization, lower OFV, and lower eta shrinkage which met the diagnostic criteria and therefore was selected as the base model. The correlation between the eta values for BASE and Kout, BASE and KPD, and Kout and KPD were 0.083, -0.10, -0.22, respectively; hence,  a  full  block  or  partial  block  model  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  diastolic  blood pressure.  Based  on  each  extreme outlier  observation  assessments,  4  observations  with  |CWRES|&gt;6 were  excluded  from  the  dataset.

## Hemoglobin

Reduced model such as TCSFL with KPD type effect or simpler models such as IDR model was also examined and the reduced model with KPD type effect appeared to be the most parsimonious model and was selected as the base model. The correlations between the eta values for BASE and MTT, BASE and KPD, MTT and KPD were 0.15, -0.11, and -0.06, respectively; hence, a full block or partial omega block  was  not  included  in  the  base  model  for  hemoglobin.  Based  on  extreme  outlier  observation assessments, 3 observations with |CWRES|&gt;6 were excluded from the dataset. The PK-PD parameter in the final model with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect is: K PD = 0.000277*(1+1.4*RAC Asian )

## Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)

The PK-PD response model with KPD 1st ordered rate constant (ie, slope) on Kin appeared to be the most parsimonious model with successful minimization, lower OFV, and lower eta shrinkage which met the diagnostic criteria and therefore was selected as the base model. The correlation between the eta values for BASE and Kout, BASE and KPD, and Kout and KPD were considered weak (- 0.27, -0.27, and 0.32, respectively); hence, a full block or partial block model was not included in the base model for

The correlations between the eta values for BASE and MTT, BASE and Emax, BASE and EC50, MTT and Emax, MTT and EC50, Emax and EC50 were considered weak (ie, -0.37, 0.41, -0.49, -0.17, 0.21, 0.37, respectively); hence, a full block or partial omega block was not included in the base model for ANC.  Based  on  extreme  outlier  observation  assessments,  8  observations  with  |CWRES|&gt;6  were excluded  from  the  dataset.  The  PK-PD  parameters  in  the  final  model  (Table  25:  Step  #7)  with significant (α=0.001) covariate effect are shown below:

MTT = 106*(1 -0.152*RAC Asian )

EC50 = 32.7*(1 -0.217*BEC 0 )* (1+0.399*TUM Solid )*(AGE/55) 0.571

## Target Tumors Sum of Longest Diameters

A  sequential  indirect  response  (IDR)  PK-PD  model,  with  a  tolerance  function  on  Kout  and  an  Emax effect  function  on  Kin,  was  used  as  the  initial  model  and  was  selected  as  the  base  model.  The correlation between the eta values for BASE and Kout, BASE and EC50, BASE and Ktol, Kout and EC50, Kout and Ktol, EC50 and Ktol were considered to be weak (0.083, -0.10, -0.22, respectively); hence, a full block or partial block model was not included in the base model for SLD. Based on each extreme outlier observation assessments, 1 observation with |CWRES|&gt;6 was excluded from the dataset.

The key PK-PD parameters with significant covariates in the final model are shown below:

The  ordered  categorical  regression  model  with  KPD  1st  ordered  rate  constant  (ie,  slope)  on  BASE appeared to be the only model with successful minimization with acceptable relative standard errors for  the  parameter  estimates  and  therefore  was  selected  as  the  base  model.  The  observed  and predicted  probability  of  worst  grades  ≥1  (ie,  all  grades),  ≥2,  and  ≥3  have  indicated  concordance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PK-PD Trial Simulations in Pediatric and Adult Patients with GIST

## Predicted PK, Safety, and Efficacy Profiles at 15 mg/m2 in Children 6-11 Years, 12-17 years, and in Adult Patients with GIST Based on Final PK-PD Models

Based on the final population PK and PK-PD models established, trial simulations were carried out to provide predictions with respect to PK, safety, and efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric patients with GIST (age  groups  6-11  [n(number  of  patients)=210]  and  12-17  years  [n=210])  in  comparison  to  adult patients with GIST [n=210]. In the pediatric age groups, children received doses ranging from 6.25 mg up to 50 mg on Schedule 4/2 whereas adults only received 50 mg doses on Schedule 4/2. A total of 20 trial simulations were run in which the pediatric arms consisted of pediatric patients, assigned demographics comparable to those for children growth statistics and for pediatric GIST; whereas, the comparator arm consisted of adult patients, assigned demographics consistent with those from dataset for adult patients with GIST. Subsequently, based on the simulated body size demographics, children within each age group who had received doses of 15 mg/m2 (ie, ≥12.5 mg/m2 and &lt;17.5 mg/m2) were  subsetted  and  the  predicted  PK  and  PD  profiles  were  compared  to  those  from  adults.  The simulated median profiles for safety (ALT, ANC, AST, BP, HGB, LVEF, lymphocyte count, and platelet count)  and  efficacy  (SLD)  endpoints  based  on  the  pooled  data  from  all  trials  have  been  displayed below:

Baseline was set to the final model population BASE mean value for comparison of predicated relative changes of each endpoint across different age groups; median (95% CI) represents median (2.5%ile, 97.5%ile); sunitinib s ( ) o  s ( ) and 24 hrs post dose on Day 27 of Cycle 6.

ePharm Folder ID 694966: Run 7.

Subsequently, additional trial simulations were run using the predicted average sunitinib concentrations in each age group and assuming 40% intersubject variability to predict the probability of incidence of adverse events HFS, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue in pediatric patient age groups and in adults with GIST based on the final PK-PD models for each endpoint. The simulation results clearly indicate 47-48% lower sunitinib plasma exposures in both pediatric groups in comparison to adults

## Predicted PK, Safety, and Efficacy Profiles Janeway/Agaram Patient Population and in Adult Patients with GIST Based on Final PK-PD Models

Based  on  the  final  population  PK  and  PK-PD  models  established,  for  each  endpoint,  additional  trial simulations were carried out to provide predictions with respect to PK, safety, and efficacy of sunitinib in  a  typical  age  and  gender  group  pediatric  patient  population  as  those  from  studies  conducted  by Janeway et al and Agaram et al studies administered either the starting dose (ie, 25-50 mg; ~ 25 mg/m2) or the maximum dose (ie, 25-50 mg; ~ 30 mg/m2) within those studies. A total of 200 trial simulations were run in which the pediatric arm consisted of pediatric patients (n=11) with the same demographics as those in Janeway et al and Agaram et al studies receiving the initial starting doses and the comparator arm included adult patients (n=11) with GIST all receiving 50 mg on Schedule 4/2. Subsequently, another set of 200 trial simulations were run in which the pediatric arm received the maximum doses instead of the starting doses from the Janeway et al and Agaram et al studies. The simulated median profiles for safety (ALT, ANC, AST, BP, HG, LVEF, lymphocyte count, and platelet count)  and  efficacy  (SLD)  based  on  the  pooled  data  from  all  trials  with  pediatric  patients  receiving starting doses have been displayed below:

Baseline was set to the final model population BASE mean value for comparison of predicated relative changes of each endpoint across different age groups; median (95% CI) represents median (2.5%ile, 97.5%ile); sunitinib average concentration median (95% CI) represents mean of median (2.5%ile, 97.5%ile) values at 0, 3, 6. 9, 12, and 24 hrs post dose on Day 27 of Cycle 6. ePharm Folder ID 694966: Rum 8.

Subsequently, additional trial simulations were run using the predicted average sunitinib concentrations in each age group and assuming 40% intersubject variability to predict the probability of incidence of adverse events HFS, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue in pediatric patient age groups and in adults with GIST based on the final PK-PD models for each endpoint. The results clearly indicate that sunitinib plasma exposures were higher in Janeway and Agaram patients dosed at their starting doses as compared to pediatric patients with GIST dosed at 15 mg/m2 in both pediatric groups, and that the levels in Janeway and Agaram studies although still lower (ie, by 12%) were much closer to those in adult  patients  with  GIST  receiving  50  mg.  Based  on  the  trial  simulations  described  previously,  the predicted  median  (95%  CI)  for  TTP  and  ORR  were  24.8(10.5-42.6)  weeks  and  9.0(0.0-36.0)  %  in Janeway and Agaram pediatric patient population, and were 24.7(12.7-42.6) weeks and 9.0(0.0-27.0) % in adult patients with GIST.

## Population Modeling Analysis Report (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846)

The  effects  of  important  covariates  on  PK  parameters  were  evaluated  using  a  stepwise  covariate selection procedure in which BSA was the only statistically significant covariate (p≤0.001) for CL/F and Vc/F in the final PK models of both sunitinib and SU012662. Other covariates such as age, tumour type (GIST  vs  other  solid  tumours),  race  (Asian  vs  non-  Asian),  baseline  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology

Group (ECOG) performance status (&gt;0 vs 0), Sex (male vs female) were not found to have statistically significant (p&gt;0.001) effects on CL/F or Vc/F.

Based on the final PK models, in a typical paediatric patient with GIST or other solid tumours within the age groups of 2 years to 5 years (median BSA of 0.69 m2), 6 years to 11 years (median BSA of 1.1  m2),  and  12  years  to  17  years  (median  BSA  of  1.6  m2),  the  sunitinib  doses  that  will  lead  to predicted steady- state total plasma exposure over the dosing interval (ie, steady-state AUC24) similar to what have been observed in adults with GIST (1233 ng.hr/mL for sunitinib and 551 ng.hr/mL for SU012662)  at  50  mg  are  25  mg/m2,  22  mg/m2,  and  20  mg/m2  for  sunitinib  and  22  mg/m2,  21 mg/m2, and 20 mg/m2 for SU012662, respectively. Therefore, in paediatric patients with GIST within the age range from 6 years to 17 years, a dose of approximately 20 mg/m2 is expected to provide overall similar extent of total plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite as compared to adults  with  GIST  administered  sunitinib  50  mg  on  Schedule  4/2.  BSA-tiered  dosing  in  children  to achieve steady-state sunitinib and SU012662 AUC observed in adult patients with GIST at the sunitinib dose  of  50  mg  were  predicted  to  be  12.5  mg,  25  mg,  37.5  mg,  50  mg  QD  on  Schedule  4/2  for paediatric patients with BSAs of ≤0.7 m2, 0.8 -1.5 m2, 1.62.4 m2, and ≥2.5 m2, respectively.

## SIMULATIONS

## Predicted Sunitinib AUC and BSA-Tiered Dosing Based on Final Sunitinib PK Model

Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate the expected effect of the significant covariate BSA on sunitinib AUC relative to the reference, an adult patient with GIST at sunitinib dose of 50 mg (sunitinib AUC  of  1233  ng.hr/mL).  This  analysis  showed  that  the  relative  AUC  values  for  a  typical  pediatric patient 6-17 years of age at sunitinib dose of 20 mg/m2 is predicted to be between 75% and 125% of the AUC of the reference.

Furthermore, using the final sunitinib PK model, the doses (in mg) to achieve the steady state 24-hour sunitinib AUC of 1233 ng.hr/mL, observed in adult patients with GIST at the sunitinib dose of 50 mg, were  calculated  (Table  below).  Subsequently,  based  on  the  calculated  dose  and  the  commercially available sunitinib dose levels (i.e., 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg), sunitinib BSA-tiered dosing in children was determined.

There  was  a  great  overlap  in  the  BSA-tiered  dosing  brackets  based  on  the  metabolite  exposure  as compared to the sunitinib exposure; however, in cases where there were differences in the determined tiered dose, the preference was given to the tiered dose determination based on sunitinib considering that the plasma exposure to sunitinib was much larger than that of the metabolite.

## Modelling underestimation of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties exposures

Assuming  an  approximate  15%  underestimation  of  SimCYP  exposures  (average  total  drug  AUC24 underestimation,  SimCYP  Report  Section  4),  the  revised  projected  doses  based  on  SimCYP  (ie,  19 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 21 mg/m2 for 12-17 years instead of 22 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 25 mg/m2 for 12-17 years) would be even closer to the dose of 20 mg/m2 (ie, within approximately 5% instead  of  25%)  and  remain  consistent  with  and  confirming  the  dose  determined  by  the  integrated population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by  SimCYP approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis.

b.50-mg dose equivalent to 30 mg/m².

The exposure of sunitinib decreases with the increase of age for the 3 paediatric age groups, and the exposure of SU012662 increases with the increase of age for the 3 paediatric age groups.

The MAH conducted additional simulations with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage and compared to the observed pediatric data. As the observed pediatric data were at 15 mg/m2 daily dosage, the observed exposure parameters  were  dose  corrected  to  20  mg/m2  for  comparison  purpose.  The  tables  below  show clinically  observed  dose-corrected  and  SimCYP-predicted  sunitinib  and  SU012662  pharmacokinetic parameter estimates in pediatrics in Study ADVL0612 (3-21 years old), Study ACNS1021 (3-19 years old), and Study A6181196 (13-16 years old) after a multiple 20-mg/m2 daily oral dose of sunitinib, respectively.    Overall,  the  ratios  of  the  predicted  versus  observed  dose-corrected  exposure  values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were essentially the same as the ones obtained with the dose of 15 mg/m2 (SimCYP Report Section 4), which is not unexpected considering the doselinearity in the PK model.

## 6.3. Discussion

In  the  PK-PD  analysis  of  Sunitinib  in  Patients  with  GIST  (PMAREQDD-A618w-Other-366)  paediatric data  from  only  1  clinical  study  have  been  included  in  the  dataset  (study  ADVL0612).  In  this  study patients with solid tumours have been enrolled, but the MAH stated that for efficacy PK-PD analyses only studies of patients with GIST were used. ADVL0612 study data for the PK/PD model were included only for safety endpoints. The descriptive statistics for the subjects baseline characteristics from study ADVL0612 have not been provided, however it has been found in the study report body submitted for a previous variation application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering that tumour type is a covariate for lymphocyte count and platelet count, and the impact of the different tumour type on PK-PD relationship has not been evaluated, the reliability of efficacy and safety  predictions  through  trials  simulation  is  questioned,  but  this  issue  will  not  be  pursued  being efficacy and safety analysis out of the scope of the present variation.

The  popPK  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846)  analysis  has  confirmed  the  importance  of  the  BSA  as covariate on CL/F and Vc/F for both sunitinib and its active metabolite, as observed also in previous studies, i.e. ACNS1021 and ADVL0612. MAH's conclusions include the following: respective BSA-tiered doses of 12 .5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg QD on Schedule 4/2 for pediatric patients with BSA of ≤0.7, 0.8 to 1.2, 1.6 to 2.4, and ≥2.5 m2 are predicted to provide plasma exposures to sunitinib comparable with those  observed  in  adult  patients  with  GIST  treated  with  a  dose  of 50  mg/day  on  Schedule  4/2. However the figure reporting the ratio of predicted AUC values related to the values in adult reference following multiple dosing of sunitinib 20 mg/m2 showed that, for paediatric patients with BSA values &lt; 1.1 m 2 , the ratio is lower that 75%; therefore for this patient population the MAH's conclusion cannot be supported. Considering the above, a reference also to BSA values in the proposed text on SmPC has been added.

Regarding  the  PBPK  model,  except  for  the  AUC0-8  values  for  study  A6181196,  the  results  of  the external  validation  show  that  the  predicted/observed  ratios  for  all  the  other  parameters  for  both sunitinib and its active metabolite are &lt;1, indicating that all the predicted values are minor compared to the observed values. This lead to conclude that the model predicts with an (slightly) underestimation the exposure  of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties. Based on SimCYP, the revised projected dose, assuming an approximate 15% of SimCYP exposure, remains consistent with  dose  determined  by  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Moreover  all  the simulated  exposure  measures  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  done  following  15mg/m2  daily  oral administration  of  sunitinib,  however  the  proposed  dosage  to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  is  20mg/m2 daily.    As  the  observed  pediatric  data  were  at  15  mg/m2  daily  dosage,  the  observed  exposure parameters were dose corrected to 20 mg/m2 for comparison purpose and an additional simulation with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage and compared to the observed pediatric data.  The ratios of the predicted versus observed dose-corrected exposure values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were very closed to the ones obtained with the dose of 15 mg/m2.

Based on the information provided at the RSI, the difference between the initial population PK analysis (pooled  data  from  adult  and  paediatric  patients)  and  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (only paediatric data) is the inclusion of Tumor type as covariate on CL/F. In the first analysis it resulted to be  significant,  in  the  second  one  not.  The  integrated  population  PK  analysis  was  selected  as  final analysis to be used to calculate the dose in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2.

However, data from the phase I study ADVL0612 identified the 15 mg/m2/day as the sunitinib MTD in paediatric subjects without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation. As stated by the MAH  in  the  RSI,  the  MTD  projection  in  ADVL0612  study  was  done  in  heavily  pretreated  pediatric patients  mainly  with  CNS  tumors.  In  addition,  the  starting  dose  in  both  clinical  trial  A6181196  and ACNS1021 was 15 mg/m 2  (based on the MTD) with the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity. Further, the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was higher than 20 mg/m 2 . The information that children treated in clinical trials/in case series received starting  or  average  daily  doses  of  20  mg/m 2 is  not  emerging  from  the  SmPC,  therefore  it  appears somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 mg/m 2 , and that 20 mg/m 2  is the dose in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST.  As per CHMP request, the MAH modified the SmPC section 5.2 to describe the dosages of Sutent received by pediatric patients in the clinical experience, in order to clarify the apparent contradiction between MTD

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and wording on 20 mg/m 2 .

## 7. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 7.1. Study A6181196

Study A6181196 was evaluated within EMA/H/C/000687/P46-053 procedure. A summary of key study results is presented below.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  multinational,  Phase  1/2  clinical  trial evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children diagnosed with advanced unresectable GIST.

Patient eligibility: Eligible patients were ≥6 and &lt; 21 years of age, with histological diagnosis of GIST with  non-mutant  KIT  and  demonstrated  disease  progression  or  intolerance  to  imatinib  mesylate  or could not obtain imatinib in their country.

Treatment: The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2  per day administrated orally on Schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment) for a maximum of 18 cycles, which was lower than the approved 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 dosing regimen in adults. The starting dose was based  on  the  Phase  1  study  ADVL0612  conducted  in  patients  with  solid  tumor  aged  2-21  years. Intrapatient dose escalation of sunitinib was allowed after completion of Cycle 1.

Objectives/endpoints:  primary  objective  was  to  characterize  PK  profile  of  sunitinib  and  its  active metabolite  SU012662  in  children  and  young  adults  with  advanced  unresectable  GIST,  primary endpoints were The primary study endpoints were the PK parameters [including AUC24 (total plasma exposure  [AUC  from  0  to  24  hrs])  and  oral  clearance  (CL/F)].  Secondary  objectives  were  whether doses greater than the established paediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were tolerated, safety and antitumor  activity,  PK-PD  relationships,  in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST.  Among  the  secondary endpoints, ORR, DOR, PFS and OS were collected.

No interim analysis was planned in this study.

Sample  size:  The  sample  size  was  reduced  from  the  originally  planned  15  patients  to  6  patients because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  difficulties  in  identifying  pediatric  patients  suitable  for participation in the study. The revised sample size was expected to still allow characterization of the PK profile, ie, analysis of the primary endpoint.

## Results

Study A6181196 started on 12 June 2012 and was completed on 21 August 2017.

Patient  disposition:  A  total  of  6  patients  aged  13  to  16  years  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  were included in the analysis of PK, safety, and efficacy (see table below).

For patient #10521002 best response was determined based on the CT PET scans at baseline.

ORR: CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1

PFS: time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of objective tumour progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred firs

Since none of the study patients experienced CR or PR, an analysis of the DOR was not performed. There were no deaths in the study population. Consequently, all patients were censored, and OS was not  summarized  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  The  time  from  the  first  study  dose  to  the  last available survival follow-up time ranged from 0.9 years to 2.4 years for the 6 patients.

## 7.2. Case series Reports

Retrospective analyses of medical records from paediatric and young adult patients with GIST treated with sunitinib from 3 case-series publications have been identified and presented by the MAH (Agaram et al. 2008 1 , Janeway et al. 2009 2 , Rutkowski et al. 2017 3 ), for a total of 20 paediatric patients.

## Methods - analysis of data submitted, and Results

## Agram et al (2008)

This publication concerns a clinic-biological study of 17 patients with a diagnosis of GIST who were 18 years  of  age  or  younger  that  were  identified  from  the  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center database.

Among them, 4 patients received sunitinib treatment ,  after  failure  of  or  intolerance  to imatinib. Patient's age was 10-18 years.

Patients  were  assessed  by  CT/PET  according  to  local  standard  practice,  and  the  overall  tumour assessment evaluations were reported.

The  major  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  tumour  samples  with  adult  patients'  samples regarding KIT or PDGFRα mutations and pathway activation, as well as in vitro sensitivity to TKIs.

Neither precise data on tumour assessment at baseline, nor precise scheme of dosing were available for all patients (Schedule 4/2 or continuous daily dosing schedule).

PR,  SD  and  PD  was  achieved  by  one  patient  each.  No  data  on  tumor  response  is  available  for  one patient who developed sunitinib intolerance after one month and could not resume therapy (see table below).

## Janeway et al (2009)

This publication describes 7 paediatric patients ,  6  of  which  with  confirmed  metastatic  or  relapsed GIST that were treated with sunitinib within the Expanded Access Program (Pfizer A6181036 protocol) after previous failure to imatinib. Patient's age was 10-17 years.

Six out of seven patients had available disease measure by CT at the time of enrolment. Response to prior imatinib therapy was SD in 3 patients and PD in 3 patients. All patients had been off prior therapy for over 2 weeks when sunitinib was started.

For the 6 patients with evaluable data on dose, the mean starting dose was 24.6 mg/m 2  (range 17.734.2). In 3 out of 6 patients the dose was increased (range 29.9-40.4 mg/m 2 ). In 2 patients where dose was increased to 40.4 and 30.9 mg/m 2  respectively, the dose had to be decreased ultimately because  of  AE.  The  mean  cumulative  daily  dose  (the  mean  daily  dose  over  all  cycles)  on  this  4/2 schedule was 26.8 mg/m 2 /d (range 17-6-34.1 mg/m 2 ).

One  patient  had  a  PR  (resolution  of  lung  metastasis),  5 patients  SD,  and  1 patient  showed  PD  on sunitinib therapy (see table below). The duration of PR or SD was 7 - &gt;21 months, with an average of 15 months. In 5 out of 6 patients with SD/PR, sunitinib resulted in a longer TTP than was achieved during  imatinib  treatment,  difference  in  TTP  ranging  from  2  to  17  months.  Two  patients  with  SD showed a significant reduction in tumour metabolic activity on FDG-PET imaging.

## Rutkowski et al (2017)

This  publication  describes 9  paediatric/young  adult  patients ,  aged  11-21  years,  with  GIST  and treated with sunitinib. Those patients were identified from clinical records from 2 centers in Europe and 1 center in the US.

There were no mutations in neither KIT nor PDGFRα for any patient.

Before being treated with sunitinib, 8 patients were treated with surgery and 8 patients did receive imatinib. On imatinib, all but one patient had SD as the best response, and 8 out of 9 patients had documented PD.

Sunitinib dosing regimens varied with 5 patients treated with Schedule 4/2 using a standard approved dosage of 50 mg/day while other patients received 37.5 mg/day in an alternative continuous regimen. Four patients started with Schedule 4/2 and moved to continuous dosing, mostly because of AEs. The mean treatment duration was 23 months (range 1-&gt;73). Two patients were still on therapy as per data cut-off of 20 February 2016 (&gt;42 and &gt; 73 months).

The objective response of GIST to sunitinib therapy was evaluated with serial CT scans  (performed every  2-3  months)  according  to  RECIST.  In  accordance  with  the  PDCO  request,  the  raw  data  on tumour  measurements  for  4  of  the  patients  included  in  this  publication  have  been  retrospectively collected.

A best response of SD was observed in 7 of the 9 patients on sunitinib treatment (see table below). All but 1 patient eventually had PD. Among the 8 patients who progressed, PFS and TTP duration ranged from 1 to 28 months, while 1 patient remained progression free after 73 months (as per date of data cut-off). Overall, median PFS was 15 months.

FU in this publication ranged from 25 months to 260 months. At the time of data cut off, 8 patients remained alive with disease (AWD), with 2 being still treated with sunitinib, 4 are being treated with other targeted agents, and 2 patients have stopped treatment. One patient died of disease during the course of therapy.

## 7.3. Discussion - Clinical Efficacy

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are rare mesenchymal tumours that arise in the gastrointestinal  tract  (stomach  in  60%  of  the  cases),  more  often  occurring  in  the  adult  ageing population. Paediatric patients with GIST represent an even rarer sub population (1%-2% of all GIST cases),  presenting  a  different  clinical  behavior  and  biology  than  typical  adult  GIST.  Paediatric  GIST patients tend to be predominantly female, with a median age at diagnosis in most series of 14 years. Mutations  in  KIT  or  PDGFRá  are  uncommon,  negative  immunohistochemistry  for  any  of  the  SDHproteins are common (SDH-B mostly). Despite multiple recurrences and lack of dramatic responses to TKI therapy, most paediatric patients survive with active disease for many years, suggesting a more indolent clinical course than observed with adult GIST. Pediatric patients with metastatic WT GIST can survive  as  long  as  15  years  from  the  development  of  metastatic  disease  (Mullassery  et  al  2016 4 ,

Janeway et al 2012 5 ).

There is currently no consensus in the paediatric oncology expert community on which compound to use in  metastatic  disease  or  recurrent  tumours:  systemic  treatment  with  TKI  is  recommended.  The choice  of  which  compound  to  use  is  under  debate  and  depends  on  the  presence  of  mutations  and clinical factors.

In  adult  patients  with  GIST,  Sutent  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  and/or metastatic malignant disease after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance or intolerance.

The  MAH  has  presented  the  results  of  the  clinical  study  A6181196  of  sunitinib  in  pediatric  GIST patients. In addition, data coming from three case series have been provided.

## Study A6181196

Study A6181196 was a single-arm, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children and young adults diagnosed with  advanced  unresectable  GIST.  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  characterization  of  PK profile.

A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients aged 6-16 years (median 14.0 years) were enrolled  in  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  analysis  of  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy.  Patients demonstrated disease progression or intolerance to imatinib mesylate or could not obtain imatinib in their country. All patients had no detectable alterations in KIT and PDGFRα .

The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, based on previously identified MTD in children (in phase I study ADVL0612), for up to 18 cycles (24 months). Intra-patient dose escalation was allowed after completion of Cycle 1, not to exceed 50 mg/day. The dose was increased to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients. Dose reduction due to an AE is reported in one patient (see safety).

Patients  were  to  be  followed  for  OS  until  either  2  years  from  the  first  dose  of  the  study  drug  or completion of 18 cycles of study treatment.

In  study  A6181196,  there  were  no  confirmed  objective  responses.  SD  was  reported  in  3  (50%) patients,  and  objective  disease  progression  was  observed  in  3  patients  (50%).  Since  none  of  the patients experienced a CR or PR, an analysis of DOR was not performed.

PFS events were reported in 4 (66.7%) patients, for an estimated median PFS of 5.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, NR).

No deaths were reported after a follow-up survival period ranging from 0.9 to 2.4 years, therefore all patients were censored, and OS was not summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.

## Case series reports

The efficacy results from the 6 paediatric patients with GIST treated with sunitinib in Study A6181196 were supported by published efficacy results from 20 sunitinib-treated paediatric or young adult patients with GIST retrieved in literature. Nearly all of whom were previously treated with imatinib.

In the publication by Agram et al (2008) , 4 patients aged 10-18 years with wild type KIT and PDGFRá GIST received sunitinib treatment after failure of or intolerance to imatinib. Overall tumour assessment evaluations  according  to  local  standard  practice  were  reported,  although  neither  precise  data  on tumour assessment at baseline, nor precise scheme of dosing were available for all patients. PR, SD and PD was achieved by one patient each. No data on tumor response is available for one patient who developed sunitinib intolerance after one month and could not resume therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the publication by Janeway et al (2009) , 7 paediatric patients aged 10-17 years (6 of which with confirmed metastatic or relapsed GIST that were treated with sunitinib within the Expanded Access Program after previous failure to imatinib) , are described. Five of them had wild type KIT and PDGFRα GIST, while data is not available for the other two patients. For the 6 patients with evaluable data on dose, the mean starting dose was 24.6 mg/m 2  (range 17.7-34.2). In 3 out of 6 patients the dose was increased (range 29.9-40.4 mg/m 2 ), and in 2 of them the dose had to be decreased ultimately because of AE. One patient had a PR (resolution of lung metastasis) and 5 patients SD, and 1 patient showed PD for a duration of PR/SD of 7 - &gt;21 months (average 15 months). In 5 out of 6 patients with SD/PR, sunitinib  resulted  in  a  longer  TTP  than  was  achieved  during  imatinib  treatment.  One  patient experienced PD as best overall response.

In the publication by Rutkowski et al (2017) , 9 paediatric/young adult patients, aged 11-21 years, with wild  type  KIT  and  PDGFRá  GIST,  are  described.  Eight  patients  did  receive  imatinib  before  sunitinib. Five  patients  were  treated  with  sunitinib  50  mg/day  on  schedule  4/2,  while  other  patients  received 37.5 mg/day in an alternative continuous regimen. Four patients started with Schedule 4/2 and moved to continuous dosing, mostly because of AEs. Seven patients experienced SD and 2 patients had PD as best response. One patient died of disease during the course of therapy. All but one patients having SD, eventually experienced PD. PFS and TTP duration ranged from 1 to 28 months, while 1 patient remained progression free after 73 months (as per date of data cut-off). Overall, median PFS is 15 months. At the time of the data cut-off, two patients were still receiving sunitinib.

The starting dose of sunitinib in the two case series that include data on dosage (i.e. Janeway and Rutkowski) appered higher compared to the RP2D of 15 mg/m 2  identified in the ADVL0612 Phase 1 study.

Of note, the 2 partial responses reported in literature (one in Agram et al, described as resolution of liver metastases, and one in Janeway et al, reported as resolution of lung metastases) were considered by  the  MAH  as  SDs,  in  the  absence  of  raw  data  and/or  confirmation  by  RECIST.  Therefore,  taking together,  evidence  from  Study  A6181196  and  the  3  case-series  indicated  that  sunitinib  treatment resulted  in  disease  stabilization  in  18  of  26  (69.2%)  paediatric  or  young  adult  patients  with  GIST, either after imatinib failure or intolerance (16 out of 21, 76%), or de novo/after surgery (2 out of 5, 40%).

Due to the lack of objective confirmed radiological responses, the limited number of patients in the clinical trial, the intrinsic limitation of retrospective case series, along with the very indolent nature of GIST in paediatric patients, it is considered that the available evidence are not conclusively supporting the clinical activity of sunitinib in children with GIST.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

The MAH presented safety data for sunitinib in children with refractory solid tumours, supported by the 3  clinical  studies  performed  in  paediatric  patients  (see  table  below).  No  combined  or  integrated analyses of safety across studies were planned or performed due to different disease type, different treated populations and the different dosing regimens studied. Overall, safety data from 70 paediatric patients have been reported in the submitted dossier.

## 8.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Study A6181196 , Study ADVL0612 , and Study ACNS1021 were  included  in  the  evaluation  of  safety.  In  all  the  3  studies,  safety  endpoints included  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  deaths,  laboratory  evaluations,  vital signs, concomitant medication use, and electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram results.

In Study ACNS1021, Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, and deaths were actively collected during the study. Although not required by the protocol, Grade &lt;3 AEs may also have been reported.  All reported AEs (any grade) were included in the AE summaries.

All AEs (serious and non-serious) that occurred on or after the first day of study treatment and up to 28 days after the last sunitinib dose for Studies A6181196 and ADVL0612 and up to 30 days for Study ACNS1021 were considered as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs).

All AEs were coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 20.0 in Studies A6181196 and ACNS1021, and Version 15.1 in Study ADVL0612. Intensity (severity) of the AEs was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  4.0  in  all  3  studies.  Haematology  and  blood  chemistry data were graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 severity grade, if applicable.

In Study ADVL0612, in addition to the AEs, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were also evaluated as described below:

## 1) Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)

DLT is  defined  as  any  of  the  following  events  that  are  possibly,  probably  or  definitely  attributed  to sunitinib:

- -Non-Hematological Dose-Limiting Toxicity:
1. Any Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity.
2. Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exception of:
- Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of &lt;3 days duration despite appropriate anti -emetic administration.
- Grade 3 ALT or AST that resolved to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days of study drug interruption and that did not recur upon re-challenge with study drug.  Note: For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT was defined as 45 U/L.
- Grade 3 bilirubin that resolved to Grade ≤ 2 within 7 days of study drug interruption and that did not recur upon re-challenge with study drug.
- Grade 3 fever or infection of &lt;5 days duration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Grade  3  hypophosphatemia,  hypokalemia,  hypocalcemia,  or  hypomagnesemia  responsive  to oral supplementation.
- Asymptomatic Grade 3 elevations in amylase or lipase that resolved to Grade &lt;1 within 7 days of study drug interruption and that did not recur upon re challenge with study drug.
3. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50 -40%, shortening fraction &lt;24 -15%, or an absolute decrease in shortening fraction of 8% points from baseline.
4. Grade 2 allergic  reactions  that  necessitated  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  not  considered  a DLT.
5. A BP &gt;25 mmHg above the 95% for age, height, and gender confirmed by repeated measurement was dose-limiting.
6. In patients on antihypertensive therapy, a persistently elevated BP, but ≤ 25 mmHg above the 95% for age, height, and gender for &gt;14 days was dose-limiting.
7. Any Grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that persisted for ≥ 7 days and was considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that it required treatment interruption.
8. Any  AE  that  required  interruption  of  study  drug  for  &gt;7  days  or  which  recurred  upon  drug re-challenge.
- -Hematological Dose Limiting Toxicity:

Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;25,000/mm3) or Grade 4 neutropenia.

## 2) Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)

The MTD was the maximum dose at which fewer than 1/3 of patients experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 of therapy. In the event that 2 DLTs were observed out of 6 evaluable patients, but were of different classes  of  adverse  effects  (e.g.,  hepatotoxicity  and  myelosuppression),  expansion  of  the  cohort  to 12 patients was considered if all of the following conditions were met:

- One of the DLTs did not appear to be related to dose (i.e., for at least 1 DLT, the same adverse effect,  attributed  to  study  drug,  was  not  previously  experienced  at  a  lower  dose  level  1 increment below [in CTCAE grade or duration] the DLT definition).
- The adverse effect was readily reversible.
- The study chair, statistician, committee chair or vice chair, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP),  and  Investigational  New  Drug  sponsor  all  agreed  that  expansion  of  the  cohort  was acceptable.

If  less  than  1/3  of  patients  in  the  expanded  cohort  experienced  dose-limiting  toxicities,  the  dose escalation proceeded.

For  Study ADVL0612,  additional  reporting  requirement  included  Secondary  Acute  Myeloid  Leukemia (AML)/ Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

## 8.2. Results

Exposure:  A  total  of  70  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study medication in Studies A6181196 (6 patients), ADVL0612 (35 patients), and ACNS1021 (29 patients). Summary tables for each study are presented below:

a. Actual Cumulative Dose is actual total dose taken in the cycle.

- b.  Relative Dose Intensity (%) is defined as Actual Dose Intensity (per week)/Intended Dose Intensity (per week)*100%, where Actual Dose Intensity (per week) is defined as Actual Total Dose in cycle/Actual number of weeks in cycle, and  Intended Dose Intensity is based on the prescribed dose at the cycles.
2. c . Average daily dose calculated as administered, excluding the 2-week off period.

In  study  A6181196,  the  starting  dose  of  sunitinib  was  15  mg/m2  per  day  administered  orally  per Schedule  4/2  (MTD  previously  defined);  intra-patient  dose  escalation  of  sunitinib  was  allowed  after completion of Cycle 1. The dose was increased to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients. Dose reduction due to an AE is reported in one patient (see below).

Includes data up to 28 days after last dose of study drug.

All AEs were considered as treatment-emergent AEs, unless present at baseline with the same severity grade. CTCAE version 4.0 was used.  Maximum CTCAE grade is defined as the maximum CTCAE grade value for the specific Preferred Term.  MedDRA (version 20.0) coding dictionary applied.

Abbreviations: AE=adverse event, CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N=number of patients analyzed; n=number of patients with an event; SAE=serious adverse event.

In study A6181196, the majority of the reported AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Three patients had 1 Grade 3 AE each, and 2 patients had 1 Grade 4 AE each. There were no reports of Grade 5 TEAEs. Overall, Headache (Grades 1 or 2) was reported in 4 (66.7%) patients and Diarrhoea (Grades 1 or 2), Nausea (Grade 1), Neutropenia (Grades 2 to 4), or white blood cell (WBC) count decreased (Grade 2) were reported in 3 patients each, respectively. Hepatic hematoma and Intra-abdominal hemorrhage TEAEs (Grade 4) were reported in 1 patient. Both of these events were determined by the Investigator to be related to disease progression. This conclusion was supported by laparotomy showing multiple lesions localized  at  stomach  wall,  liver,  lymph  node  at  falx  hepatis,  and  massive  peritoneal dissemination, with hemorrhagic ascites. The other Grade 4 TEAE was Neutropenia that was reported in 1 patient and led to dose reduction. Grade 3 TEAEs reported were Hypoglycaemia, Hypophosphataemia, Neutropenia, and Thrombocytopenia.

## Deaths:

Study A6181196 : no deaths were reported.

Study ADVL0612 : A total of 5 patients died during Part A of the study due to the disease under study (1  patient  in  the  15  mg/m2  and  4  in  the  20  mg/m2  dose  group)  and  none  of  the  deaths  were considered to be related to study treatment.

A total of 5 patients died during Part B of the study due to the disease under study (3 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 and 2 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m2 dose group). One patient (a 6-years old girl  with  diffuse-pontine  glioma)  in  20  mg/m2  group  also  experienced  Grade  5  Aspiration.  The investigator assessed the causality of aspiration as possibly related to sunitinib stating the AE played a minor contribution to death, and the causality of the death was reported as the disease under study (Malignant glioma). The other deaths were not considered related to study treatment.

A total of 5 patients died during the Part C of the study due to the disease under study and none of the deaths were considered to be related to study treatment.

Study ACNS1021 : A total of 18 patients died during the study, with 12 (75%) patients in glioma group and 6 (46.2%) patients in ependymoma group. Five (27.8%) patients died during active treatment including up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. All 18 patients died due to the disease under study; none of the deaths were considered to be related to study treatment except for the death of 1 patient (4-years old boy with globlastoma multiforme) for which protocol therapy was considered to  have  had  a  'minor  contribution  to  death'.  The  investigator  stated  that  there  was  reasonable possibility that the reported AE Heamorrhage intracranial grade 4 occurred 13 days before the death was related to product sunitinib based on a plausible temporal association and the known safety profile of the drug. In addition, the AEs Hydrocephalus and Disease progression were unrelated to the study drug sunitinib, but related to deterioration of the underlying glioblastoma multiforme. The progressive disease, which was confirmed by the MRI might have contributed to Haemorrhage intracranial.

## Serious Adverse Events:

Study A6181196 : no SAEs were reported.

Study ADVL0612 :  Overall,  18  patients  (51%)  experienced  SAEs.  A  summary  of  SAEs  is  reported  in table below:

Study ACNS1021 :  Overall,  13  (44.8%) patients in the safety population had all-causality SAEs. The most common ( ≥ 10%) all-causality  SAEs  were  Haemorrhage  intracranial,  Hydrocephalus,  Neoplasm progression,  and  Seizure  (each  reported  for  3  [10.3%]  patients).  The  majority  of  the  SAEs  was associated  with  disease  under  study  and  considered  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  The  SAEs considered  treatment-related  were  intracranial  hemorrhage  (3  patients,  1  grade  1  and  2  grade  3 events) and rash maculo-papular (1 patient, grade 2). Data on SAEs in presented in the table below:

## Permanent discontinuations:

Study A6181196 : one patient was permanently discontinued during cycle 6 due to a treatment-related adverse event of Grade 2 Anaemia that was reported as resolved.

Study ADVL0612 :  overall,  7  patients  (20%)  discontinued  due  to  AEs  related to  study  drug,  and  the event was reported as 'AE unspecified'.

Study ACNS1021 :  two  patients  (7%) discontinued due to intracranial hemorrhage, reported both as SAE and considered related to study drug.

## Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) - Study ADVL0612:

Part A: A total of 6 out of 12 patients experienced DLTs, with 3 (50.0%) patients each in the sunitinib 15 mg/m 2  and 20 mg/m 2  dose groups. One of the first 3 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m 2  dose group had 1 cardiac event (Grade 2 Left ventricular dysfunction) during the first treatment cycle. This dose level was expanded to 6 patients, and 2 other patients reported DLTs in Cycle 1. A Grade 4 Neutrophil count decreased  in 1 patient, and  Grade  3  Fatigue, Weight  decreased, Decreased  appetite, Dehydration,  Hypokalemia  and  Hypophosphatemia  in  1  patient.  The  dose  was  then  reduced  to  15 mg/m 2 . One of the first 3 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m 2  dose group experienced 3 cardiac events (Grade 3 Cardiac failure, Grade 2 Acute coronary syndrome, and Grade 2 Left ventricular dysfunction) during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  The  dose  level  was  expanded  to  6  patients  and  2  other  patients experienced DLTs in Cycle 1 (Grade 3 ALT increased in 1 patient and Grade 3 Hyponatraemia in 1 patient).  The  protocol  was  amended  to  exclude  patients  with  previous  anthracycline  or  cardiac radiation exposure. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined for the Part A population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Part B: A total of 4 out of 11 patients experienced DLTs (2 out of 8 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 group and 2 out of 3 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m 2  dose groups; any cycle DLTs). None of the patients experienced cardiac events. None of the 8 patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m2 dose group had DLTs in Cycle 1. Two patients in the sunitinib 15 mg/m 2  dose group experienced DLTs in subsequent cycles, a Grade 3 nephrolithiasis during Cycle 5 in 1 patient, and Grade 4 Neutrophil count decreased and Grade 2 QT prolongation during Cycle 2 in 1 patient. Two out of 3 patients in the sunitinib 20 mg/m 2  dose group experienced DLTs during the first treatment cycle, a Grade 4 Hyperuricemia in 1 patient, and Grade 4 Haemorrhage intracranial, Grade 4 Vagus nerve disorder, and Grade 5 Aspiration in 1 patient.

## Based  on  Part  B  of  the  study,  The  MTD  and  the  RP2D  for  sunitinib  in  children  without previous  cardiac  radiation  or  anthracycline  exposure  was  15  mg/m2  QD  for  28  days followed by 14 days off treatment.

Part C : A total of 6 out of 12 patients experienced DLTs (any cycle) in the sunitinib 15 mg/m 2  dose group.    None  of  the  patients  experienced  cardiac  events.  In  the  first  treatment  cycle,  3  patients experienced  DLTs,  a  Grade  4  Haemorrhage  intracranial  and  Hypoxia  in  1  patient;  Grade  3  Palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in 1 patient; and Grade 3 Back pain and Dizziness in 1 patient. In Part C, there were 3 out of 12 patients with Cycle 1 DLT (25%) which was below the threshold of 33% for  Cycle  1  DLT  rate.  DLTs  in  later  cycles  were  captured,  but  not  used  in  determination  of recommended  phase  2  dose  (RP2D).  One  additional  patient  had  Grade  3  Abdominal  pain  and Pneumatosis  intestinalis  during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  Both  these  events  were  reported  as  DLT, though  they  were  considered  unlikely  related  to  the  study  drug.  Two  patients  experienced  DLTs  in subsequent cycles, a Grade 3 Blood alkaline phosphatase increased during Cycle 3 in 1 patient and Grade 3 Proteinuria during Cycle 2 in 1 patient.

## Laboratory and other events:

Study A6181196 : Haemathology: Grade 4 neutrophils (absolute) decreased was reported in 1 (16.7%) patient, and Grade 3 neutrophils (absolute) decreased, platelets decreased, and anemia were reported in  1  (16.7%)  patient  each,  all  of  which  were  also  reported  as  TEAEs.  Grade  2  decrease  in  WBC, decrease  in  neutrophils  (absolute),  and  anaemia  were  reported  in  6  (100%),  4  (66.7%),  and  1 (16.7%) patients, respectively.

Chemistry: The majority of the results were within normal range (shown as Grade 0) or Grade 1 in severity, and there were no Grade 4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities. Grade 3 hypoglycaemia and hypophosphataemia were reported in 1 (16.7%) patient each, both of which were also reported as TEAEs.

Blood pressure: A change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥10 mm Hg was reported in 5 (83.3%) patients and ≥ 20 mm Hg in 3 (50.0%) patients. A change from baseline in systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg was reported in 1 (16.7 %) patient. Overall, the mean changes from baseline in BP during and  at  the  end  of  treatment  were  small  and  not  clinically  meaningful,  as  there  were  no  TEAEs  of Hypertension or BP increased reported in this study.

QTc interval: Overall, mean changes from baseline in QTcB and QTcF interval during and at the end of treatment were small, and none were reported as AEs. Shifts in QTcF interval from Grade 0 (within normal  range)  at  baseline  to  Grade  ≥3  (QTcF  interval  ≥30  msec)  post -baseline  was  reported  in  2 (33.3%) patients.

Study ADVL0612 :  Hematology: laboratory abnormalities were reported in the majority of patients in the safety population. The majority of the events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Three (50.0%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients in the 20 mg/m2 group of Part A and 1 (8.3%) patient in Part C had Grade 3 WBC decreased and anaemia. These events were reported as TEAEs.

Chemistry:  laboratory  test  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  safety analysis  population.  In  Part  A-Total,  hypophosphatemia  and  elevated  lipase  (Grade  3  and  Grade  2, respectively) were reported in 1 (8.3%) patient each. In Part B-Total, hypophosphatemia (Grade 3) was  reported  in  1  (9.1%)  patient,  and  elevated  creatinine  (Grade  2)  was  reported  in  2  (18.2%) patients. In Part C, elevated  lipase  (Grade  2)  was  reported  in  1  (8.3%)  patient.  Grade  3 hypophosphatemia was also reported as TEAEs as described in Study ADVL0612 CSR Table 21 in Part A-Total and in Part B-Total. Grade 2 lipase increased was reported as a TEAE in Part C.

QTc interval: In Part A of the study, 1 (16.7%) patient in the 15 mg/m2 group and 2 (33.3%) patients in the 20 mg/m2 group had maximum increases between 30 msec to 60 msec from baseline in QTc interval.  In Part B of the study, 1 (12.5%) patient in the 15 mg/m2 group had maximum increase between 30 msec to 60 msec from baseline in QTc interval. In Part C of the study, 2 (16.7%) patients in  the  15  mg/m2 group had maximum increase between 30 msec to 60 msec from baseline in QTc interval.

Study ACNS1021 :  Hematology: The majority of patients in both treatment groups had haematology baseline  severities  of  Grade  0  or  Grade  1.    Seven  (7)  patients  had  haematology  laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs. Five patients overall had Grade 3 Neutrophil count decreased; 1 patient had  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prolonged,  and  1  patient  had  Grade  4  Neutrophil  count decreased,  Lymphocyte  count  decreased,  and  Grade  3  WBC  count  decreased.  Neutrophil  count decreased  (Grade  3  in  5  [17.2%]  patients  and  Grade  4  in  1  [3.4%]  patient);  Lymphocyte  count decreased (Grade 4 in 1 [3.4%] patient); and White blood cell count decreased (Grade 3 in 1 [3.4%] patient) were reported as TEAEs.

Chemistry:  The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  had  chemistry  baseline  severities  of Grade 0 or Grade 1. Two patients had Grade 4 hypocalcemia; Grade 3 abnormalities were reported for ALT increased (3 patients), AST increased (2 patients), hypokalemia (1 patient), and elevated lipase (1 patient).

## Safety data from the retrospective case series

Agaram et al (2008): the manuscript does not offer a detailed review of the safety of the 4 patients. One  patient  stopped  sunitinib  treatment  after  1  month.  This  patient,  however,  was  intolerant  to imatinib.    Another  patient  stopped  treatment  after  5  months  due  to  drug  intolerance  and  disease progression. The other 2 patients continued on sunitinib treatment until disease progression.

Janewy  et  al  (2009):  of  the  7  patients  described  (age  ranges  10  to  17  years),  no  Grade  4  or  5 treatment-related AEs were reported. Three Grade 3 events (fatigue, gastrointestinal AEs, haematological) occurred in 2 of 7 patients. These Grade 3 AEs led to dose reductions in 2 patients. Grade 1 or 2 events reported were: fatigue in 3 patients, haematological in 3 patients, gastrointestinal in 4 patients (including abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia or diarrhoea); musculoskeletal events in 4 patients (including creatinine kinase elevation in 1 patient); leg pain in 2 patients, and joint pain in 1 patient. Hair hypopigmentation in 4 patients; headache in 2 patients; hypothyroidism in 2 patients; hepatic dysfunction in 1 patient.

Rutkowski et al (2017): of the 9 patients described (age ranges 11 to 21 years), the majority of AEs were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity.  No  Grade  5  treatment-related  AEs  were  reported.  Grade  3  AEs (cholecystitis  [n=1],  hypothyroidism  and  anaemia  [n=1],  fatigue,  mucositis  and  diarrhoea  [n=1]) occurred in 3 patients. Two patients permanently discontinued treatment due to Grade 1/2 AEs (Grade

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2  abdominal/bone  pain  and  fatigue  [n=1],  Grade  2  oedema  and  Grade  1  fatigue,  epistaxis,  and headache [n=1]), and 2 patients required dose reduction. Most AEs experienced by patients treated with sunitinib were manageable and reversible after dose adjustments.

## Post-marketing data

Use in paediatric patients is monitored and discussed in each PSUR. As of 30 April 2017, no new safety signals  with  regards  to  paediatric  use  have  been  identified.  Estimated  post-marketing  exposure  in children and adolescents under 18 years old is not available. During the 01 May 2016 through 30 April 2017 interval, there were 43 cases which reported the use of sunitinib in the paediatric population. The most  common  AEs  (≥2)  in  paediatric  patients  included  the  following  PTs:  Disease progression  (4), Fatigue, GIST, and Headache (2 each). These events are listed in the sunitinib SmPC or are consistent with progression of the underlying malignancy.

## 8.3. Discussion

A  total  of  70 paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  received  at  least  1 dose  of  study  medication  in Studies A6181196 (6 patients), ADVL0612 (35 patients), and ACNS1021 (29 patients) were included in the evaluation of safety. Data have been presented separately for each study: the MAH did not present pooled analyses due to different disease type, different treated populations and the different dosing regimens studied.

The majority of patients in all 3 studies were white, with a prevalence of female in studies A6181196 and ADVL0612, while more male were enrolled in ACNS1021 study. Mean age was 14.3 years (SD 1.4, range 13-16) in A6181196 study, 12 years (range 3-21) in ADVL0612 study, and 11.5 years (SD 4.6, range 3-19) in ACNS1021 study.

Study ADVL0612: This is a phase I study to determine the MTD of sunitinib in children with refractory solid tumours when given on the recommended adult schedule 4/2.

During the initial portion of the study (Part A, 20 mg/m2), 1 of first 3 subjects experienced 1 cardiac event during the first treatment cycle. This dose level was expanded to 6 subjects and 2 other subjects reported DLTs in Cycle 1. The dose was then reduced to 15 mg/m2. One subjects in this dose group experienced  3  cardiac  events  during  the  first  treatment  cycle.  Therefore,  due  to  cardiac  DLTs,  the protocol was amended to exclude subjects with previous anthracycline or cardiac radiation exposure, which were not enrolled in the subsequent Part B of the study, and no further cardiac events occurred in part B. No MTD was defined for Part A population. None of the 8 subjects in the Part B sunitinib 15 mg/m2 dose group had DLTs in Cycle 1. The dose was escalated to 20 mg/m2 with 2 out of first 3 subjects experiencing DLTs during the first treatment cycle. These results established 15 mg/m2 per day  on  schedule  4/2  as  the  MTD  for  subjects  without  previous  cardiac  radiation  or  anthracycline exposure (which was lower as compared to adults, i.e. 15 mg/m 2  versus 30 mg/m 2 ). During Part C of the study (sunitinib 15 mg/m2, with sunitinib capsule contents sprinkled over applesauce or yogurt), 4 out of 12 enrolled subjects experienced DLTs in the first treatment cycle.

A total of 35 patients were enrolled in this study: across the three Parts of the trial, 26 subjects were treated with sunitinib 15 mg/m 2  and 9 patients were treated with 20 mg/m 2 . The median number of cycles started was 1 for all 3 parts of the study. Four patients overall had started ≥ 5 cycles.

All the 35 patients evaluated experienced at least one TEAEs and at least one treatment-related TEAEs. Approximately half of the patients experienced a SAE. Grade 5 AEs were reported in 6 patients: of them, only one Grade 5 AE, occurred in a 6-years old girl with diffuse-pontine glioma in Part B (20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/m 2 ), was reported to be treatment-related. The investigator assessed the causality of aspiration as possibly related to sunitinib, stating the AE played a minor contribution to death, and the causality of the death was reported as the disease under study. According to the National Cancer Institute CTEP (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) assessment, the grade 5 aspiration was considered unrelated to sunitinib  and  related to  the  glioma  and  to  disease  progression.  All the  other  deaths  occurred in  the study were not considered related to sunitinib.

Overall, in Part A of the study, the most frequent all causality TEAEs, mainly of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity  were  decreased  platelet  count  and  WBC,  decreased  neutrophil  count  and  increased  ALT (decreased neutrophil count mainly of severity Grade 3 or 4). In Part B of the study, the most frequent all causality TEAEs, mainly of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity were hypertension, hypophosphatemia, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased WBC count, decreased neutrophil, and increased AST. In Part C of the study, the most frequent all causality TEAEs, mainly of Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity were fatigue, anemia, hypermagnesemia, decreased lymphocyte, decreased neutrophil, decreased WBC count, and increased ALT.

Study A6181196: This is a phase I/II study of sunitinib in young patients with advanced GIST. Starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2  per day on schedule 4/2 for up to 18 cycles (24 months). A total of 6 patients received at least 3 cycles of the study treatment and 1 patient received all 18 of the planned cycles. Overall, the median duration of treatment was 219 days (i.e. 7.3 months) and the mean daily dose  (SD)  was  27.12  (7.192)  mg.  The  dose  was  increased  to  22.5  mg/m2  per  day  in  5  of  the  6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients. Dose reduction due to an AE is reported in one patient.

All  6 patients  in  the  safety  population  experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  and  at  least  one  treatmentrelated  TEAEs.  AEs  of  Grade  3  or  4  were  reported  in  5 patients,  of  them  4  patients  (66.7%)  had Grades 3 or 4 treatment -related TEAEs. No Grade 5 TEAEs were reported. In all 6 patients, at least 1 TEAE and treatment-related AE were reported in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs were diarrhea, Headache, Nausea, Neutropenia and WBC  count decreased in 3 (50.0%) patients each, the majority being Grade 1-2. Grade 3 Hypophosphatemia,  Neutropenia,  and  Thrombocytopenia  were  reported  in  1 (16.7%) patient  each. Grade 4 Neutropenia was reported in 1 patient. Not deaths or SAE were reported in this study. One patient permanently discontinued due to Grade 2 anemia.

Study  ACNS1021:  This  is  a  phase  II  study  of  sunitinib  in  recurrent,  refractory  or  progressive  High Grade Glioma and Ependymoma in paediatric and young adult patients. This study was prematurely closed  due  to  the  lack  of  disease  control.  The  safety  population  included  29  subjects:  of  them,  13 (44.8%)  had all-causality  SAEs,  the  most  common  ( ≥ 10%)  being  Haemorrhage  intracranial, Hydrocephalus,  Neoplasm  progression,  and  Seizure  (each  reported  for  3  [10.3%]  patients).  Most common treatment-related TEAEs were neutrophil count decrease (20.7%, 6 events all Grade 3-4), intracranial haemorrage (10.3%, 3 patients having one grade 1, one grade 3 and one grade 4 events), amylase increase and fatigue (both 6.9%). A total of 18 patients died during the study: for one of which  protocol  therapy  was  considered  to  have  had  a  'minor  contribution  to  death',  due  to  an intracranial haemorrage developed 13 days before death. Intracranial haemorrage was also the most common  SAE  (3  events,  all  considered  treatment  related).  Cerebral  haemorrage  (including  fatal events)  is  a  known  ADR  for  sutent,  but  with  frequency  'uncommon'.  The  relative  high  rate  of intracranial haemorrage in the pediatric CNS tumor setting has been highlighted in the SmPC.

Safety  data  from  the  retrospective  case  series  in  GIST:  In  Janeway  et  al  (7  patients),  the  more commonly reported AEs were fatigue, haematoological and GI events. In the 9 patients described by Rutkowski,  the  grade  3  events  reported  were  cholecystitis,  hypothyroidism  and  anaemia,  fatigue,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mucositis and diarrhoea in 3 patients overall. No grade 4 and 5 treatment related AEs were reported in both studies. No safety data have been collected in the Agaram manuscript (4 patients).

Post-marketing data: post-marketing data revealed that Sutent use has been reported in the paediatric population.  The  MAH  stated  that  no  new  safety  signals  with  regards  to  paediatric  use  have  been identified.

Although the MAH considered sunitinib to be well tolerated in the paediatric population, it should be noted the high rate of grade 3-4 treatment related events reported across the studies (e.g. 66.7% in study A6181196; 88.3%, 45.5% and 50% in Part A, B and C of Study ADVL0612 respectively, 34.5% in Study ACNS1021), indicating that the toxicity of the agent is not negligible. Information regarding ADR reported from the available paediatric studies has been included in the SmPC.

Based on the data provided, several TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances, also with high severity grade, have been reported across clinical trials with sunitinib in children reported also as related to sunitinib. The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  this  finding.  The  MAH  reviewed  the  TEAEs  of  electrolyte disturbances occurred in paediatric studies, reporting that 9/70 (13%) patients reported 11 Grade 3 TEAEs [hypophosphatemia (4), hyperkalaemia (3), hyponatraemia (2), hypokalaemia (2)]; 6/11 were considered probably or possibly related to sunitinib, and 3/6 of them were serious and resolved. The three  SAEs  (hypophosphatemia,  hypokalaemia,  hyponatraemia)  were  considered  confounded  by advanced primary tumor and paraneoplastic syndrome (SIADH). In study ACNS1021, the 3 episodes of electrolyte disturbances reported (G4 hypocalcemia (2 episodes) and G3 hypokaliemia (1 event)) were reported  on  laboratory  values  and  not  as  TEAE,  and  no  further  information  regarding  possible relationship with study drug as evaluated by investigator are available. Hypophosphatemia has been reported in 4.8 section as Grade 3 ADR recorded in A6181196 study. Based on the data provided, no further information is considered needed in the SmPC.

## 9. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 9.1. User consultation

The MAH was previously requested by the CHMP (procedure EMEA/H/C/000687/II/0065) to perform and to submit a new user testing in the next relevant variation. The MAH submitted the results of the readability testing.

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## PMAREQDD -A618w -Other-366

1. It  seems  that  paediatric  data  from  study  ADVL0612  have  not  been  included  in  the  PK-PD analysis, the MAH should clarify and provide the descriptive statistics for the subjects baseline characteristics and covariates considered in building the population PK-PD model, if different compared to the population PK model.

## PMAR -EQDD -A618b -DP4846

2. Considering the importance of the BSA values, the MAH is request to add a reference also to BSA values in the proposed text on SmPC.

## SimCYP Simulation

3. Possible consequences of modelling underestimation of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties exposures from a safety point of view should be discussed.
4. All the simulated exposure measures of sunitinib and SU012662 were done following 15mg/m2 daily oral administration of sunitinib, however the proposed dosage to be included in the SmPC is  20mg/m2 daily. Therefore the MAH is requested to perform the same simulation and the same comparison with the observed data also with 20mg/m2 daily dosage in order to directly compare the simulated exposure of the proposed dosage to be reported on the SmPC and the observed paediatric data.
5. An in depth discussion on the proposed dose reported in the SmPC is needed:
- a) Population  PK  and  PK-PD  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366, using  pooled  data  from paediatric  and  adult  patients )  conclusions:  Based  on  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  trial simulation results, a starting dose of ~15 mg/m2/day appears to be inadequate; however, a starting dose of ~25 mg/m2/day is predicted to be more appropriate in pediatric patients with  GIST  and  provides  comparable  plasma  drug  exposures,  and  subsequently  safety,  and efficacy to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg/day on Schedule 4/2. Although the starting dose of 15 mg/m2 was selected as the starting dose for the GIST pediatric study A6181196, based on the Phase 1 data from heavily pre-treated pediatric patients with CNS tumours  (solid  tumours),  the  option  for  intra-patient  dose  escalation  to  22.5  mg/m2  and subsequently to 30 mg/m2 was allowed to ensure maximum plasma drug exposure for each individual patient;
- b) Population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846, using  data  from  paediatric  patients ) conclusions: Based on the final PK model predictions, a sunitinib dose of approximately 20 mg/m2/day in paediatric patients with GIST aged 6-17 years would be expected to lead to similar total plasma exposures for sunitinib and SU012662 as compared to adult patients with GIST on 50 mg/day, on Schedule 4/2;
- c) PBPK  analysis  conclusions:  Based  on  the  simulated  exposures  in  different  ages  groups  of paediatrics  patients,  the  sunitinib  dose  that  will  lead  to  predicted  steady-state  total  plasma

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure over the dosing interval (i.e. steady-state AUC) similar to what has been observed in adults  with  GIST  (1233  ng·hr/mL  for  sunitinib,  551  ng·hr/mL  for  SU012662,  and  1822 ng·hr/mL for the total active moieties) at 50 mg once daily (QD) is 17 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, and 24 mg/m2 for sunitinib ;  28  mg/m2,  27  mg/m2,  and  26  mg/m2  for  SU012662;  20 mg/m2,  22  mg/m2,  and  25  mg/m2  for  the  total  active  moieties,  respectively,  for  the  age groups 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 years old .

- d) In the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies 25 mg/m2/day and 20 mg/m2/day are reported  into  two  different  sections  as  dose  predicted  to  provide  comparable  sunitinib exposure to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg QD on schedule 4/2.
- e) The  MTD calculated  in  study  ADVL0612  was  lower  compared  to  the  doses  reported  above: MDT for pediatric patients without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation was indeed established to be 15 mg/m2 schedule 4/2. Although the MAH noted that in some cases  patients  were  able  to  escalate  sunitinib  dose  (e.g.  in  study  A6181196),  there  is  a concern of safety with doses higher than the MTD. The MAH should take this data into account in its discussion.

Given  all  the  above  considerations,  the  indication  of  the  dose  appears  confounding,  therefore, further discussion and analyses are requested.

## Clinical safety

6. Based on the data provided, several TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances (i.e., hypo/hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypo/hyperkaliemia, hyponatriemia, hypermagnesemia), also with high severity grade, have been reported across clinical trials with sunitinib in children (e.g. in Study A6181196: hypophosphatemia G3; in Study ADVL0612, G3 hyponatriemia, G3 hypophosphatemia, G3 hyperkaliemia; in study ACNS1021 hypocalcemia G4 and hyponatriemia G3). In various cases they are reported as related to sunitinib. It is noted that no electrolyte imbalances are reported as ADR of sunitinib in the SmPC section 4.8. The MAH should discuss this finding, and evaluate how to eventually reflect relevant information for paediatric patients in the SmPC.

## User testing

7. The MAH has committed to provide the results of a new readability testing (requested by CHMP with EMA procedure EMEA/H/C/000687/II/0065) during the 1 st  RSI of this procedure.

It seems that paediatric data from study ADVL0612 have not been included in the PK-PD analysis, the MAH should clarify and provide the descriptive statistics for the subjects baseline characteristics and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

covariates considered in building the population PK-PD model, if different compared to the population PK model.

## Summary of the MAH's response

For the integrated population PK-PD analyses of safety endpoints in pediatric and adult patients with GIST and solid tumors, the data collected from Studies 248-ONC-0511-002, RTKC-0511-005, RTKC0511-016,  and  RTKC-0511-018  in  adult  patients  with  solid  tumors;  Study  ADVL0612  in  pediatric patients with solid tumors; and Studies A6181004, A6181045, A6181047, and RTKC-0511-013 in adult patients with GIST were pooled.  However, for the efficacy, only the studies in patients with GIST were included (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366 PKPD - Published Part A Section 3).

All  the  available  safety  data  from  Study  ADVL0612  were  included  in  the  PK-PD  analyses  for  safety endpoints. However, for efficacy, the PK-PD modeling for the Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) only included  adult  GIST  data.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  key  binding  elements  included  in Measure  #3  of  the  approved  Pediatric  Investigational  Plan  (PIP)  in  which  it  was  specified  to  only perform the PK-PD modeling using SLD data in adult patients with GIST. However, to further confirm the efficacy predictions in pediatric patients with GIST, the predictions were compared to the available literature efficacy data from Janeway et al and Agaram et al (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366 PKPD Published Part A Section 6.4).

The descriptive statistics for the subject baseline characteristics and covariates considered in building the final PK-PD models for each PK-PD endpoint are provided in Table 1. Therefore, with the exception of Tumor Type effect for the efficacy endpoint SLD, all the covariates listed in Table 1 were examined in building the PK-PD models for safety and efficacy endpoints.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has clarified the use of ADVL0612 study data for the PK/PD model: data from this study were included only for safety endpoints. The descriptive statistics for the subjects baseline characteristics from study ADVL0612 have not been provided, however it has been found in the study report body submitted for a previous variation application.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved

## Question 2

Considering  the  importance  of  the  BSA  values,  the  MAH  is  request  to  add  a  reference  also  to  BSA values in the proposed text on SmPC.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The reference to the BSA range of 1.1 to 1.87 m2 (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846 Figures 25 and 26) has been now added to the SmPC Section 5.2 under Pediatric Population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following is reported the relative part of the SmPC, section 5.2, proposed as to be added:

Furthermore,  based  on  an  integrated  population  PK analysis  of  pooled  data  from  the  3  paediatric studies ( 2 pediatric solid tumor studies and 1 pediatric GIST study; ages: 6 years to 11 years and 12 years to 17 years), baseline body surface area (BSA) was a significant covariate on apparent clearance of su nitinib and its active metabolite. Based on this analysis, a dose of approximately 20 mg/m2 daily (BSA  range:  1.101.87  m2) in  paediatric  patients ,  with  BSA  values  between  1.10  and  1.87  m 2 ,  is expected to provide plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite comparable (between 75 and 125% of the AUC) to those in adults with GIST administered sunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (AUC 1233 ng.hr/mL) .

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH agrees with EMA recommendation, and the BSA value has been added to Section 5.2 of the SmPC, subsection ' Paediatric population '.

## Conclusion

Issue solved, provided that the changes to the proposed text to be added in section 5.2 of the SmPC will be implemented.

## Question 3

## SimCYP Simulation

Possible consequences of modelling underestimation of sunitinib, SU012662, and total active moieties exposures from a safety point of view should be discussed.

## Summary of the MAH's response

It is important to note that the determined pediatric dose of 20 mg/m2 was based on the integrated population  PK  analysis.  This  is  a  well-established  methodology  based  on  non-linear  mixed-effects modeling  (NONMEM)  and  it  allowed  the  development  of  a  parsimonious  PK  model  that  best fit/described the pediatric data in both solid tumors and GIST in order to derive the pediatric dose that achieves  comparable  systemic  exposures  to  those  in  adults  with  GIST.  Therefore,  the  observed potential  underestimation of  predicted  concentrations  of  sunitinib,  SU012662,  and  total  drug  by  the SimCYP PBPK model would not be clinically relevant in relation to the determined dose of 20 mg/m2, which was based on the integrated population PK analysis.

Unlike  the  integrated  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  approach  which  fit  a  PK  model  to  the clinically  observed  data  in  pediatrics,  the  SimCYP  PBPK  model  development  strategy  used  a  hybrid approach, the bottom up approach (ie, in vitro measured values) coupled with the top down approach (observed pharmacokinetics in adults), to extrapolate and predict the plasma exposures in pediatrics (SimCYP Report Section 3.1). As a result, a slight difference between the predicted exposures and the observed exposures in pediatrics would not be unexpected. Nevertheless, as requested by the CHMP, the  MAH  assessed  whether  this  difference  (ie,  underestimation  in  this  case)  would  alter  the  dose recommendation in the pediatrics, based on the SimCYP PBPK model.

Assuming  an  approximate  15%  underestimation  of  SimCYP  exposures  (average  total  drug  AUC24 underestimation,  SimCYP  Report  Section  4),  the  revised  projected  doses  based  on  SimCYP  (ie,  19 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 21 mg/m2 for 12-17 years instead of 22 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 25 mg/m2 for 12-17 years) would be even closer to the dose of 20 mg/m2 (ie, within approximately 5% instead  of  25%)  and  remain  consistent  with  and  confirming  the  dose  determined  by  the  integrated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population  PK  analysis  (20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by  SimCYP approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

Based on SimCYP, the revised projected dose, assuming an approximate 15% of SimCYP exposure, remains consistent with dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis (20 mg/m2).

## Conclusion

## Issue resolved

## Question 4

## SimCYP Simulation

All the simulated exposure measures of sunitinib and SU012662 were done following 15mg/m2 daily oral administration of sunitinib, however the proposed dosage to be included in the SmPC is 20mg/m2 daily. Therefore the MAH is requested to perform the same simulation and the same comparison with the  observed  data  also  with  20mg/m2  daily  dosage  in  order  to  directly  compare  the  simulated exposure of the proposed dosage to be reported on the SmPC and the observed paediatric data.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Upon the request by the CHMP, the MAH conducted additional simulations with 20 mg/m2 daily dosage and compared to the observed pediatric data.  As the observed pediatric data were at 15 mg/m2 daily dosage, the observed exposure parameters were dose corrected to 20 mg/m2 for comparison purpose. Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 show clinically observed dose-corrected and SimCYP-predicted sunitinib and  SU012662  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  in  pediatrics  in  Study  ADVL0612  (3-21  years old), Study ACNS1021 (3-19 years old), and Study A6181196 (13-16 years old) after a multiple 20mg/m2 daily oral dose of sunitinib, respectively.  Overall, the ratios of the predicted versus observed dose-corrected exposure values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were essentially the same as the ones obtained with the dose of 15 mg/m2 (SimCYP Report Section 4), which is not unexpected considering the dose-linearity in the PK model.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH performed the requested analysis. The ratios of the predicted versus observed dose-corrected exposure values following trial simulations with the dose of 20 mg/m2 were very closed to the ones obtained with the dose of 15 mg/m 2 .

## Conclusion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 5

## SimCYP Simulation

An in depth discussion on the proposed dose reported in the SmPC is needed:

- a) Population  PK  and  PKPD  analysis  (PMAR -EQDD -A618w -Other-366,  using  pooled  data  from paediatric  and  adult  patients)  conclusions:  Based  on  the  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  trial simulation results, a starting dose of ~15 mg/m2/day appears to be inadequate; however, a starting dose of ~25 mg/m2/day is predicted to be more approp riate in pediatric patients with GIST and provides comparable plasma drug exposures, and subsequently safety, and efficacy to  those  in  adult  patients  with  GIST  treated  at  50  mg/day  on  Schedule  4/2.  Although  the starting  dose  of  15  mg/m2  was  selected  as  the starting  dose  for  the  GIST  pediatric  study A6181196, based on the Phase 1 data from heavily pre -treated  pediatric  patients  with  CNS tumours  (solid  tumours),  the  option  for  intra -patient  dose  escalation  to  22.5  mg/m2  and subsequently to 30 mg/m2 was allowed to ensure maximum plasma drug exposure for each individual patient;
- b) Population  PK  analysis  (PMAR -EQDD -A618b -DP4846,  using  data  from  paediatric  patients) conclusions:  Based  on  the  final  PK  model  predictions,  a  sunitinib  dose  of  approximately  20 mg/m2/day in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST  aged  6 -17 years would be expected to lead to similar total plasma exposures for sunitinib and SU012662 as compared to adult patients with GIST on 50 mg/day, on Schedule 4/2;
- c) PBPK  analysis  conclusions:  Based  on  the  simulate d  exposures  in  different  ages  groups  of paediatrics  patients,  the  sunitinib  dose  that  will  lead  to  predicted  steady -state  total  plasma exposure over the dosing interval (i.e. steady -state AUC) similar to what has been observed in adults  with  GIST  (1233  ng·hr/mL  for  sunitinib,  551  ng·hr/mL  for  SU012662,  and  1822 ng·hr/mL for the total active moieties) at 50 mg once daily (QD) is 17 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, and 24 mg/m2 for sunitinib; 28 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 26 mg/m2 for SU012662; 20 mg/m2, 22 mg/m2, and 25 mg/m2 for the total active moieties, respectively, for the age groups 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 17 years old.
- d) In  the  Summary  of  Clinical  Pharmacology  Studies  25  mg/m2/day  and  20  mg/m2/day  are reported into two different sections as dose predicted to provide compar able sunitinib exposure to those in adult patients with GIST treated at 50 mg QD on schedule 4/2.
- e) The MTD calculated in study ADVL0612 was lower compared to the doses reported above: MDT for  pediatric  patients  without  previous  exposure  to  anthracyclines  or cardiac  irradiation  was indeed established to be 15 mg/m2 schedule 4/2. Although the MAH noted that in some cases patients were able to escalate sunitinib dose (e.g. in study A6181196), there is a concern of safety  with  doses  higher  than  the  MTD.  The  MAH  should  take  this  data  into  account  in  its discussion.

Given all the above considerations, the indication of the dose appears confounding, therefore, further discussion and analyses are requested .

## Summary of the MAH's response

The  determination  of  the  dose  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST,  providing  comparable  exposures  to those in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2, were made using 3 different analyses and approaches.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a. As part of the population PK and PK-PD analysis (PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366, using pooled data from paediatric and adult patients), only data from one pediatric study in patients with solid tumors were available to be included in the pooled dataset. The remaining data included adult data in patients with  GIST  and  solid  tumors.  As  part  of  the  final  population  PK  model  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662, Tumor Type (Solid Tumor vs GIST) was one of the variables identified as significant covariates on CL/F and subsequently was used in extrapolation of PK parameters in pediatric patients with GIST (PMAREQDD-A618w-Other-366 PKPD - Published Part A Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2). Based on the final PK model, sunitinib (and SU012662) extrapolated CL/F in pediatric patients with GIST was predicted to be higher  than  that  in  pediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors.  Therefore,  in  the  absence  of  PK  data  in pediatric patients with GIST at the time of the analysis, it was assumed that the higher CL/F observed in  GIST  vs  Solid  Tumors  in  adults  was  also  applicable  to  that  in  pediatric  patients  [Note:  this assumption was not later  confirmed  as  part  of  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDDA618b-DP4-846)].

b. In contrast to the initial population PK analysis (ie, PMAR-EQDD-A618w-Other-366), the integrated population  PK  analysis  (PMAR-EQDD-A618b-DP4-846,  using  data  from  only  pediatric  patients)  was based  on  only  pediatric  PK  data  and  included  PK  data  in  both  GIST  and  solid  tumor  patients  (2 pediatric solid tumor studies and 1 pediatric GIST study). Contrary to the initial analysis, which was mainly based on adult data, this analysis did not identify Tumor Type (GIST vs. Solid Tumor) as a significant covariate on CL/F. Based on this analysis, due to the lack of Tumor Type effect on CL/F in pediatric patients, the CL/F values estimated for pediatric GIST patients were comparable to that in Solid Tumor patients and mainly driven by differences in body surface area (PMAR EQDD-A618b-DP4846 Section 6.2 and 6.3). Therefore, the difference in the dose projections based on the initial analysis and the integrated analysis (ie, 25 mg/m2 vs 20 mg/m2) could be in part due to the absence of Tumor Type effect (GIST vs Solid Tumor) on CL/F in pediatric patients.

c. In the PBPK analysis (SimCYP Report, using physiochemical properties, preclinical, and clinical adult data),  the  PK  of  sunitinib  and  its  active  metabolite  was  predicted/simulated  based  on  a  hybrid approach (bottom up and top down approaches) using both physiochemical properties and pre-clinical data  (ie, bottom up) as well as adult clinical PK data (top down). Based on the SimCYP PBPK model, the PK predictions/simulations for pediatric patients appeared to be consistent with the observed data in both solid tumors and GIST patients with the geometric mean ratios of observed vs predicted for the majority of the PK parameters Cmax, AUC, and Ctrough falling within the 0.8 to 1.25 range. Similarly, the dose projections appeared to be within approximately 25% of the dose estimated by the integrated population  PK  analysis  (ie,  20  mg/m2).  Assuming  an  under-prediction  of  approximately  15% (Response to Question 3), the revised projected doses (ie, 19 mg/m2 for 6-11 years and 21 mg/m2 for 12-17  years)  would  be  even  closer  (ie,  within  approximately  5%)  to  the  dose  estimated  by  the integrated  pop  PK  analysis  (ie,  20  mg/m2).  Therefore,  in  both  scenarios,  the  dose  projections  by SimCYP approach support the 20 mg/m2 dose determined by the integrated population PK analysis.

d.  Considering  that  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  included  data  from  3  pediatric  studies (instead of  only  1)  in  both  GIST  and  solid  tumors  patients  (instead  of  only  solid  tumors),  the  dose projection in pediatric patients with GIST based on the integrated population PK analysis, instead of the initial analysis, was selected as the proposed dose in pediatric patients with GIST (please also refer to  Responses  to  Questions  5a  and  5b  for  further  details).  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  in  the absence of a Tumor Type effect on CL/F in pediatric patients (ie, CL/F in GIST being similar to CL/F in solid tumors), the approximated population CL/F value based on the initial analysis, for the integrated population  PK  analysis  Solid  Tumor/GIST  patient  population,  appears  to  be  comparable  to  the population CL/F value from the integrated population PK analysis (ie, 24.2 L/h vs 24.0 L/h for sunitinib and  10.9  L/h  vs  11.1  L/h  for  SU012662),  further  confirming  the  inherent  consistency  in  CL/F projections  and  consequently  dose  projections  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST/solid  tumors  between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both analyses.

e. Based on the dose escalation study in pediatric patients with solid tumors, the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 15 mg/m2. The MTD projection was done in heavily pretreated pediatric patients with solid tumors and the majority of them with CNS tumors. In Study A6181196, although the starting dose was 15 mg/m2, it was escalated in 5/6 patients to 22.5 mg/m2 and in 2 out of 5 escalated further to 30 mg/m2. The average dose across the study was close to 20 mg/m2 (ie, 19.07 mg/m2; Study A6181196 CSR Section 12.1.1). In addition, based on the published case studies from Janeway et al and Rutkowski et al (Retrospective Analysis of Medical Records) in patients where the dose  per  body  surface  data  were  available,  the  median  (minimum-maximum)  dose  (ie,  starting  or average daily dose) per body surface area was 28 (17-36) mg/m2. In the majority of the patients (ie, 12 out of 15 patients), the dose was higher than 20 mg/m2 and was tolerated well. Therefore, based on  available  safety  data  from  Study  A6181196  and  published  case  reports,  the  starting  or  average daily doses of 20 mg/m2 should be well tolerated in pediatric patients with GIST.

Based  on  the  above,  the  MAH  would  like  to  confirm  that  there  are  no  confounding  factors  in determination of the projected dose in pediatric patients with GIST. The SmPC statement in regards to the  dose  of  approximately  20  mg/m2  is  in  reference  to  the  dose  in  pediatric  patients  expected  to provide  exposures  similar  to  that  obtained  in  adult  patients  with  GIST,  based  on  the  integrated population  PK  analysis.  In  addition,  based  on  available  safety  data  from  Study  A6181196  and published  case  reports,  the  safety  profile  of  the  starting  or  average  daily  doses  of  20  mg/m2  was manageable  in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST.  In  conclusion,  supportive  evidence  from  3  different analyses  and  from  the  available  pediatric  safety  data  in  patients  with  GIST  indicates  that  the  20 mg/m2  dose  is  a  tolerable  dose  in  children  aging  6-17  years  and  provides  similar  drug  plasma exposures compared to those in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The  difference  between  the  initial  population  PK  analysis  (pooled  data  from  adult  and  paediatric patients)  and  the  integrated  population  PK  analysis  (only  paediatric  data)  is  the  inclusion  of  Tumor type as covariate on CL/F. In the first analysis it resulted to be significant, in the second one not.  The integrated  population  PK analysis  was  selected  as  final  analysis  to  be  used  to  calculate  the  dose  in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST at 50 mg on Schedule 4/2.

Regarding the MTD, which is reported in SmPC, this was defined to be 15 mg/m 2  on schedule 4/2 for the  paediatric  population  (without  risk  factors  for  cardiac  toxicity)  based  on  the  phase  I  doseescalation study ADVL0612. As stated by the MAH in its response, the MTD projection in ADVL0612 study  was  done  in  heavily  pretreated  pediatric  patients  mainly  with  CNS  tumors.  In  addition,  the starting dose in both clinical trial A6181196 and ACNS1021 was 15 mg/m 2  (based on the MTD) with the option to escalate the dose based on toxicity: in A6181196 some patients were able to receive up to 30 mg/m 2  (data on how many patients escalated has not been found for ACNS1021 study). Further, the MAH noted that in the majority of the patients on the published case studies, the dose was higher than 20 mg/m 2 . The information that children received starting or average daily doses of 20 mg/m 2  is not emerging from the SmPC, therefore it appears somewhat misleading to report that the MTD is 15 mg/m 2 , and that 20 mg/m 2  is the dose in pediatric patients expected to provide exposures similar to that obtained in adult patients with GIST.

The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sutent received by paediatric patients in the clinical setting (e.g. 15 mg/m2 as starting dose, use of increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between MTD and wording on 20 mg/m 2  . (OC)

## Conclusion

## Issue partially solved

## Question 6

Based  on  the  data  provided,  several  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  (i.e.,  hypo/hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia,  hypo/hyperkaliemia,  hyponatriemia,  hypermagnesemia),  also  with  high  severity grade,  have  been  reported  across  clinical  trials  with  sunitinib  in  children  (e.g.  in  Study  A6181196: hypophosphatemia G3; in Study ADVL0612, G3 hyponatriemia, G3 hypophosphatemia, G3 hyperkaliemia; in study ACNS1021 hypocalcemia G4 and hyponatriemia G3). In various cases they are reported  as  related  to  sunitinib.  It  is  noted  that  no  electrolyte  imbalances  are  reported  as  ADR  of sunitinib in the SmPC section 4.8. The MAH should discuss this finding, and evaluate how to eventually reflect relevant information for paediatric patients in the SmPC.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Upon review of the TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances in paediatric studies, 9 out of the 70 patients reported 11 Grade 3 TEAEs [hypophosphatemia (4), hyperkalaemia (3), hyponatraemia (2), hypokalaemia (2)] with sunitinib in A6181196 and ADVL0612 studies. Most of these TEAEs were nonserious and resolved at the time of latest reported outcome. Of these 11 TEAEs, 6 TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances [G3 hypophosphatemia (4), G3 hyponatraemia (1), G3 hypokalemia (1)] were considered either possibly or probably related to sunitinib by the investigator. In 3/6, the TEAEs were serious and reported  as  resolved.  On  review  of  the  case  of  serious  G3  hyponatraemia  (2007092810),  the  MAH considers hyponatraemia was  confounded by the presence of a paraneoplastic syndrome  of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) secondary to progressive lung disease and was likely related to metastatic disease under study. Of note, this patient developed G3 hyponatraemia 10 days post sunitinib  discontinuation.  Upon  review  of  serious  TEAEs  of  G3  hypophosphatemia  and  G3 hypokalemia  that  were  reported  in  a  patient  with  refractory/recurrent  neuroblastoma  in  the  case 2007039720,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  patient's  progressive  underlying  disease  Central  Nervous System (CNS) pathology may have contributed to the occurrence of these events.

In  study  ACNS1021,  no  TEAEs  of  electrolyte  disturbances  were  reported.  Three  patients  reported laboratory abnormalities of G4 hypocalcaemia (2) based on total calcium levels. Ionized calcium was not reported and these were not reported as TEAEs. One patient had a laboratory abnormality of G3 hypokalemia which was not reported as TEAE. Please note, there was no laboratory abnormality of G3 hyponatraemia. Overall, since most of the patients with TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances had highly progressive  CNS  tumors,  it  is  suggested  that  the  underlying  disease  may  have  contributed  to  the development of these laboratory abnormalities. The TEAEs of electrolyte disturbance reported in these studies were manageable and well-tolerated in this patient population. Thus, the MAH proposes that the  currently  proposed  text  in  the  updated  SmPC  appropriately  represents  the  safety  information regarding TEAEs of electrolyte disturbances from these studies.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

9/70  (13%)  patients  reported  11  Grade  3  TEAEs  [hypophosphatemia  (4),  hyperkalaemia  (3), hyponatraemia (2), hypokalaemia (2)]; 6/11 were considered probably or possibly related to sunitinib, and  3/6  of  them  were  serious  and  resolved.  The  three  SAEs  (hypophosphatemia,  hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia) were considered confounded by advanced primary tumor and paraneoplastic syndrome  (SIADH).  In  study  ACNS1021,  the  3  episodes  of  electrolyte  disturbances  reported  (G4 hypocalcemia (2 episodes) and G3 hypokaliemia (1 event)) were reported on laboratory values and not as TEAE, and no further information regarding possible relationship with study drug as evaluated by investigator are available.

It is noted that SmPC 4.8 section includes the information that, for A6181196, Grade 3 adverse drug reactions  reported  were  hypophosphatemia,  (neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia)  in  1  patient  each (16.7%) .  Based on the MAH's review of the grade ≥3 electrolyte disturbances described, no further information is considered needed in the SmPC.

## 12. 2 nd  Request for supplementary information

## 12.1. Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

1. The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages of  Sutent  received  by  paediatric  patients  in  the  clinical  trials/case  series  (e.g.  15  mg/m2  as starting dose, use of increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between MTD (15 mg/m2) and wording on 20 mg/m2.

## User testing

2. Q6 (Please name three very common side effects that may occur with Sutent) has a long list of answers that could increase the possibility of a positive results. Moreover, it is not clear how the answer is scored in case the participant listed only one or two side effects. This aspect should be clarified.
3. Q9  (What  should  a  breast-feeding  woman  consider  before  she  starts  taking  Sutent?)  has  two possible  answers  (She  should  tell  her  doctor.  She  should  not  breast-feed  during  treatment  with Sutent.  Optional:  If  she  is  breast-feeding,  she  should  ask  her  doctor  or  pharmacist  for  advice before taking this  medicine).  The  first  answer  represents  the  focus  since  breast-feeding  woman should clearly understand that breast-feeding must be stopped before she starts treatment with Sutent.  Since  it  is  not  possible  to  check  the  answers  due  to  the  lack  of  a  detailed  summary  of individual  responses, it should be clarified if a positive outcome was registered in case only the optional answer was given.
4. Regarding questions for which a 'difficulty' or 'very difficulty' score in finding the information was reported, a clarification is needed, since there is a discrepancy between data reported in table 14 and those reported in tables 8 and 9.
5. Q4 (Suppose you are treated for GIST (Gastrointestinal stromal tumour). What is the usual dose?) registered the 'very difficult finding' score. The wording used in the PL section 3 is: 'Your doctor will prescribe a dose that is right for you, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. If you are being treated for GIST or MRCC, the usual dose is 50 mg once daily taken for 28 days (4 weeks), followed by 14 days (2 weeks) of rest (no medicine), in 6-week cycles. If you are being treated for pNET, the usual dose is 37.5 mg once daily without a rest period'.
6. In order to better identify the information regarding the dose indicated for each tumor type in the PL, a bulleted list could be used to distinguish the two possible dose regimens.

## 13.  Assessment  of  the  responses  to  the  2 nd   Request  for Supplementary Information

## 13.1 Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

## Question 1

The MAH should propose wording in the appropriate sections of the SmPC to describe the dosages of Sutent received by paediatric patients in the clinical trials/case series (e.g. 15 mg/m2 as starting dose, use of increased doses etc.) in order to explain the apparent contradiction between MTD (15 mg/m2) and wording on 20 mg/m2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the MAH's response

The  MAH  agrees  with  the  Rapporteur's  recommendation  and  Section  5.2  of  the  SmPC  has  been updated to read as follows (text in 'tracked changes' mode):

## Pharmacokinetic properties:

Furthermore,  based  on  an  integrated  population  PK  analysis  of pooled  data  from  the  3  paediatric studies (2 paediatric solid tumor studies and 1 paediatric GIST study; ages: 6 years to 11 years and 12 years to 17 years), baseline body surface area (BSA) was a significant covariate on apparent clearance of sunitinib and its active metabolite. Based on this analysis, a dose of approximately 20 mg/m 2 daily (BSA  range:  1.101.87  m2) in  paediatric  patients ,  with  BSA  values  between  1.10  and  1.87  m 2 ,  is expected to provide plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite comparable (between 75 and 125% of the AUC) to those in adults with GIST administered sunitinib 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (AUC 1233 ng.hr/mL) .

In paediatric studies, the starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2 ,  which in paediatric patients with GIST increased to 22.5 mg/m 2 and subsequently to 30 mg/m 2 (not  to  exceed  the  total  dose  of  50 mg/day)  based  on  individual  patient  safety/tolerability.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  publi shed literatures in paediatric patients with GIST, the calculated starting dose ranged from 16.6 mg/m 2 to 36 mg/m 2 , increased to doses as high as 40.4 mg/m 2 (not exceeding the total dose of 50 mg/day).

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH modified the SmPC as per CHMP request. The wording is considered overall acceptable for this section, although a minor rewording to specify that the starting dose of 15 mg/m2 was based on the identified MDT is suggested, as follow (additional words highlighted in yellow):

## Section 4.8

In these paediatric patients without previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac irradiation, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified (see section 5.1).

## Section 5.2

In paediatric studies, the starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m 2 (based on the MTD identified in the  Phase  1  dose-escalation  study,  see  section  5.1), which  in  paediatric  patients  with  GIST increased to 22.5 mg/m 2 and subsequently to 30 mg/m 2 (not to exceed the total dose of 50 mg/day) based on individual patient safety/tolerability. Furthermore, according to the published literatures in paediatric  patients  with  GIST,  the  calculated  starting  dose  ranged  from  16.6  mg/m 2 to  36  mg/m 2 , increased to doses as high as 40.4 mg/m 2 (not exceeding the total dose of 50 mg/day).

## Conclusion

Issue solved, provided the rewording of sections 4.8 and 5.2 as suggested.

## User Testing

## Question 2

User testing Q6 (Please name three very common side effects that may occur with Sutent) has a long list of answers that could increase the possibility of a positive results. Moreover, it is not clear how the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

answer  is  scored  in  case  the  participant  listed  only  one  or  two  side  effects.  This  aspect  should  be clarified.

## Summary of the MAH's response

In  the  case  only  1  or  2  side  effects  are  listed,  the  question  is  repeated  and  rated  ' sufficiently understood ' or ' not understood ' depending on the answer.

Finding scores are not affected as the participant found the sought paragraph. Usually, if a participant found the information but gives an incomplete answer, he/she misunderstood the question.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The  MAH's  response  can  be  considered  acceptable,  however,  as  a  general  rule,  in  order  to  better assess the results of UT, it is preferable that a detailed summary of individual responses is submitted.

## Conclusion

## Issue solved

## Question 3

User testing Q9 (What should a breast-feeding woman consider before she starts taking Sutent?) has two possible answers (She should tell her doctor. She should not breast-feed during treatment with Sutent. Optional: If she is breast-feeding, she should ask her doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine). The first answer represents the focus since breast feeding woman should clearly understand that breast feeding must be stopped before she starts treatment with Sutent.

Since  it  is  not  possible  to  check  the  answers  due  to  the  lack  of  a  detailed  summary  of  individual responses, it should be clarified if a positive outcome was registered in case only the optional answer was given.

## Summary of the MAH's response

If,  after  repetition  of  the  question,  only  the  optional  answer  is  given,  the  question  is  rated  ' not found/not understood'.

Optional  answer  is  an  information  for  the  interviewer,  so  that  the  interviewer  knows  that  if  a participant additionally gives the optional answer, the answer must not be rated as incorrect.

## Question 4

Regarding  questions  for  which  a  'difficulty'  or  'very  difficulty'  score  in  finding  the  information  was reported, a clarification is needed, since there is a discrepancy between data reported in table 14 and those reported in tables 8 and 9.

## Summary of the MAH's response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table  14  of  the  user  testing  report  shows  the  detailed  ease  of  finding  results,  independent  of participants comments. In tables 8 and 9 individual questions are only listed if the participants provide a comment, independently of the finding or comprehension score.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

## Issue solved

## Question 5

Q4 (Suppose you are treated for GIST (Gastrointestinal  stromal tumour).  What  is  the  usual  dose?) registered the 'very difficult finding' score. The wording used in the PL section 3 is: 'Your doctor will prescribe a dose that is right for you, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. If you are being treated for GIST or MRCC, the usual dose is 50 mg once daily taken for 28 days (4 weeks), followed by 14 days (2 weeks) of rest (no medicine), in 6-week cycles. If you are being treated for pNET, the usual dose is 37.5 mg once daily without a rest period'.

In order to better identify the information regarding the dose indicated for each tumor type in the PL, a bulleted list could be used to distinguish the two possible dose regimens.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The MAH has updated the Package Leaflet accordingly.

## Additional changes to the SmPC made by the MAH

As per Rapporteur's comment, Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to include the efficacy data related to Study A6181196. In addition, the sentence related to the publications has been rephrased to avoid duplication of the text (changes highlighted in 'track changes mode'):

'Evidence from a Phase 1/2 study of oral sunitinib conducted in 6 paediatric patients with GIST aged 13 years to 16 year s  who received sunitinib on Schedule 4/2, at doses ranging between 15 mg/m 2 daily  and  30  mg/m 2 daily,  and  available  published  data  (20  paediatric  or  young  adult  patients  with GIST) indicated that sunitinib treatment resulted in disease stabilization in 18 of 26 (69.2%) patients, either after imatinib failure or intolerance (16 patients with stable disease out of 21), or de novo/after surgery (2 patients with stable disease out of 5). In this the Phase 1/2 study, stable disease and disease  progression  was  observed  in  3  out  of  6  patients  each  (1  patient  received  new adjuvant and 1 patient received adjuvant imatinib, respectively).  In the same study, 4 out of 6 patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3 -4 treatment-related adverse events ( Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, and thro mbocytopenia in 1 patient each and a Grade 4 neutropeni a was reported in 1 patient ) .

In  addition,  the  publications  reported  the  following  Grade  3  adverse  drug  reactions experienced  by  5  patients:  fatigue  (2),  gastrointestinal  adverse  drug  reactions  (including diarrhoea) (2), haematologic adverse drug reactions (including anaemia) (2), cholecystitis (1), hyperthyroidism (1), and mucositis (1).'

The MAH would like also to inform that in Section 4.8 and Section 5.1 the text was corrected as some events are not adverse drug reactions but treatment related treatment emergent adverse events.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH's proposal is accepted.
