## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

Imatinib medac, 100 mg and 400 mg hard capsules is a generic medicinal product of Glivec which has been authorised in the EU since 07/11/2001.

The active substance of Imatinib medac is imatinib (as mesilate), it is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ATC code: L01XE01) that potently inhibits the activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases. The safety and efficacy profile of imatinib has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of which can be found in the EPAR for Glivec. In addition, there is extensive post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Glivec, summary of the clinical data of imatinib is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted. The Applicant has demonstrated bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product Glivec. To support the marketing authorisation application, the Applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. The Applicant applied for the following indications: · Paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of treatment. · Paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in accelerated phase. · Adult and paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. · Adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. · Adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. · Adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD)  associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. · Adult  patients  with  advanced  hypereosinophilic  syndrome  (HES)  and/or  chronic  eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients
- with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery.

The effect of Imatinib medac on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined.

In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of Imatinib medac is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on objective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experience with Imatinib medac in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene rearrangements is very limited. Except in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, there are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases.

Imatinib medac is presented as hard gelatine capsules in two strengths; 100 and 400 mg, whereas the reference medicinal product Glivec is available in three strengths; 50mg, 100 mg and 400 mg and the two highest strengths are not only available as capsules but also as film-coated tablets.

The Imatinib medac pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

2.2 Quality aspects 2.2.1 Introduction The  finished  product  is  presented  as  hard  capsules  containing  100  mg  or  400  mg  of  imatinib  (as mesilate) as the active substance. Other ingredients are: Capsule filling Crospovidone (type A) Lactose monohydrate Magnesium stearate Capsule shell Gelatin Yellow iron oxide(E172) Titanium dioxide(E171) Red iron oxide  (E172) Black iron oxide(E172) The product is available in blisters made of PA-aluminium-PVC laminate and an aluminium foil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 2.2.2 Active substance The chemical name of imatinib (INN) as the mesilate salt is 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) methyl]-N-[4methyl-3-[[4-(3- pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-phenyl]-benzamide methane sulfonate salt . Medicinal product no longer authorised

Imatinib mesilate is a white to off-white crystalline powder, slightly hygroscopic, freely soluble in water, 0.1 M HCl, acetate buffer (pH=4.5), soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and very slightly soluble in dichloromethane and phosphate buffer (pH=6.8). It has a non-chiral molecular structure. Exhibits polymorphism and its most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form has been determined and the crystallisation process is designed to consistently deliver this form

The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture

Imatinib mesilate is synthesized in 5 main steps where imatinib is first produced followed by its transformation into the mesilate salt. The starting materials are well defined and commercially available. It is supplied by one active substance manufacturer.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and found acceptable.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

A photostability test following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one single batch and results under stress conditions (acidic and alkaline environment, impact of H2O2, impact of high temperature) were also provided for one batch.

Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. The potential formation of genotoxic impurities is addressed in the active substance specification. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC) related substances (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (LC-MS/MS, HPLC), polymorphism (XRPD), melting point (DSC), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), residuals solvents (GC) and microbiological purity (Ph.Eur.). The presence of genotoxic impurities in the specification raises no concerns as its potential formation has been addressed by the Applicant and batch analysis data for the drug substance comply with specification. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Batch analysis data are provided on three pilot scale batches produced with the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. Stability Three production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up to 18 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification (IR and HPLC), related substance (HPLC, XRPD), water content (KF), melting point (DSC) and assay (HPLC). The HPLC method demonstrated to be stability indicating.

## Pharmaceutical development

Imatinib medac hard gelatin capsules contain 100 or 400 mg of imatinib mesilate.

The intention during the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable formulation essentially equivalent to the reference medicinal product Glivec 100 mg, 400 mg film-coated tablets. The development studies were mainly performed in imatinib 400 mg hard capsules; the 100 mg hard capsules were developed to be dose proportional to the 400 mg capsules.

All the characteristics of the reference formulation and active substance were taken into consideration. The composition of the initial blend was similar to that of the reference tablet formulation. The formulation proposed for marketing contains the following excipients: crospovidone, lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. The capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium oxide, yellow iron oxide, red iron oxide and black iron oxide (colorants). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The compatibility of the active substance with these excipients was demonstrated during stability studies program. The difference in excipients between Imatinib medac hard capsules and the reference medicinal product Glivec (hard capsules or film-coated tablets) is not considered significant for the safety, efficacy and performance of the medicinal product. The Imatinib medac product information contains an appropriate warning about the presence of lactose. The Applicant performed a bioequivalence study on the 400 mg hard capsule and requested a biowaiver for the 100 mg strength.  Exemption of a bioavailability study for the 100 mg strength was acceptable since all requirements of a biowaiver for this strength have been fulfilled. A comparative dissolution study has been performed to support the biowaiver. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. The impurity profile of Imatinib medac has been compared with that of Glivec. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between impurities profiles of Imatinib medac 100 mg, 400 mg hard capsules and Glivec 100 mg, 400 mg film-coated tablets The primary packaging proposed is PA-aluminium-PVC laminate blisters with an aluminium foil. The material complies with the European requirements and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the product. Adventitious agents Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.

Gelatin is obtained from bovine/limed bone is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the gelatin used in the manufacture is provided.

## 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

The presence of genotoxic impurities in the active substance specification raises no concerns as its potential formation has been addressed by the Applicant and batch analysis data for the drug substance and the finished product comply with specification.

Although Imatinib medac contains different excipients compared to the reference medicinal product, it is considered not to affect its performance in the clinic. An adequate warning for lactose has been included in the product information.

2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 2.2.6 Recommendation(s) for future quality development Not applicable 2.3 Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1 Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as the introduction of Imatinib medac manufactured by medac is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all imatinib containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.3 Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of imatinib are well known. No nonclinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is considered of suitable quality.

In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), justification for not providing ERA is acceptable.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1 Introduction

This is an application for hard capsules containing imatinib (as mesilate) in two different strengths 100 and 400 mg. To support the marketing authorisation application, the Applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

The Applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of imatinib based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product for the indications applied for by the Applicant. No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**) is of particular relevance. GCP The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. Exemption A biowaiver for the formulation of the lower strength (100 mg) has been applied for based on dissolution profiles. The different hard capsules strengths are manufactured with the same process and by the same manufacturer. They have the same qualitative composition and a proportional quantitative composition. Dissolution profiles were performed in 0.1 M HCl, Buffer pH 4.5 and in buffer pH 6.8. Dissolution profiles for Glivec film-coated tablets and for imatinib hard capsules were performed in Ph Eur. apparatus 2 with sinkers in 900 ml of dissolution medium with rotation speed of 50 rpm. The dissolved amount of imatinib hard capsules 100 and 400 mg and from Glivec film-coated capsules 100 and 400 mg is above 85% in 0.1M HCl, as well as in buffer pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 with the exception of Glivec 100mg (batch: S0100) at pH 6.8 (about 77%) This evidence is sufficient to grant a biowaiver for the proportional formulations of lower strengths, also considering the linear PK of imatinib in the dose range of 25 to 1000 mg. Clinical studies To support the application, the Applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Population(s) studied

Forty-one (41) healthy human male and post-menopausal female subjects, who met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, were randomized but forty (40) subjects were dosed. Subjects were healthy, adult, males between 21 and 58 years of age (both inclusive) and females between 42 and 58 years of age (both inclusive), having a BMI between 18.5 to 27.99 kg/m 2 (both inclusive).

## Analytical methods

The analytical method chosen in this study is LC-MS/MS as this was a suitable technique to achieve the proposed lower level of quantification (LLOQ) which was 20 ng/mL. Also noted that the assay was selective using LC-MS/MS and the quantification would be done based on the mass to charge ratio of molecule. The method validation report was provided by the Applicant. Pharmacokinetic variables The primary pharmacokinetics parameters considered for the assessment of BE were Cmax and AUC0-t. The secondary pharmacokinetics parameters that were assessed were: AUC0-∞ Tmax, residual area, λz and t½. Statistical methods Statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained from subjects who completed both treatment periods of the study with no significant protocol deviations, using SAS Software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc. USA). Therefore results for thirty-six (36) subjects were statistically evaluated. The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for imatinib. An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at a significance level of 5 % ( α = 0.05). 90% confidence intervals of two one-sided t-tests for the ratio of geometric means between the formulations were calculated for ln-transformed data of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for imatinib. According to guideline and Study Protocol assumptions, if the 90% confidence interval of two onesided t-tests for ratio of geometric means (test formulation over reference formulation) for both Cmax and AUC0-t of imatinib are included entirely in the acceptance range of 80.00- 125.00%, the test formulation (Imatinib) will be concluded as bioequivalent to the reference formulation (Glivec).

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. PSUR submission At the time of granting the marketing authorisation, the submission of periodic safety update reports is not required for this medicinal product. However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product if the product is included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83 and published on the European medicines web-portal. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the Applicant and has been found acceptable as the Applicant declared that the content of package leaflet is the same as that of the reference product. 3. Benefit-risk balance This application concerns a generic version of Imatinib hard capsules. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The reference product Glivec is indicated for leukaemia.

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the Applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single centre, single dose, randomised, openlabel, two-period, 2-way cross-over study under fed conditions with a wash-out period of 14 days between each drug administration in each treatment period. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The test formulation of Imatinib medac met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Glivec .The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 4. Recommendation The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Imatinib medac is not similar to Tasigna (nilotinib), Sprycel (dasatinib), Vidaza (azacitidine), Evoltra(clorafabine), Atriance(nelarabine), Xaluprine (mercaptopurine), Bosulif(bosutinib), Iclusig(ponatinib) and Revlimid(lenalidomide) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Imatinib medac in the treatment of leukaemia is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal products subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2). Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation · Periodic Safety Update Reports At the time of granting the marketing authorisation, the submission of periodic safety update reports is not required for this medicinal product. However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product if the product is included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83 and published on the European medicines web-portal. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Conditions  or  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product

## · Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.
