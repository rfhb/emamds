This grouped variation application consists of three Type II variation applications as follows:

- -Update of the 150 mg SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1, and Package Leaflet based on the results from study CAMN107I2201 (ENESTfreedom): A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in newly-diagnosed patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CMLCP) who achieved a sustained deep molecular response
- -Update of the 150 mg and 200 mg Tasigna SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1, and Package Leaflet based on the results from study CAMN107A2408 (ENESTop): A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in patients with Ph+ CML-CP who achieved a sustained deep molecular response on nilotinib treatment after switching from imatinib treatment.
- -Update of the 200 mg Tasigna SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1, based on the results from study CAMN107A2405 (ENESTcmr): A Phase III open-label, randomised study to evaluate nilotinib or imatinib treatment in patients with Ph+ CML-CP who have not achieved a deep molecular response after previous imatinib therapy.

Additional changes to the Labelling are proposed to comply with the latest QRD template version 10. An updated RMP, version 16, is also provided in this application.

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Tasigna was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/06/375 on 22 May 2016. Tasigna was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: chronic myeloid leukaemia.

The modified  indications,  which  are  the  subject  of  this  application,  fall  within  the  above  mentioned orphan designation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable.

Article 8 of the paediatric regulation does not apply to this application, since the authorised medicinal product  is  not  protected  by  a  supplementary  protection  certificate  under  Regulation  (EC)  No 469/2009 or by a patent which qualifies for the granting of the supplementary protection.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products.

## Protocol assistance

The applicant did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

The current indication for Tasigna is as follows:

Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase (SmPC, section 4.1).

The scope of this grouped variation application was the update of the Tasigna Summary of Product Characteristics  (SmPC)  regarding  the  possibility  of  treatment  discontinuation  in  patients  who  have been  treated  with  Tasigna  (nilotinib)  for  at  least  three  years  and  have  achieved  a  sustained  deep molecular response based on the results from two treatment discontinuation studies, CAMN107I2201 (ENESTfreedom) and CAMN107A2408 (ENESTop).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH  provided a revised ERA. The ERA  based  on studies submitted in the procedure EMEA/H/C/X/28 and as Follow Up Measure (FUM) 039. Furthermore 2 new studies on identification of transformation products occurring in the water-sediment transformation test OECD 308 and the soil degradation test OECD 307 are now included in the ERA.

## 2.2.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

PEC  values  were  refined  based  on  market  prediction  data  for  2022.  Consequently  PEC/PNEC  risk quotients were updated in Phase II.

Based on the scientific information available, the placement of the foreseen amounts of nilotinib on the EU  market  does  not  constitute  any  significant  risk  to  surface  water,  groundwater  and  terrestrial compartments.  However,  in  the  Phase  II-Tier  B  sediment  risk  assessment  a  risk  is  calculated  for nilotinib. It should, however, be taken into consideration that no toxicity was found in the study with the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus riparius in a study following OECD testing guideline 219. In this study the upper testing range was limited by the low water solubility of nilotinib and the results of the study are therefore reported as 'no toxicity up to the limit of water solubility'. Based on this fact,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no reliable conclusion on the risk for the sediment compartment is possible.

Based  on  the  logarithmic  octanol-water  partition  coefficients  of  nilotinib  of  3.6,  a  bioconcentration study  in  fish  has  been  conducted,  resulting  in  a  moderate  bioconcentration  factor  of  127.  This assessment  revealed  that  nilotinib  cannot  be  considered  as  a  PBT  substance  based  on  its  low bioconcentration potential in fish. However, nilotinib can be considered as potentially persistent based on the outcome of the studies on transformation in water-sediment systems and soils. Nilotinib showed a half-life of 179-213 days for the total water-sediment systems (normalized to 12°C) and a half-life of 369 days for soils (normalized to 12°C). Consequently the criteria for a very persistent (vP) substance of 180 days in water-sediment systems and soils defined in the REACh guidance on PBT assessment is exceeded for both compartments.

Proposed structure of the transformation products during soil degradation test according to the study protocol  OECD  307:  Proposed  structure  of  the  transformation  products  during  soil  degradation  test according to the study protocol OECD 307:

## 2.2.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

There is no risk for the aquatic and terrestrial environment. The active ingredient is not considered as PBT substance. However, the active ingredient and its transformation products are very persistent in soil and sediment. The structure of the stable transformation products was proposed in the updated ERA. The conclusion of persistence has been included in the updated ERA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of nilotinib.

- Considering the above data, nilotinib should be used according to the precautions stated in section 6.6 of the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment: Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 2.4.1. Dose response studies

· Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) enrolled patients receiving treatment with nilotinib for newly diagnosed CML-CP. The dose and schedule of nilotinib (300 mg bid) was consistent with the approved first-line indication. Patients who did not tolerate this standard dose but who achieved and/or maintained MR4.5 on a minimum dose of 400 mg once daily continued to be treated at this lower dose of 400 mg once daily at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients who required re initiation of nilotinib treatment because of loss of MMR resumed their previously tolerated nilotinib dose.

· In Study A2408 (ENESTop), Ph+ CML CP patients were allowed to take the same nilotinib dose they were taking prior to study entry. Most patients included in the study were treated with either nilotinib 300 mg or 400 mg bid at study entry. Patients who had achieved and sustained MR4.5 on any dose other than 300 mg/400 mg bid of nilotinib prior to study entry, were also included in the study. The nilotinib 400 mg bid dose is the nilotinib starting dose for second-line treatment.

· In Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) the dose and schedule used (400 mg bid) was consistent with the approved second-line indication.

## 2.4.2. Main studies

##  STUDY I2201 (ENESTfreedom)

(ENESTfreedom)  was  a  Phase  II,  single-arm,  multicenter  study,  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  TFR  in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML-CP who have achieved durable minimal residual disease (MRD) status on first-line nilotinib treatment.

## Methods

## Study participants

Patients had to have received a minimum of 2 years of first-line nilotinib treatment and have ≥ MR4.5, prior  to  study  entry.  During  the  first  52  weeks  of  the  study  (i.e.  the  NTCS  phase),  patients  were treated with the planned dose of 300 mg bid nilotinib (or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg once daily if  required  from  the  perspective  of  tolerance).  Patients  had  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR) assessments every 12 weeks by a Novartis designated laboratory. Patients who achieved durable MRD (i.e.  of  the  4  last  quarterly  PCR  assessments,  the  last  assessment  was  MR4.5,  no  assessment  was worse than MR4.0, and no more than two assessments between MR4.0 and MR4.5) were eligible to start the TFR phase, where nilotinib treatment was suspended. During the TFR phase, BCR-ABL/ABL levels were monitored every 4 weeks during the first 48 weeks, every 6 weeks for the following 48 weeks, and every 12 weeks during the last period. All PCR assessments were performed by a Novartis designated laboratory.

During  the  first  48  weeks  of  the  TFR  phase,  loss  of  MR4.0  triggered  an  intensified  bi-weekly  BCRABL/ABL level monitoring to identify loss of MMR early. Loss of MMR was assessed in a single blood sample  (confirmation  of  loss  of  MMR  was  not  required)  and  mandated  re-initiation  of  nilotinib treatment  at  300  mg  bid  or  at  a  reduced  dose  level  of  400  mg  once  daily  if  required  from  the perspective of tolerance within 5 weeks of the collection date of the blood sample demonstrating loss of MMR.

8.  History  of  acute  pancreatitis  within  one  year  of  study  entry  or  past  medical  history  of  chronic pancreatitis.

9. Known presence of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer.

10. History of another active malignancy within five years prior to study entry with the exception of previous or concomitant basal cell skin cancer and previous carcinoma in situ treated curatively.

11. Patients who had not recovered from prior surgery.

12. Treatment with other investigational agents (defined as not used in accordance with the approved indication) within four weeks of Day 1.

15.  Patients  who  were  currently  receiving  treatment  with  any  medications  that  had  the  potential to prolong  the  QT  interval  and  the  treatment  could  not  be  either  safely  discontinued  or  switched  to  a different medication prior to starting study drug.

16.  Impairment  of  gastrointestinal  (GI)  function  or  GI  disease  that  might  significantly  alter  the absorption of study drug (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection, or gastric bypass surgery).

17. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and  until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive  human  chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test.

18.  Women  of  child-bearing  potential,  defined  as  all  women  physiologically  capable  of  becoming pregnant, unless they were using highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for 14 days after the final dose of nilotinib.

## Treatments

The  study  comprised  three  main  phases:  the  nilotinib  consolidation  (NTCS)  phase  (52  weeks),  the nilotinib  TFR  phase  (up  to  192  weeks  after  the  last  patient  enters  the  nilotinib  TFR  phase)  and  the treatment re-initiation (NTRI) phase (up to 192 weeks after the last patient entered in the TFR phase).

All eligible patients in the treatment phases (NTCS phase, NTRI and NTRI-2 phases and the NTCT and NTCT-P phases) were treated orally with the planned dose of 300 mg nilotinib bid. Dose regimen could be decreased to 400 mg once daily at the discretion of the Investigator in case of study-drug related hematological and non-hematological toxicities.

## Objectives

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable in Study I2201 is the proportion of patients who are in MMR (MR3.0) at 48 weeks after starting the TFR phase defined as the number of patients with MMR at 48 weeks after starting  the  TFR  phase  with  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  re-initiation  of  nilotinib  therapy  in  the  first  48 weeks after starting the TFR phase divided by the number of patients who entered the TFR phase.

The main secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are:

-  Treatment-free survival (TFS) after the start of the TFR phase
-  MR4.5 rate at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase.
-  Time required to regain MMR/MR4.5
-  Progression free survival (PFS) after the start of the TFR phase
-  Overall survival (OS) after the start of the TFR
-  Kinetics of BCR-ABL/ABL transcript levels after restart of nilotinib treatment

The exploratory efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are:

-  Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Patient-reported outcomes and resource utilization (RU)
-  BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR during the TFR phase

## Sample size

Demonstration of successful nilotinib TFR phase was based on a study designed with a 90% power to test the null hypothesis that the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase was &lt; 50% with the alternative hypothesis that the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase was &gt;50%. The sample size was based on Fleming's single stage design to test the null hypothesis H0: p ≤ 0.5, where p was the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase (considering any patient who required re-initiation of treatment as non-responder). If the true rate p ≥ 0.65, then with one-sided alpha level of 2.5% and a power of 90%, a minimum of 122 patients were required to be studied. This study had actually enrolled 216 patients by 20-Dec-2013, the date when the patient enrollment was closed. With 216 patients enrolled, assuming approximately 30% of enrolled patients who had MR4.5 at study entry would not be eligible for starting the TFR phase, there would have been approximately 151 patients entering TFR. Assuming the true rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase would be 65%, with a MMR rate of 50% for the null hypothesis, the study would have a 94% power with one-sided alpha level of 2.5% to test the null hypothesis. The power would have increased by 4% based on the 216 enrolled patients compared to the originally planned 90% power based on the 175 enrolled patients, with all the other assumptions for the power calculation being the same.

## Randomisation

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS. The primary endpoint (rate of successful TFR) was  presented  together  with  an  exact  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence  interval  (CI).  The  null hypothesis was to be rejected if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0.50. The primary analysis was repeated on the PPS as a supportive analysis. All demographic data, medical history and current medical conditions at study start, and disease history were summarized and listed for the FAS and Safety set.

The rate of molecular responses by certain time points after starting the TFR phase as well as the rate of  patients  who  re-achieved  molecular  responses  (MR4.5/MMR)  with  nilotinib  retreatment  were presented together with an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI. Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript levels after re-start of nilotinib therapy were presented by a box-plot of BCR-ABL ratio over time and were also summarized over time.

All  time to event endpoints including duration of treatment re-initiation required to regain MMR and MR4.5, TFS, PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and were presented by KM plots.

All  nilotinib  concentrations  were  listed  using  the  Safety  set.  The  following  is  the  list  of  analyses conducted to investigate the nilotinib concentration- efficacy relationship: Scatter plot of BCR ABL ratio (%) at 48 weeks of the NTCS phase vs. trough nilotinib concentration and the TFR phase entry status was summarized using contingency table by trough nilotinib concentration categories (by quartiles). Safety set was used for all safety analyses. Since the primary interest of the study was to assess the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

benefit of stopping treatment, particular analysis was performed on the patients who entered the TFR phase (TFR Safety set): those analyses focused on the differences of the incidence of safety events (AEs and lab abnormalities) between the NTCS phase and the first 48-weeks of the TFR phase to allow fair comparison.

## Conduct of the study

Protocol amendments

The study protocol was amended three times.

The key features of each amendment are given below.

Amendment 1 (released on 3-Jul-2013): At the time of the amendment the study was in the startup phase; 16 patients had been enrolled as of 20-Jun-2013.

The primary purpose for the amendment was:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To  implement  modifications  as  requested  from  different  Health  Authorities  (HAs)  and  Ethic Committees/Institutional Review Boards (ECs/IRBs) during review of the original protocol.
-  To address feedback from Investigators received during the study startup.

The main points addressed were:

-  Allowed  repeated  pre-screenings  for  BCR-ABL  transcript  level  as  soon  as  possible  when  MR4.5 could not be assessed at pre-screening due to logistical or quality issues which was considered to increase the chance of enrolling patients who were actually eligible for screening/enrollment.
-  According  to  the  Novartis  'Guideline  on  Prevention  of  Pregnancies  in  Clinical  Trials'  for  highly effective  contraception,  monthly  urine  pregnancy  testing  was  included  in  the  assessments schedule. The requirement of using highly effective contraception was changed from 30 to 14 days after the final dose of nilotinib based on the half-life of Tasigna® and the individual variability of metabolism. Additionally the acceptable method of highly effective contraception was corrected for periodic abstinence.
-  The criteria for premature withdrawal and how to proceed if a pregnancy occurred during TFR was clarified.
-  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  amended  to  better  reflect  the  patient  population  to  be included  in  Study  I2201  including  that  patients  must  have  been  treated  for  a  minimum  of  two calendar years with at least the last 12 months prior to pre-screening at the approved total daily dose of 600 mg nilotinib (or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg qd if patients did not tolerate the planned dose).
-  Allowed screening patients from Study EIC01 (ENEST1st) study for participation to Study I2201 without having first  to  discontinue  Study  EIC01.  Patients  would  discontinue  Study  EIC01  only  if they are confirmed eligible for Study I2201. This practice was in compliance with the ICH Topic E8 guidelines as it constituted a 'justified exception'.
-  Dose reduction guidelines for study-drug related non-hematologic toxicity and suggested management  of  selected  AEs  were  updated  to  reflect  the  latest version of the nilotinib [Investigator Brochure] on Management of Ischemic vascular or Cardiovascular Events.
-  Pharmacogenetics study was added to identify factors (i.e. pt. demography, genetic polymorphisms as well as genomic biomarkers) associated with successful TFR of nilotinib therapy. Polymorphisms  known  to  be  associated  with  sub-optimal  response  to  treatment  with  imatinib, nilotinib  or  other  TKI  as  well  as  polymorphisms  proposed  in  the  literature  as  criteria  for discontinuing treatment was tested for their association with successful TFR. These might include polymorphisms in NKp30, members of the KIR family and members of the BCL2 family (such as BIM).
-  To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol.

## Amendment 2 (released on 03-Jul-2014)

The main purposes of the amendment were:

-  To include cholesterol testing in the assessment schedule. Elevations in total serum cholesterol and low  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  was  observed  very  commonly  (more  than  10%)  in  patients treated with nilotinib and commonly (between 1 to 10%) in patients treated with imatinib. Most of the cholesterol elevations were grade 1 (&gt;ULN - 300 mg/dL; &gt;ULN - 7.75 mmol/L) or 2 (&gt;300 400 mg/dL; &gt;7.75 - 10.34 mmol/L), and some elevations were present prior to initiation of CML therapy.  Lipid  profiles  including  total  cholesterol,  LDL-C  and  HDL-C  were  assessed  during  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conduct  of  this  study.  If  test  results  warranted  intervention,  Investigators  followed  their  local standards  of  practice  or  treatment  guidelines  which  recommended  treatment  even  for  grade  1 cholesterol elevation.

Before  prescribing  a  lipid-lowering  medication,  the  possibility  of  drug-drug  interactions  was considered due to moderate inhibitory effect of nilotinib on CYP3A4 isoenzyme that was involved in the metabolic pathway of some statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors).

-  To  provide  a  harmonization  on  dose  reductions  guidelines  across  Novartis-sponsored  Tasigna® study protocols. Hence the dose reduction guidelines for the following non-hematologic toxicities were updated:
- o Pancreatitis grade 4: change from 'Hold therapy' to 'Stop therapy'.
- o QTcF prolongation &gt;480 ms toxicity.
- o Cardiac 'Other': change from 'Hold therapy' to 'Stop therapy'.
-  To incorporate guidance for the management of:
- o Serum cholesterol increased.
- o Blood glucose increased.
- o Other cardiac risk factors.
- o Ischemic vascular or ischemic cardiovascular events occurring in patients treated with nilotinib.
-  To incorporate precaution of use for antacid drugs to be aligned with Tasigna® FDA Prescribing Information and EMA SmPC.
-  To define ischemic vascular and ischemic cardiovascular events as AEs of special interest, and their reporting.
-  To  include  serum  phosphate  testing  in  the  assessment  schedule  to  ensure  consistency  with  the dose reduction guidelines in case of serum hypophosphatemia.
-  To clarify the specification of the statistical alternative hypothesis H1.
-  To  inform  the  IRBs/IECs/REBs  and  HAs  about  over-recruitment  and  its  impact  on  the  stopping rules applied to the first 48 weeks after start of TFR and on the sample size calculation.
-  To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol.

Amendment 3 (released on 30-Jul-2015): At the time of the database lock, the protocol amendment 3 was  yet  to  receive  health  authority  (HA)/Ethics  committee  (EC)/Independent  review  board  (IRB) approval in five countries.

The main purposes of the amendment were:

-  To clarify instructions on when intensified PCR bi-weekly monitoring will be ended if loss of MR4.0 happened after the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase.
-  To more precisely define 'immediate' treatment re-initiation after loss of MMR.
-  To further clarify the early study termination rules during the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase.
-  To  add  a  section  'General  non-hematological  laboratory  toxicity'  to  allow  for  a  distinction  from 'General non-hematology toxicity', for which the described rules must be strictly applied without any  possibility  of  modification  by  the  Investigator.  It  was  necessary  to  introduce  the  section

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'General non-hematological laboratory toxicity' to accommodate an individual assessment by the Investigator  in  some  clinical  situations  such  as  serum  glucose  increase  ≥  grade  2  or  bilirubin increase ≥ grade 2 in Gilbert's patients lasting longer than 28 days even upon dose reduction of study drug, which were not harmful to the patient or was typical, and could be transient during the management of concomitant disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus). In such situations, stopping of study medication might not be appropriate and this new section could avoid that such patients had to be withdrawn from study for medically unjustifiable reasons.

-  To  clarify  that  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  QT  interval  prolonging  agents  are  considered  as prohibited concomitant medications during the whole duration of the study.
-  To include retrospective collection of Sokal risk category at diagnosis parameters.
-  To introduce additional guidance for Investigators to differentiate between patients  who discontinued certain clinical trial protocol elements (e.g., discontinued study treatment, or some or all visits etc.), who withdrew consent or who were lost to follow-up.

## Other changes in study conduct

There were no changes that occurred in the study conduct.

## Changes in planned analysis

The  original  report  and  analysis  plan  (RAP  Module  3)  was  finalized  and  approved  on  02-Apr-2014, which was aligned with protocol Section 10 (including protocol amendment 1).

The RAP Module 3 was amended (Amendment 1) on 22-Sep-2015 before the database lock for the primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis.

-  Added analysis descriptions for the exploratory analyses to identify potential predictive factors for successful TFR.
-  Updated reporting of deaths to also describe causes of deaths (and not only number of deaths) post study discontinuation in the Survival follow-up period.
-  Provided descriptions on summarizing the data for PROs and healthcare resource utilization.

The RAP Module 3 was amended (Amendment 2) on 01-Feb-2016 before the database lock for the primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis:

-  Clarified that in analyses comparing consolidation to TFR, only the first year of TFR will be taken into account to allow fair comparison between the 2 periods;
-  Removed the EQ-5D-5L health index score from planned CSR analyses as it would not be relevant to compute it for the entire study population, but rather only if needed for a specific country/region population and adapted to this particular country/region;
-  Modified the criteria of evaluable PK trough samples for the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) according to PK dosing and sampling date/time;
-  Acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  Sokal  risk  score  data  may  not  be  available  for  a  significant proportion  of  patients  at  the  time  of  primary  analysis  and  that  it  may  not  allow  evaluating  the impact of Sokal risk group on the primary endpoint.

On 24-Mar-2016, after the database lock, the RAP Module 3 was amended (Addendum 1) with the following main changes in the planned analyses:

-  Correct the formulas for calculating the severity score and interference score for MDASI-CML.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Added  exploratory  analyses  to  further  characterize  the  recurrence,  time  to  appearance  and duration of AEs in the grouping musculoskeletal pain.

## Secondary endpoint: PFS after the start of the TFR phase

As of the data cut-off date, three PFS events (all deaths not considered CML-related) were observed after  the  start  of  the  TFR  phase,  and  187  (98.4%)  patients  were  censored  for  PFS  analysis.  The estimated PFS rate at 48 weeks after the start of the TFR phase was 98.9% (95% CI: 95.7, 99.7)

## Secondary endpoint: OS after the start of the TFR phase

As of the data cut-off date, three patients died after the start of the TFR phase (one in the TFR phase and  two  in  the  re-initiation  phase)  and  187  patients  were  alive  and  censored  for  OS  analysis.  The estimated OS rate at 48 weeks after the start of the TFR phase was 98.9% (95% CI: 95.8, 99.7)

## Ancillary analyses

## Analysis of identifying predictors for successful TFR

Successful TFR is defined according to the primary endpoint definition (patients in MMR at 48 weeks of TFR). Various analyses were done to evaluate the impact of potential predictive factors on the primary endpoint (in the FAS population, all patients who entered the TFR phase). In the patients who entered the TFR phase (FAS), between study entry and entry in the TFR phase, there is by protocol a fixed duration  of  52  weeks  during  which  all  patients  in  FAS  had  to  remain  on  nilotinib  treatment  and minimum  residual  disease  before  entering  in  the  TFR  phase.  This  means  that  the  effect  of  1)  the duration of prior nilotinib treatment up to study entry, and 2) of the time from the first MR4.5 up to the time of study entry on whether successful TFR occurred is equivalent to the effect of the time up to TFR entry. Therefore, the conclusions regarding the impact of these factors as analyzed up to study entry can be transposed to that of the same factors up to the TFR entry.

-  Multivariate  logistic  regression  analysis  for  successful  TFR  with  age,  gender,  duration  of  prior nilotinib treatment and time since first MR4.5 until study entry as explanatory variables, did not provide evidence of strong predictors of successful TFR. The Stepwise selection model (with level of 0.1 for both variable entry and stay) selected only one variable, time since MR4.5 until study entry, as a potential predictor of successful TFR (odds ratio 1.027 [95% CI: 1.003, 1.051], [Study I2201-Table 14.2-5.5]).
-  The duration of prior nilotinib treatment before study entry was not shown to be a strong predictor of  successful  TFR  in  this  study,  probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  durations  of  prior  nilotinib treatment did not differ substantially among all patients in FAS (mean [SD]: 32.6 [8.14] months.
-  Baseline  demographics  and  prior  disease  characteristics  were  also  summarized  for  patients  who achieved  successful  TFR  vs.  patients  who  did  not  achieve  successful  TFR  but  it  did  not  show  a notable difference between patients achieving successful TFR and patients without successful TFR.

In summary, no strong predictor of successful TFR was identified. There was no notable difference in baseline  demographics,  disease  characteristics  and  prior  treatment  or  prior  response  characteristics between patients who had successful TFR and patients who did not have successful TFR.

## BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR during the TFR phase

A thorough inventory of clinical BCR-ABL compound mutations associated with TKI resistance reported in  the  published  literature  identified  a  limited  list  of  12  kinase  domain  positions  comprising  the majority of compound mutations, which are referred to as key positions. The key residues in the native BCR-ABL kinase domain are: M244, G250, Q252, Y253, E255, V299, F311, T315, F317, M351, F359, and  H396  (Zabriskie  et  al  2014).  Eighty-nine  patients  (46.8%)  lost  MMR  during  the  TFR  phase. Amongst  these  89  patients,  72  patients  had  at  least  one  evaluable  mutational  analysis  performed. Amongst the 72 patients evaluable for mutational analysis, the BCR-ABL mutation of F359V (mutation of less sensitivity to nilotinib) was detected in one patient (0.5%).

##  STUDY A2408 (ENESTop)

(ENESTop) was a Phase II, single-arm, multi-center study, evaluating the feasibility of TFR post TKI treatment in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML-CP. This study was designed to determine the rate of successful TFR in patients who achieved and maintained MR4.5 on nilotinib.

## Objectives/Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable in Study A2408 was the proportion of patients without loss of MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 within 48 weeks following the start of the nilotinib TFR phase.

The main secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis were:

-  TFS after the start of the TFR phase
-  MR4.5 rate at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase
-  Proportion  of  patients  who  regained  MR4.5  and  MR4  within  the  first  48  weeks  of  the  NTRI phase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Proportion  of  patients  who  regained  MR4.5,  MR4  and  MMR  within  the  first  48  weeks  of  the NTRI phase in patients who re-start treatment due to loss of MMR in the TFR phase
-  Time required to regain MR4 and MR4.5 in patients who re-initiated treatment due to either confirmed loss of MR4 or loss of MMR in the TFR phase
-  Time required to regain MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 in patients who re-initiated treatment due to loss of MMR
-  PFS after the start of the TFR phase
-  OS after the start of the TFR
-  Kinetics of BCR-ABL/ABL transcript levels after restart of nilotinib treatment

The exploratory efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are:

-  Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint
-  Patient-reported outcomes and resource utilization
-  BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 during the TFR phase.

## Sample size

The study was designed with a 90% power to test the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis was that the rate of no documented confirmed loss of MR4, no loss of MMR and no re-initiation of nilotinib therapy in the first 48 weeks after nilotinib TFR was 10% or less with an alternative hypothesis that this rate is &gt;10%.

The sample size was based on an exact test for single proportion to test the null hypothesis; H0: p ≤ 0.10,  where  p  was  the  rate  of  no  documented  confirmed  loss  of  MR4,  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  reinitiation of nilotinib therapy in the first 48 weeks after nilotinib cessation. If the true rate p ≥ 0.25, then with one-sided alpha level of 2.5% and a power of 90%, a minimum of approximately 70 patients were required to enter the TFR phase after the NTCS phase. Based on the results of the ENESTcmr study, approximately 30% of patients were to experience a loss of MR4.5 once it was achieved during the NTCS phase. Considering an additional 10% attrition rate, it was assumed that approximately 40% of the patients would not be eligible for TFR after 52 weeks of the NTCS phase. Thus, approximately 117 patients were to be enrolled into this study.

The study was expected to close at the earlier of the date on which 70 patients had entered the TFR phase or the date on which 117 patients had been enrolled in the NTCS phase. This study had enrolled 163 patients  by  13-Dec-2013, the  date  when  the  patient  enrollment  was  closed.  With  163  patients enrolled, assuming approximately 40% of enrolled patients who had MR4.5 at study entry would not be eligible for starting the TFR phase, there were to be approximately 98 patients who entered TFR.

Assuming  that  the  true  rate  of  no  documented  confirmed  loss  of  MR4,  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  reinitiation of nilotinib therapy in the first 48 weeks after nilotinib cessation was 25%, with a 10% rate for the null hypothesis, the study had a 97% power with 1-sided alpha level of 2.5% to test the null hypothesis. The power increased by 7% based on the 163 enrolled patients compared to the originally planned 90% power based on the 117 enrolled patients with all the other assumptions for the power calculation being the same.

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS. The primary endpoint (rate of successful TFR) was  presented  together  with  an  exact  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence  interval  (CI).  The  null hypothesis was to be rejected if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0.10. The primary analysis was repeated on the PPS as a supportive analysis. All demographic data, medical history and current medical conditions at study start, and disease history were summarized and listed for the FAS and Safety set.

The rate of molecular responses by certain time points after starting the TFR phase as well as the rate of  patients  who  re-achieved  molecular  responses  (MR4.5/MR4/MMR) with  nilotinib  retreatment  were presented together with an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI. Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript levels after re-start of nilotinib therapy were presented by a box-plot of BCR-ABL ratio over time and were also summarized over time.

All time to event endpoints including duration of treatment re-initiation required to regain MMR, MR4 and MR4.5, TFS, PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and were presented by KM plots.

All  nilotinib  concentrations  were  listed  using  the  Safety  set.  The  following  is  the  list  of  analyses conducted to investigate the nilotinib concentration- efficacy relationship: Scatter plot of BCR ABL ratio (%) at 48 weeks of the NTCS phase vs. trough nilotinib concentration and the TFR phase entry status was summarized using contingency table by trough nilotinib concentration categories (by quartiles). Safety set was used for all safety analyses. Since the primary interest of the study was to assess the benefit of stopping treatment, particular analysis was performed on the patients who entered the TFR phase (TFR Safety set): those analyses focused on the differences of the incidence of safety events (AEs and lab abnormalities) between the NTCS phase and the first 48-weeks of the TFR phase to allow fair comparison

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments

The study protocol was amended two times. The key features of each amendment are given below:

Amendment 1 (released on 07-Jul-2013): At the time of the amendment the study was in thestartup phase; 21 patients had been enrolled as of 25-June-2013.

Primary purpose for the amendment included but not limited to:

-  To allow patient access to both clinical and commercial drug supply. Source of the drug supply was expected to change during the course of the study. However, all drug supply used in the study continued  to  be  provided  free  to  the  patients  by  Novartis.  In  addition,  protocol  changes  were implemented to address questions identified during the study startup as below:
-  To clarify the pregnancy language to ensure consistency across all nilotinib clinical trials including instructions on how to deal with pregnancy during the TFR phases.
-  Allowed  for  extension  of  screening  window  from  14  days  to  28  days  to  allow  more  time  for screening procedures.
-  To clarify duration of imatinib therapy prior to switch to nilotinib.
-  Allowed screening of patients from AMN107A2405 (ENESTcmr) or Study AMN107EIC01 (ENEST1st) study for participation in this study without having first to discontinue from either study. Patients would  discontinue  from  these  studies  only  if  they  were  confirmed  eligible  for  the  current  study AMN107A2408. This practice was in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Topic E8 guidelines as it constituted a 'justified exception one of which being that the patients in both these studies were treated and will continue to be treated with the same drug,  nilotinib  (Tasigna®),  at  the  same  dose/same  formulation  in  the  approved  indication  as  in current study AMN107A2408.
-  Allowed  earlier  re-screening  of  patients  by  reducing  re-screening  window  from  12  weeks  to approximately four weeks ± 7 days
-  Clarification  provided  to  ensure  monitoring  of  AEs  for  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study treatment or last day of the TFR/TFR-2 phase. In addition, SAEs were to be followed until clinical improvement, resolution, or stabilization.
-  Biomarker and pharmacogenetics sections were included
-  Study title was updated to include the pathology (CML added) of study population.
-  Information added to the definition of adequate end organ function for direct bilirubin
-  Clarification was provided to serious adverse event (SAE) reporting regarding safety assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Amendment  2 (11-Aug-2014):  At  the  time  of  this  amendment,  163  patients  were  screened  for enrollment as of December 2013

The main purposes of the amendment were:

-  To include cholesterol testing in the assessment schedule. Elevations in total serum cholesterol and  low  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  was  observed  very  commonly  (more  than  10%)  in patients  treated  with  nilotinib  and  commonly  (between  1  to  10%)  in  patients  treated  with imatinib. Most of the cholesterol elevations were grade 1 (&gt;ULN - 300 mg/dL; &gt;ULN - 7.75 mmol/L) or 2 (&gt;300 - 400 mg/dL; &gt;7.75 - 10.34 mmol/L), and some elevations were present prior to initiation of  CML therapy. Lipid profiles including total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C were  assessed  during  the  conduct  of  this  study.  If  test  results  warranted  intervention, Investigators followed their local standards of practice or treatment guidelines which recommended  treatment  even  for  grade  1  cholesterol  elevation.  Before  prescribing  a  lipidlowering medication, the possibility of drug-drug interactions was considered due to moderate inhibitory effect of nilotinib on CYP3A4 isoenzyme that was involved in the metabolic pathway of some statins (Hydroxy Methyl-Glutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors).
-  To provide a harmonization on dose reductions guidelines across Novartis-sponsored nilotinib study  protocols.  Hence  the  dose  reduction  guidelines  for  the  following  non-hematologic toxicities were updated:
-  Hepatobiliary
-  Ischemic cardiovascular evaluation for grade 2 and above to Hold therapy and refer patient for assessment; patients with grade 2 resumed treatment at lower dose on event improving to grade 1and patients with grade 3/4 discontinued treatment.
-  Pancreatitis grade 4: change from 'Hold therapy' to 'Stop therapy'.
-  Cardiac QTcF prolongation to include instructions for Investigator to follow local guidelines for management of QTcF.
-  Cardiac 'Other': change from 'Hold therapy' to 'Stop therapy'.
-  To incorporate guidance for the management of:
-  Serum cholesterol increased.
-  Blood glucose increased.
-  Other cardiac risk factors.
-  Ischemic vascular or ischemic cardiovascular events occurring in patients treated with nilotinib.
-  To incorporate precaution of use for antacid drugs to be aligned with Tasigna® Food and Drug Administration Prescribing Information and European Medicines Agency SmPC.
-  To define ischemic vascular and ischemic cardiovascular events as AEs of special interest, and their reporting.
-  The duration of the TFR phase was clarified to be up to 192 weeks after the last patient enters TFR throughout the protocol.
-  Modifications to clarify the biomarker assessments
-  To clarify the specification of the statistical alternative hypothesis H1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To inform the IRBs/IECs/REBs and HAs about over-recruitment and its impact on the stopping rules applied to the first 48 weeks after start of TFR and on the sample size calculation.
-  To clarify the biochemistry laboratory parameter for calcium
-  Modification of the Pharmacokinetic endpoint and corresponding PK blood collection log
-  Retrospective Sokal risk score collection was included
-  To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol.

## Changes in planned analysis

The original  report  and  analysis  plan  (RAP  Module 3)  was  finalized  and  approved  on  30-June-2014, which was aligned (including protocol amendment 1).

The RAP Module 3 was amended (Amendment 1) on 25-Sep-2015 before the database lock for the primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis:

-  Added analysis description for the exploratory analyses to identify potential predictive factors for successful TFR;
-  Updated reporting of deaths describing causes of deaths (and not only number of deaths) post study discontinuation in the Survival follow-up period;
-  Added analysis to assess patient proportions who had MR4.5 at 48 weeks without reinitiation of nilotinib therapy, after starting the TFR phase.

The RAP Module 3 was amended (Amendment 2) on 31-Jan-2016 before the database lock for the primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis:

-  Clarified that in analyses comparing consolidation to TFR, only the first year of TFR was taken into account to allow fair comparison between the 2 periods;
-  Removed  the  EQ-5D-5L  health  index  score  from  planned  CSR  analyses  as  it  would  not  be relevant to compute it for the entire study population, but rather only if needed for a specific country/region population and adapted to this particular country/region;
-  Modified the criteria of evaluable PK trough samples for the PAS according to PK dosing and sampling date/time;
-  Acknowledged the fact that  the  Sokal  risk  score  data  may  not  be  available  for  a  significant proportion of patients at the time of primary analysis and that it may not allow evaluating the impact of Sokal risk group on the primary endpoint;
-  Clarified that a patient with a detectable p190 BCR-ABL transcript or any other minor BCR-ABL transcript  (any  atypical  transcript  for  CML  patients,  different  than  the  p210  major  BCR-ABL transcript  which  is  the  typical  transcript  for  the  CML  patients)  are  considered  as  a  nonresponder at all time-points in the study.
-  The RAP Module 3 was amended (Addendum 1) on 22-Mar-2016 after the database lock for the primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis:
-  Correct the formulas for calculating the severity score and interference score for MDASI-CML.
-  Added exploratory analyses to further characterize the AE grouping musculoskeletal pain. The protocol  mentions  that  PFS  on  study  including  the  survival  follow-up  period  and  OS  will  be determined separately in patients who did not enter the TFR phase. However, this analysis was not  included  in  the  RAP  as  the  main  focus  is  for  patients  who  entered  the  TFR  phase.  In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

addition, this analysis is irrelevant as no patients progressed and only one patient died, in the NTCS phase.

Secondary endpoint: PFS

As of the data cut-off date, none of the 126 patients in the TFR phase had a PFS event (progression to AP/BC or death) and all patients were censored for PFS analysis

## Secondary endpoint: OS

As of the data cut-off date, all of the 126 patients in the TFR phase were alive.

## Ancillary analyses

## Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint

Analysis of predictors for successful TFR is defined according to the primary endpoint definition (no loss of MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 by 48 weeks of TFR). Various analyses were done to evaluate the impact of potential predictive factors on the primary endpoint, in the FAS population, for all patients who entered the TFR phase. In the patients who entered the TFR phase (FAS), between study entry and entry in the TFR phase, there is by protocol a fixed duration of 52 weeks during which all patients in FAS had to remain on nilotinib treatment and maintained MR4.5 before entering in the TFR phase. This means that the effect of 1) the duration of prior TKI treatment up to study entry, and 2) of the time  from  the  first  MR4.5  up  to  the  time  of  study  entry  on  whether  successful  TFR  occurred  is equivalent to the eff ect reported up to the time of TFR entry. Therefore, the conclusions regarding the impact of these factors as analyzed up to study entry can be transposed to that of the same factors up to TFR entry.

-  Multivariate logistic regression analysis for successful TFR with age, gender, duration of prior TKI treatment, time to first MR4.5 on nilotinib prior to study entry, time since first MR4.5 until study entry, and starting dose level in the consolidation phase as explanatory variables, did not provide evidence of strong predictors of successful TFR.
-  The  Stepwise  selection  model  (with  level  of  0.1  for  both  variable  entry  and  stay)  selected gender  (odds  ratio  0.523  [95%  CI:  0.251,  1.087])  and  time  since  MR4.5  until  study  entry (odds ratio 1.019 [95% CI: 0.999, 1.040]) as the 2 factors most correlated with successful

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TFR, but for both of them, the CI for the odds ratio included one and they are not considered as clear predictive factors.

-  The median duration on TKI treatment prior to study entry was similar in patients who had successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (74.5 vs 75.9 months).
-  The median duration on nilotinib treatment prior to study entry was higher in patients who had successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (44.9 vs 36.1 months). Similarly, the  time  since  first  achievement  of  MR4.5  until  study  entry  was  higher  in  patients  who  had successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (27.10 vs 17.20 months).

There  was  no  notable  difference  in  baseline  demographics,  disease,  and  prior  treatment  or  prior response  characteristics  between  patients  who  had  successful  TFR  and  patients  who  did  not  have successful TFR.

## STUDY A2405 (ENESTcmr)

This study was already assessed in detail in an earlier variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/00798/II/0061) and thus, discussion focus only one main issues relevant for this application. Overall, this study adds no further data on the discontinuation issue and thus, supportive value is only low.

For these reasons study ENESTcmr will not be re-assessed, but high-level results will be provided.

Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) was an open label, randomized study of nilotinib vs. standard imatinib conducted between 2009 and 2012 in adult patient with CML-CP. The primary objective of the study was to compare the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR within the first year of study therapy with nilotinib or imatinib. Furthermore, this trials aims to assess the kinetics of CMR achieved and to compare PFS in both treatment arms as key secondary endpoints. This study was assessed and discussed extensively already during a previous procedure in 2014 (EMEA/H/C/00798/II/0061). Therefore, only a short summary is provided here. The dose and schedule used (400 mg bid) was consistent with the approved second-line indication.

Patients initially randomized to imatinib were offered the opportunity to crossover to nilotinib therapy following treatment failure (loss of CCyR, loss of MMR, or progression to AP/BC), or 2 years after CMR had not been attained. No crossover was provided for patients randomized to the nilotinib arm.

Yearly updates of the efficacy and safety results were planned for the duration of the study. The efficacy data presented in the submission is up to 48 months which was marking the end of the treatment period by protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Cross-over from imatinib to nilotinib was permitted only at the end of year 2 for patients without CMR

The secondary endpoints were to be tested at the 5% significance level, only when the primary endpoint was significant at the 5% level. As the primary endpoint was not significant, for the secondary efficacy endpoints reported, p-values are provided for descriptive purposes only and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The rate of the CMR at Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 during the first two years of treatments and the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR by month 24 and the rate of maintained CMR at Month 12 and 24 were presented along with the 95% confidence interval by treatment groups.

The primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR during first 12 months. The rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR during the first 12 months was 12.5% in the nilotinib arm and 5.8% in the imatinib arm. The study did not meet the primary endpoint as the p-value for the two-sided CMH test was p=0.1083, which was above the required significance level of 0.05. However, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.096 in favor of nilotinib, these results were suggestive of the potential clinical benefit associated with nilotinib in this patient population.

A 2-sided stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test was used to test the null hypothesis (of no difference in the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR between treatment arms) at the 0.05 significance level.

2 Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test is stratified by prior imatinib treatment and interferon use.

The insufficient difference between the two treatment groups and lack of statistical significance at the early 12-month time point was attributed to the kinetics of molecular response which could not have been accurately predicted at the time of the study conception/design.

In accordance with the predefined statistical procedure described in the protocol, the secondary endpoints would only formally be tested at the two-sided α-level of 0.05 if the primary analysis reached statistical significance at Month 12. As the primary efficacy endpoint did not attain statistical significance, all other endpoints reported in the clinical study report were presented with nominal pvalues, unadjusted for multiplicity, which are not reported here.

Longer-term follow-up of the primary endpoint provided compelling results at the 24-month analysis with an odds ratio of 2.103 (95% CI: 0.932, 4.742) and rates of confirmed CMR were 23.1% and 10.7%, respectively for the nilotinib and imatinib arms. Given the kinetics of molecular response, this analysis provides a more appropriate assessment of the two treatments under evaluation than the primary efficacy endpoint up to Month 12 [Study A2405 Table 14.2-5.4]. By 36 and 48 months, considering the responses up to crossover, nilotinib continued to have a higher number of patients achieving these deep molecular responses relative to continuing treatment.

## Confirmed best cumulative CMR and unconfirmed MR4.5 (ITT)

The below analysis followed intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, i.e., even if patients achieved response only after  crossover from imatinib to nilotinib, the response was credited to the arm to which they were randomized (imatinib). In line with the study design, it impacts results from Month 36 and 48 time points, where the difference between treatment arms tends to diminish because of patients originally randomized to imatinib who improved after switching to nilotinib.

Rates of confirmed best cumulative CMR up to Month 24 were 23.1% and 10.7%, respectively, for the nilotinib and imatinib treatment arms, with an OR of 2.103 (95% CI: 0.932, 4.742).

Rates of confirmed best cumulative CMR up to 36 months were 27.9% and 20.4%, for the nilotinib and imatinib  arms,  respectively,  with  an  OR  of  1.458  (95%  CI:  0.754,  2.821).  Rates  of  confirmed  best cumulative  CMR  up  to  48  months  were  30.8%  and  20.4%,  for  the  nilotinib  and  imatinib  arms, respectively, with an OR of 1.660 (95% CI: 0.869, 3.171).

The rate  of  best  cumulative  MR4.5  by  Month 24  was  45.2%  in  the  nilotinib  arm  and  24.3%  in  the imatinib  arm  (OR=2.682,  95%  CI:  1.436,  5.009),  by  Month  36  the  rates  were  49.0%  and  38.8% respectively, and by Month 48 the rates were 53.8% and 44.7%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients who were not known to have CMR at baseline, the rates of unconfirmed CMR by 24 month were 32.7% and 18.0%, respectively, for the nilotinib and imatinib treatment arms, by Month 36 the rates  were  40.6%  and  31.0%,  respectively,  and  by  Month  48  the  rates  were  44.6%  and  33.0%, respectively.

For patients who were without MR4.5 at baseline, the rate of unconfirmed MR4.5 by 24 months on study was 42.9% in the nilotinib arm and 20.8% in the imatinib arm, by Month 36 the rates were 46.9% and 36.5%, respectively, and by Month 48 the rates were 52.0% and 41.7%, respectively.

## Confirmed CMR and unconfirmed MR4.5 up to crossover

On or before the 48-month PCR assessment, a total of 46 patients in the imatinib arm crossed over to nilotinib.  Considering  imatinib  patients  who  achieved  confirmed  CMR  for  the  first  time  after  the crossover to nilotinib as non-responders to imatinib, the rate of best cumulative confirmed CMR up to 48 months was 30.8% in the nilotinib arm and 11.7% in the imatinib arm (OR=3.069; 95% CI: 1.450, 6.495).

Out of 46 crossed over patients, 9 patients (19.6%) achieved confirmed CMR for the first time after crossover to nilotinib.

The rate of cumulative unconfirmed MR4.5 up to 48 months (up to cross-over) was 53.8% in nilotinib arm and 32.0% in the imatinib arm (OR=2.578; 95% CI: 1.442, 4.607).

The rate of cumulative unconfirmed CMR up to crossover was 46.2% in nilotinib arm and 21.4% in the imatinib arm (OR=3.313; 95% CI: 1.773, 6.192).

Cumulative molecular response up to cross-over by baseline molecular response status showed that a higher proportion of patients in nilotinib arm achieved various levels of response compared to imatinib arm, when patients did not have the corresponding level of response at baseline Table 4-6.

## Progression-free survival

Two patients (1.9%) in the nilotinib treatment arm and one patient (1.0%) in the imatinib arm had a PFS event. In the nilotinib arm, one patient died due to acute myocardial infarction, another patient died due cardiopulmonary failure and in the imatinib arm one patient died due to prostate cancer with bone metastasis [Study A2405-Table 14.2-2.4.1.1].

No patients progressed to AP/BC. No PFS events were reported after crossover.

## Event-free survival (EFS)

A total of 17 patients experienced an EFS event (loss of CCyR, loss of MMR or death), with a higher number in the imatinib arm (10 patients) compared to the nilotinib arm (7 patients). Of these patients, five patients experienced loss of MMR and two patients died in the nilotinib arm. In the imatinib arm, the  observed  EFS  events  (up  to  crossover)  were  loss  of  MMR  (four  patients),  loss  of  CCyR  (three patients) and death (one patient) and two patients experienced loss of MMR following crossover [Study A2405-Table 14.2-3.2.2]. The reasons for deaths in both arms are explained in the PFS description.

## Overall survival

Three patients (2.9%) in the nilotinib arm and three patients (2.9%) in the imatinib arm died during the study [Study A2405-Table 14.2-2.6.1].

## Time to achievement of response

Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  time  to  achievement  of  response  was  consistently  earlier  for  the patients in the nilotinib arm (MR4.5: 24 months, 95% CI: 14.8, 47.5; CMR: 38.5 months, 95% CI: 26.3, 49.2), while in the imatinib arm the KM estimate of median time to achieve MR4.5 and CMR was 49.0 months (95% CI: 34.3, 49.0) and 49.0 months (NA, NA), respectively [Study A2405-Table 14.23.2.1], [Study A2405-Figure 14.2-3.1.3], and [Study A2405-Figure 14.2-3.1.1].

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Not applicable.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Both the ENESTfreedom and the ENESTop studies are single-arm phase II studies in CML-CP patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ENESTfreedom was a multicentre phase II, single-arm, multi-center nilotinib TFR study in patients with BCR-ABL1 positive CML-CP, who had achieved durable minimal residual disease (MRD) status on firstline nilotinib treatment. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients who were in  MMR  at  48  weeks  after  starting  the  TFR  phase.  The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  clearly  defined  a patient population suitable for this study. Patients were treated with 300 mg bid or 400 mg once daily in case of tolerability issues, which is in line with clinical practice, however most of the patients were treated with 300 mg bid. The protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses are few and minor;  none  of  them  was  considered  critical.  The  median  age  was  55  year  and  only  20%  of  the patients  are  above  65  years.  The  majority  of  the  patients  were  Caucasian,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Only  one patient was ECOG 2. The majority of the patients had a missing Sokal risk score, which was collected retrospectively after protocol amendment 3. In conclusion, the baseline characteristics showed a welltreated, fit and relatively young patient population.

The ENESTop was a phase II, single-arm, open- label study of TFR in CML-CP patients after achieving sustained  MR4.5 on  nilotinib.  The  inclusion  criteria  defined  a  patient  population  that  had  received  at least 4 weeks of initial therapy with imatinib, and then switched to nilotinib for at least 2 years. Patients must have been treated with a TKI for at least 3 years. Patients with a confirmed MMR4.5 prior switch to  nilotinib  were  excluded.  Patients  were  not  to  have  documented  MR4.5  at  the  time  of  switch  from imatinib to nilotinib. The primary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients without loss of MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 within 48 weeks following nilotinib cessation. The MAH had defined one primary  and  several  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints.  The  cut-off  level  in  relation  the  primary endpoint was 10%. The protocol amendments and changes in the planned analysis were not considered critical. There were only few critical protocol deviations. The median age was 56 year and only 27% of the patients are above 65 years. The majority of the patients are Caucasian, ECOG 0 or 1. The Sokal risk  score,  which  was  collected  retrospectively  after  protocol  amendment,  was  missing  in  41.3%.  In conclusion, the baseline characteristics showed  a  well-treated,  fit and  relatively  young  patient population. The median duration of imatinib treatment prior to nilotinib treatment was 23.5 months in the ENESTop study, ie. almost 2 years.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## ENESTfreedom

The primary endpoint was not met, thus the study in principle failed due to a lower limit of the 95%CI below the 50% cut-off. However, as seen in relation to the secondary endpoints, several interesting observations  were  made.  A  large  proportion  of  the  patients  maintained  a  deep  molecular  response (MMR4.5), and about 50% of the patients never relapsed suggesting a potential for cure. If relapse occur,  it  occurred  within  24  weeks  in  the  majority  of  the  patients.  When  relapsed  patients  are  retreated,  98.8%  of  them  regained  MMR  by  24  weeks.  This  is  reassuring.  PFS  and  OS  data  are immature.

## ENESTop:

The study met its primary objective, showing TFR of 57.9%, where the 95%CI is 48.85-66.7%. The MAH has chosen 10% as the reference value above which the lower limit of the 95% CI  had to be, which is lower than the cut-off level in the ENESTfreedom study (50%), however, since the aim in this study is 'no documented loss of MR4, no loss of MMR' the lower cut-off is justified. The majority of patient that enter TFR phase, but eventually relapse, do so within 24 weeks. About 50% of patients continue  to  be  in  the  TFR  phase  for  more  than  90  weeks.  This  is  very  interesting  from  a  clinical perspective.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of patients regained MR4 and MR4.5 within 24 weeks, and by 48 weeks 100% of the patients  have  regained  MR4  and  94.8%  have  regained  MR4.5.  Thus,  it  seems  that  MMR  can  be achieved upon retreatment after a TFR phase. As in the ENESTfreedom study, the PFS and OS data are immature.

With respect to the data currently available it is of upmost importance to have well defined criteria for the safe and most promising discontinuation of TKI on the one hand, and, on the other, to increase the number of patients available for such an attempt. The MAH has proposed stringent eligibility criteria to be used in discontinuation of the drug, as well as guidance for frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL levels. The  criteria  are  consistent  with,  some  being  even  more  conservative,  than  the  ones  used  in  the previously published TKI treatment discontinuation studies. The criteria are accordingly reflected in the SmPC  sections  4.2  and  4.4.  The  MAH  has  evaluated  previously  published  studies  in  CML  patients. Among  studies  evaluating  TKI  discontinuation  (Saussele  2016,  Hughes  2016),  only  one  patient progressed  to  BC.  In  the  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  trials,  none  of  the  patients  who  re-initiated nilotinib therapy progressed to AP/BC. Characterizing patients who are at increased risk of relapse and how to monitor them is crucial. However, the MAH could not identify potential prognostic factors, when multivariate  analysis  was  performed.  The  risk  of  developing  resistance  to  the  drug  (ie.  nonresponsiveness)  when  re-treated  was  evaluated.  In  the  published  literature  as  well  as  in  the  study trials, the vast majority of patients who needed re-treatment with TKI did so during the first year after discontinuation,  and  most  commonly  during  the  first  6  months  after  discontinuation.  The  patients responded  well  and  achieved  MMR  in  a  timely  manner.    By  evaluating  the  published  literature,  no patient has developed TKI resistance in TFR that was detected during TKI re-initiation. Further data in the  present  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  trials  did  not  suggest  any  resistance  mechanisms  of  the treatment-free interval.

There is continuously growing evidence, which shows that TKI discontinuation could be considered, if the patients are and have been in deep molecular remission for certain period of time, and that patient that relapse, can be safely brought back to remission upon re-initiation of TKI treatment. International guidelines (NCCN guidelines Version 2.2017, CML) provide the option of treatment discontinuation with TKI, if strict criteria are fulfilled.  From a clinical point of view a discontinuation or interruption of TKI treatment is considered a benefit to the patients, provided that a treatment free period conveys no increased  risk  to  the  patient,  the  suggested  criteria  are  used,  and  the  patients  are  being  closely monitored  by  BCR-ABL  for  a  whole  life  time.  Updated  data  from  96  weeks  support  the  primary findings, however, further data generated over significantly longer periods than currently available are still  needed  and  should  be  provided  post-approval  (see  Risk  Management  Plan).  Even  during  longlasting TFR, persistent CML stem cells are detectable using genomic analyses, but currently the clinical implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells is unknown and an active area of research. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of genomic PCR methods to detect patientspecific  gene  fusions,  analysis  of  BCR-ABL  at  the  DNA  level  has  been  limited  and  thus,  detecting persistent CML stem cells using these methods do currently not trigger any change in the management of the disease. However, the MAH should collect data on gene signature on patients that relapse on TFR compared to patients that relapse on treatment (see Risk Management Plan).

Discontinuation  of  treatment  may  be  considered  in  eligible  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+) CML  patients  in  chronic  phase  who  have  been  treated  with  nilotinib  at  300  mg  twice  daily  for  a minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy (SmPC section 4.2).

The measures proposed below are adequate in view of the remaining uncertainties about long-term

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outcomes. A precautionary approach with intensive monitoring until the remaining uncertainties can be addressed is justified (see Risk Management Plan).

Eligible  patients  who  discontinue  Tasigna  therapy  must  have  their  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  and complete blood count with differential monitored monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the second  year,  and  every  12  weeks  thereafter.  Monitoring  of  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  must  be performed with a quantitative diagnostic test validated to measure molecular response levels on the International  Scale  (IS)  with  a  sensitivity  of  at  least  MR4.5  (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032%  IS)  (SmPC section 4.2).

For  patients  who  lose  MR4  (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01%IS)  but  not  MMR  (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.1%IS) during the treatment-free phase, BCR-ABL transcript levels should be monitored every 2 weeks until BCR-ABL levels return to a range between MR4 and MR4.5. Patients who maintain BCRABL levels between MMR and MR4 for a minimum of 4 consecutive measurements can return to the original monitoring schedule (SmPC section 4.2).

Patients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known to have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg once daily if the patient had a dose reduction prior to discontinuation of therapy. Patients who re-initiate nilotinib therapy should have their BCR-ABL transcript levels monitored monthly until MMR is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (SmPC section 4.2).

Taken together, the present data are clinically relevant and are reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

## Additional expert consultation

Following  the  CHMP request, a Scientific  Advisory  Group  meeting  was  convened  on  5  April  2017 to provide advice on the following list of questions:

## 1.  Please  discuss  the  potential  value  of  treatment-free  remission  (TFR)  as  currently proposed compared to continued treatment in Ph+ CML patients in the present treatment landscape.

In principle, avoiding unnecessary treatment, especially if not well-tolerated, is an important goal in the treatment of CML. Avoidance of toxicity may be an important goal in up to about 30% of patients. However,  one  needs  to  balance  this  goal  against  the  risk  of  additional  anxiety  due  to  a  perceived higher risk of loss of remission, as well as the burden of intensive monitoring, which may result for example in frequent visits to the hospital and frequent laboratory examinations. It is also important to promote the option of treatment-free periods to CML patients and relevant healthcare professionals in a  balanced  way,  avoiding  the  misconception  that  unless  MR4.5  or  better  is  achieved  (to  allow treatment-free  remission)  this  is  perceived  by  patient  as  'treatment  failure'.  Thus,  adequate information about benefits, risks, uncertainties, follow-up and patient preferences will play a key role in the treatment decision.

From a physician's perspective, while avoiding unnecessary treatment is an important goal, the burden of intensive monitoring also requires careful consideration, taking into account the need to use high quality laboratory testing of molecular response according to agreed international standards, such as the laboratory recommendations, developed as part of the European Treatment and Outcome Study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(EUTOS) for CML, which may not be readily available everywhere in Europe.

## 2.  Please  discuss  if  the  precautionary  measures  provided  in  the  SmPC  are  adequate  with regard to the monitoring of disease activity and the re-initiation of nilotinib.

Currently, the measures proposed are adequate in view of the remaining uncertainties about long-term outcomes (longest follow-up is currently about 12 years for nilotinib; about 16 years for imatinib) as well  as  the  need  not  to  deviate  significantly  from  the  measures  used  in  the  available  studies.  A precautionary approach with intensive monitoring until the remaining uncertainties can be addressed is justified. However, efforts to optimise treatment duration and follow-up should continue (see answer to question No. 3).

Strict adherence to the proposed measures should be encouraged since there is a risk that practical considerations may lead to less intense monitoring than is needed and ultimately in delays in detecting loss  of  remission.  The  risk  management  plan  should  consider  if  measures  are  needed  to  address potential issues with monitoring compliance.

Formally introducing treatment-free periods for nilotinib with changes to the SmPC is likely to have an impact on treatment duration and follow-up of other TKI inhibitors that currently do not allow such an approach as part of the SmPC. In principle, this approach might be applicable to other TKIs and in particular  to  imatinib.  However,  there  may  be  small  differences  between  TKIs  (for  instance  shorter time to and greater depth of response may allow shorter treatment duration before stopping) and also differences in the burden of long-term toxicity motivating the treatment-free approach (for instance, the increase in vascular events with nilotinib is continuous with no plateau). Thus, direct extrapolation of the approach among TKIs is not possible.  For imatinib and to a lesser extent dasatinib, academic studies addressing TFR are available/ongoing and are likely to influence clinical practice albeit without the rigour of regulatory assessment and agreed risk management measures. Whether this should be addressed at the level of clinical guidelines and/or regulatory assessment (even if based on published data)  can  be  debated  (clinical  guidelines  already  include  detailed  recommendations  for  follow-up) although  a  rigorous  regulatory  assessment  is  encouraged  in  view  of  the  evolving  level  of  evidence, remaining uncertainties, and the potential need to introduce adequate risk-minimisation measures.

## 3. Please discuss whether the data that we already have are sufficient, or whether the CHMP should  pursue  the  generation  of  additional  clinical  data  to  confirm  the  longer-term outcomes in patients who discontinue treatment when in deep molecular response.

Further data are needed with longer follow-up (beyond 48 months), to confirm the reported plateau without event after 48 months, and to further optimise duration of treatment and follow-up, including further research into dynamics of relapse, factors associated with loss of remission, and development of nilotinib resistance. Studies should be run examining potential differences in patterns of resistance on TKI treatment (including TKI-induced clonal selections) - or off TKI treatment; detailed biological characterizations (e.g., molecular; drug transporter expression and other biological pathways) of the on/off  treatment  relapses  is  essential  to  add  value  in  understanding  the  potentially  different mechanisms in these two scenarios.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop studies provided results indicating that it is possible to discontinue TKI treatment despite the fact that OS and PFS data are immature.  Discontinuation of treatment may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be considered in eligible Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy. The precautionary measures included  in  the  SmPC  are  adequate  with  regard  to  the  monitoring  of  disease  activity  and  the  reinitiation of nilotinib.

Results from both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop studies do not merit an extension of the indication as initially proposed by the MAH, but are acceptable, to be reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

About 10400 patients and healthy volunteers  have been  exposed in  clinical  studies.  Post-marketing experience is available from more than 39300 patients with CML since approval in 2007.

Additional  safety  data  is  based  on  data  from  215  patients  in  Study I2201  (ENESTfreedom),  163 patients  from  Study A2408  (ENESTop),  and  101 patients  from  Study A2405  (ENESTcmr)  at  the recommended 400 mg bid (second-line treatment) or 300 mg bid dosing regimen (first-line treatment) of nilotinib. Of note in Study I2201, patients who did not tolerate the dose of 300 mg bid were treated at 400 mg once daily, and in Study A2408 patients who achieved and sustained MR4.5 on any dose other than 300 mg/400 mg bid of nilotinib prior to study entry, were also included in the study.

This  overall  safety  evaluation  is  based  on  data  from  patients  who  have  been  exposed  to  nilotinib. Study I2201  and  Study A2408  enrolled  a  highly  selected  population  of  patients  who  had  tolerated nilotinib  for  at  least  two  years  before  entering  the  consolidation  phase  for  one  additional  year  of exposure.  The  safety  data  collected  during  the  consolidation  phase  may  thus  be  different  from  the known safety profile of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients who are initiating treatment with nilotinib. However, this one-year consolidation period is a good reference to compare the patient's safety during the TFR phase with that during the previous nilotinib therapy. Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) enrolled highly selected patients who had demonstrated tolerability to imatinib and had been treated with imatinib for at least two years prior to study entry, whereas the patients randomized to nilotinib were exposed to nilotinib for the first time in the context of the clinical trial. Collectively, the data allows for assessment of  the  safety  profile  of  nilotinib,  provides  safety  information  regarding  AEs  that  may  occur  upon discontinuation of nilotinib, and assesses the safety of treatment re-initiation in patients requiring such therapy.

## NTCS and TFR phases (TFR Safety set)

As  of  the  data  cut-off  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  nilotinib  in  the  NTCS  phase  was  52.14 weeks, range: 8.6 to 57.6 weeks. 95.3% of the patients were exposed to nilotinib for ≥ 48 weeks. The median duration of exposure to nilotinib in the NTCS phase for patients who entered the TFR phase (TFR Safety set) was also 52.14 weeks (range: 50.0 to 57.6 weeks). As of the data cut-off, the median

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duration of the TFR phase (from the start day of the TFR phase to the last day of the TFR phase) was 49.4 weeks (range: 8.4 to 85.0 weeks). The median duration of TFR phase (restricted to the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase) was 48.0 weeks (range: 8.4 to 48.0 weeks).

Most patients in the NTCS phase, and patients in the NTCS phase who entered the TFR phase, received the  actual  dose  that  was  close  to  the  assigned  daily  dose.  The  median  actual  dose  intensity  in  the NTCS phase was 600 mg/day (25-75th percentile: 599.2 to 600.0 mg/day).

As  of  the  data  cut  off,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  nilotinib  for  patients  in  the  NTRI  phase (n=86) was 39.6 weeks (range: 5.0 to 69.7 weeks).

## Study A2408 (ENESTop)

Exposure to nilotinib was considered to be appropriate to allow for an adequate assessment of safety. Since the primary interest of this study is to understand the benefit of treatment discontinuation with nilotinib  in  patients  having  achieved  deep  molecular  response,  particular  emphasis  is  placed  on  the median duration of the TFR phase, which is considered appropriate to allow assessment of safety upon nilotinib discontinuation.

## Study A2405 (ENESTcmr)

Up  to  the  cut-off  date,  the  median  time  on  treatment  (from  first  day  of  treatment  to  last  day  of randomized treatment) was 47.2 months in the nilotinib arm; and 37.0 months and 26.7 months in the 400 mg and 600 mg once daily cohorts of the imatinib arm.

Median  time  on  treatment  with  nilotinib  after  crossover  (from  first  day  of  nilotinib  treatment  after crossover to last day of treatment) for crossover patients (n=46) was 662.5 days (21.8 months).

Up to the cut-off date, the median actual dose intensity was 775.7 mg/day in the nilotinib treatment arm; and 400.0 mg/day and 600 mg/day in the two dose cohorts of the imatinib treatment arm. The median actual dose intensity was 790.4 mg/day for the patients that crossed over to nilotinib.

## Adverse events

## Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom)

In the safety set, nearly all patients (93.0%) had at least one AE, 18.6% of patients had an SAE, 4.7% of  patients  had  an  AE  that  lead  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug,  and  5  patients  died  during  'all phases' of the study.

## Most frequently occurring adverse events in Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom)

Adverse  events  (all  grades)  were  reported  in  83.2%  of  patients  in  the  NTCS  phase  (TFR Safety set) as compared to 65.8% of patients in the TFR phase (TFR Safety set) . These were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

primarily grade 1/2 AEs. The AEs that were reported at a higher incidence by preferred term (≥ 3% difference) in the NTCS phase (TFR Safety set) compared to the TFR phase were: hypophosphatemia (+6.8% difference), hypertension (+4.2% difference), cough (+3.7% difference), rash (+3.7% difference), and bronchitis (+3.2% difference). The most frequent grade 3/4 AEs reported in the NTCS phase (TFR Safety set) were: hypertension (5.3%), hypophosphatemia (1.6%), and lipase increased (1.1%). The AEs that were reported at a higher incidence by preferred term (≥ 3% difference) in the TFR phase compared to the NTCS phase (TFR Safety set) were: arthralgia (+3.7% difference), pain in extremity (+3.7% difference), and myalgia (+3.6% difference).  The most frequent  grade  3/4  AEs  reported  in  the  TFR  phase were:  hypertension,  arthralgia,  lipase increased, dyspnea, and peripheral arterial occlusive (1.1% each).

## Most frequently occurring adverse events in Study A2408 (ENESTop) in the NTCS and TFR phases in

## trial A2408 (ENESTop):

For the 126 patients who entered the TFR phase, the incidence of AEs was comparable in the NTCS and the TFR phases (77% and 73.8%, respectively). The preferred terms that were reported at a higher incidence (≥ 3% difference) in the NTCS phase (TFR Safety set) compared to the TFR phase were:  constipation  and  rash  (+4.8%  difference  each);  and  eczema  and  gastroenteritis  (+3.2% difference  each).  Grade  3/4  AEs  reported  in  at  least  two  patients  in  the  NTCS  phase  were: hypertension  (3.2%),  lipase  increased  (2.4%),  pneumonia  (1.6%),  atrial  fibrillation  (1.6%),  and hepatotoxicity  (1.6%).  The  preferred  terms  that  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥  3% difference)  in  the  TFR  phase  compared  to  the  NTCS  phase  (TFR  Safety  set)  were:  arthralgia (+16.7%  difference),  myalgia  (+9.5%  difference),  musculoskeletal  pain  (+5.5%  difference), increased weight (+4.8% difference), cough (+4% difference), and oral herpes (+3.2% difference). Grade  3/4  AEs  reported  in  at  least  two  patients  in  the  TFR  phase  were:  hypertension  (1.6%); cellulitis (1.6%), and carpel tunnel syndrome (1.6%).

The AEs reported that were reported at a higher incidence by preferred term in the nilotinib group compared  to  the  imatinib  group  (≥  10%  difference)  were:  headache  (+30%  difference),  rash (+25.8%  difference),  pruritus  (+29.7%  difference),  dry  skin  (+19.8%  difference),  constipation (14.9% difference), elevated ALT (+13.9% difference), myalgia (+12% difference), alopecia (10.9% difference), and pain in extremity (10% difference). The most common grade 3/4 event reported in association with nilotinib was lipase increased (in 11.9% of patients) (Table 5-9).

In the group of patients who had crossed-over to nilotinib, the most frequently occurring AE was rash in 9 patients (19.6%) followed by ALT increased, headache and pain in extremity in 8 patients (17.4%) each. The AE headache in two patients was of grade 3/4 severity.

1 N is the number of patients from the TFR Safety set.

## Study A2405 (ENESTcmr)

Serious adverse events were reported more frequently for patients receiving treatment with nilotinib (21 patients, 20.8% vs. 16 patients, 15.5% for the imatinib group). The incidence of specific SAEs was low for both treatment groups and all events reported were single cases with the exception of atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, cellulitis, nephrolithiasis and pleural effusion, where two patients from the imatinib treatment group reported this event.

## Deaths

## Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom)

A total of five patients died during the study by the data cut-off date; two (0.9%) patients died during the NTCS phase, one (0.5%) patient died during the TFR phase, and two (2.3%) patients died during the NTRI phase . The reasons for deaths were cardiac arrest (one patient) and completed suicide (one patient) during the NTCS phase, death-unknown reason (one patient) during the TFR phase, and acute myocardial infarction (one patient), and death-unknown reason (one patient) during the NTRI phase.

## Study A2408 (ENESTop)

One patient (0.6%) died during the course of the study. This death occurred on treatment during the NTCS phase of the study and the cause of death was arterial hemorrhage.

## Study A2405 (ENESTcmr)

Of  the  204  patients  in  the  Safety  Set,  as  of  the  24-month  cut-off  date,  one  patient  in  the  nilotinib group  died  due  to  an  event  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  within  28  days  following  study  drug discontinuation. The event was of grade 4 severity and suspected to be related to study drug by the Investigator.

Up to the 48-month cut-off date, two additional on treatment deaths have been observed (one in the nilotinib group due to cardiopulmonary failure and one in the imatinib group due to metastases to the peritoneum.  Three  patients  died  more  than  28  days  after  study  drug  discontinuation  (one  in  the nilotinib  group  due  to  liver  failure  from  light  chain  deposition  and  two  in  the  imatinib  group  due  to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer with bone metastasis).

## Safety in special populations

Not applicable.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There are no drug-drug interactions studies included in this submission.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom)

The AEs leading to discontinuation were infrequent (4.7% of all the patients in the Safety set). The incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase were 2.8% and 4.7%, respectively. The AEs leading to discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase were  cardiac  arrest,  muscular  weakness,  cerebrovascular  accident,  agitation,  eczema,  xanthelasma, intermittent claudication, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

The AEs leading to discontinuation reported in the NTRI phase were coronary artery disease, uvulitis, chest pain, blood cholesterol increased, hyperglycemia, breast cancer, intermittent claudication, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The incidence of AEs requiring dose adjustment or interruption reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase were 5.6% and 12.8%, respectively.

## Study A2408 (ENESTop)

The AEs leading to discontinuation were infrequent (6.1% of all the patients in the Safety set). The incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase were 3.1% and 7.8%, respectively. The AEs leading to discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase were acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, arterial hemorrhage, hypertension, and peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  reported  in  the  NTRI  phase were  necrosis,  hypercholesterolemia,  adenocarcinoma,  pleural  effusion,  and  pleural  fibrosis.  The incidence of AEs requiring dose adjustment or interruption reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase were 17.2% and 15.7%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study A2405 (ENESTcmr)

The  proportion  of  patients  reporting  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  significantly higher in the nilotinib group (21 patients, 20.8%) compared to the imatinib group (7 patients, 6.8%). With the exception of lipase increased which was reported in two patients, all other preferred terms were  reported  in  only  one  patient  each.  In  the  nilotinib  group,  11  patients  (10.9%)  experienced  a grade 3/4 event resulting in discontinuation of study drug. In the imatinib group, 5 patients (4.9%) were  discontinued  due  to  a  grade  3/4  AEs.  After  crossover,  20  patients  (43.5%)  had  an  AE  that required dose adjustment or dose interruption, of which 10 patients (21.7%) had a grade 3/4 event [Study A2405-Table 14.3.1- 4.1.2]. In 15 patients (32.6%) (7 patients grade 3/4) these events were suspected to be related to study drug.

## Post marketing experience

The post-marketing experience with nilotinib was reviewed and reported by the MAH and discussed at CHMP on an ongoing basis during the last 11 PSURs /data cut-off: 31 Jan 2016).

Relevant  publications  containing  important  new  safety  information  published  during  the  reporting interval  were  retrieved  from  the  three  publicly  accessible,  bibliographic  databases  Medline,  Embase and Biosis Previews. The search criteria was inclusive of pregnancy outcomes (including termination) with  no  adverse  outcomes,  use  in  pediatric  populations,  compassionate  supply,  named  patient  use, lack of efficacy, asymptomatic overdose, abuse or misuse, medication error where no AEs occurred, or 'near misses' and important non-clinical safety results.

The results of the literature review did not reveal any important articles. Although there are multiple publications of musculoskeletal pain after imatinib discontinuation, there was a single presentation by Berger  et  al  at  ASH  2015  that  reported  two  patients  with  musculoskeletal  pain  after  nilotinib discontinuation.

Based on the review, except for the single oral presentation, there were no new or significant safety findings related to Tasigna published in the peer-reviewed scientific or made available as unpublished manuscripts during the reporting interval.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of nilotinib is well-known after many years on the market. In the current setting with TFR, the interesting issue is not the exposure in itself, but the opposite. Nonetheless, patients are exposed for considerable period before entering the TFR phase. The exposure and non-exposure (in TFR) are deemed appropriate to compare the safety, when patients are treated with nilotinib and when patient are in TFR.

In general, there are more AEs during the NTCS phase compared with the TFR phase, however, the number of Grade 3/4 AEs is similar between the two phases in the ENESTfreedom, while slightly higher in the NTCS phase in the ENESTop study. All AEs occurred with a lower or similar frequency in the TFR phase, except for AEs related to muscles and extremity pain.  Musculoskeletal pain which included arthralgia, pain in the extremity, myalgia, bone pain and spinal pain are observed in CML patients, when TKIs are discontinued. This could be a withdrawal symptom. The MAH evaluated the published literature; most of the data are only short communications. The frequency ranged from 5% to 46%, the wide range may be due to differences in study design, outcome definitions etc., although about 1/3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of the patients had symptoms. The median time to first occurrence was 1-6 weeks (in the published literature) and 8.3 and 9.5 weeks in the ENESTfreedom and ENESTop trials respectively. The pains were easily manageable in the clinic, either resolved spontaneously or by using analgesics. The possible mechanism of musculoskeletal pain after TKI discontinuation is not clear. By reviewing the literature, the MAH referred to data, indicating that increased values of the circulating Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFβ) were reported in patients who experienced musculoskeletal pain after TKI discontinuation. It is not clear if PDGFβ was the causative factor or rather a marker of pain in these patients. Another report hypothesized that the cKIT and PDGF might be involved.

Dose tapering was not allowed in the two trials. However the nilotinib treatment exposure data during the consolidation phase were similar in the patients with vs. patients without musculoskeletal pain in the TFR phase. Re-initiation of nilotinib treatment was only performed in case of molecular relapse and never in order to manage the musculoskeletal pain.

From a clinical point of view a discontinuation or interruption of TKI treatment is considered a benefit to  the patients,  provided that a treatment free period conveys no increased risk to the patient, the suggested criteria are used, and the patients are being closely monitored by BCR-ABL for a whole life time.  Updated  data  from  96  weeks  support  the  primary  findings,  however,  further  the  MAH  should collect and provide data on late relapses on a yearly basis from the ongoing studies ENESTfreedom and ENESTop (see Risk Management Plan). Risk of resistance (in TFR) is classified as potential risk in the risk management plan. Even during long-lasting TFR, persistent CML stem cells are detectable using genomic analyses, but currently the clinical implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells is unknown and an active area of research. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of genomic PCR methods to detect patient-specific gene fusions, analysis of BCR-ABL at the DNA level has been limited and thus, detecting persistent CML stem cells using these methods do currently not trigger any change in the management of the disease. However, the MAH should collect data on gene signature in patients who relapse on TFR compared to patients who relapse on treatment and provide data on a yearly basis (see Risk Management Plan).

There seems to a higher likelihood of SAEs in the NTCS in ENESTop, but this is not the case in the ENESTfreedom. The number of SAEs is in general low, and no apparent pattern can be observed. There are very few deaths. However, there is no indication of increased risk of death during TFR.

With regard to AESIs, a similar pattern is observed in both studies: the most striking difference is seen with regard to fluid retention and musculoskeletal pain, where a considerable higher numbers are seen in the TFR phase. This seems to be a withdrawal symptom of TKIs in CML patients.

After discontinuation of Tasigna therapy within the framework of attempting treatment-free remission (TFR), patients may experience musculoskeletal symptoms more frequently than before treatment discontinuation, e.g., myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal pain (SmPC, section 4.8).

In ENESTfreedom study with newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (N=190), musculoskeletal symptoms were reported within a year of Tasigna discontinuation in 24.7% versus 16.3% within the previous year on Tasigna treatment (SmPC, section 4.8).

If a woman who is being treated with nilotinib is considering pregnancy, treatment discontinuation may be considered based on the eligibility criteria for discontinuing treatment. There is a limited amount of data on pregnancies in patients while attempting treatment-free remission (TFR). If pregnancy is planned during the TFR phase, the patient must be informed of a potential need to re-initiate treatment with Tasigna during pregnancy (SmPC section 4.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of nilotinib is well known for many years. All AEs occurred with a lower or similar frequency in the TFR phase, except for AEs related to muscles and extremity pain.  Musculoskeletal pain is observed in CML patients, when TKIs are discontinued, the mechanism is not clearly understood, but they were usually well manageable in the clinical setting.

It is fully acknowledged that otherwise discontinuation could be helpful in reducing the impact of adverse events.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 16 was acceptable.

However, following the SAG oncology held on the 5 th  of April 2017 and further discussion on the risk of developing resistance off-therapy, the CHMP requested the inclusion of 2 post-authorisation safety studies to the pharmacovigilance plan in order to collect and provide data on late relapses on a yearly basis from ongoing studies ENEST-op and ENEST-freedom and to collect and provide data on gene signature on patients that relapse on TFR compared to patients that relapse on treatment.

The aim of those 2 studies is to address the newly added safety concern 'risk of resistance (in TFR)', which has been included as missing information.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 19.1 with the following content:

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated based on the results of Studies CAMN107I2201 and CAMN107A2408. Particularly, a new warning with regard to special monitoring of Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained deep molecular response has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Additional changes to the labelling were implemented to comply with the latest QRD template version 10.

During the procedure the MAH withdrew the PI changes related to Study CAMN107A2405 (ENESTcmr) that were proposed as part of the application as the CHMP was of the view that it was not relevant for these data to be reflected in the SmPC.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) showed a rate of successful TFR at 48 weeks of 51.6% (95% CI: 44.2, 58.9). The majority of patients who lost MMR or discontinued the TFR phase did this early during the first  24  weeks of the TFR phase. The KM estimated TFS rate at 48 weeks is 53.1% (95% CI: 45.7, 59.9). In patients who lost MMR in the TFR phase, nilotinib re-treatment was started in 86 patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

but one patient failed to regain MMR. The time to regain MMR was rapid with a KM estimated median time of 7.9 weeks (95% CI: 5.1, 8.0). No patient progressed to CML-AP/BC or had a haematological relapse of CML-CP.

In Study A2408 (ENESTop) the rate of successful TFR at 48 weeks was 57.9% (95% CI: 48.8, 66.7). The majority of patients who lost MMR or had a confirmed loss of MR4 did so during the first 24 weeks of the TFR phase. The KM estimated TFS rate at 48 weeks is 58.7% (95% CI: 49.6, 66.7). Fifty-one patients restarted treatment due to confirmed loss of MR4 or loss of MMR in the TFR phase, of whom 48 patients (94.1%) achieved again MR 4 or MR4.5.  Three patients failed in regaining MR4.5. The time to regaining MR4 and MR4.5 was rapid: KM estimated median of 12.0 weeks (95% CI: 8.3, 12.7) and 13.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.4, 16.1) respectively. No patient progressed to CML-AP/BC.

Updated data from 96 weeks confirmed the findings at 48 weeks.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There is a concern about the patients that did not respond adequately when re-exposed to nilotinib upon relapse. The MAH has not been able to identify any prognostic factors that could predict relapses and specifically not early relapses and, even more important, resistant relapses. Due to small numbers of  late  relapses,  it  was  not  possible  to  study  the  potential  prognostic  factors  for  early  versus  late relapses. The main concern is related to the risk of resistance development off therapy.

Based on the above, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should collect and provide data late relapses on yearly basis from ongoing studies ENEST-op and ENEST-freedom and should also collect data on gene signature on patients that relapse on TFR compared to patients that  relapse on treatment on yearly basis (see Risk Management Plan).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of  nilotinib  is  well-known  after  many  years  on  the  market  no  new  or  unexpected safety signals were observed during the use of nilotinib. In the current setting with TFR, the interesting issue is not the exposure in itself, but the opposite. Increasing rates of musculoskeletal pain after TKI discontinuation  seems  to  be  the  most  import  new  signal  identified  from  trials  ENEST  freedom  and ENESTop. This AE seems to be probably a class specific AE and was observed more frequently after nilotinib discontinuation than during treatment; however they were usually manageable in the clinical setting.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Musculoskeletal  pain  is  observed  in  CML  patients,  when  TKIs  are  discontinued.  This  could  be  a withdrawal  symptom,  but  the  mechanism  behind  is  not  clearly  understood.  Updated  safety  showed that the incidence of musculoskeletal pain is significantly reduced from 48 to 96 weeks. In addition, such symptoms were easily managed in the clinical setting, and they resolved either spontaneously or by using analgesics.

Taking into account that the introduction of specific TKIs like imatinib has tremendously improved the prognosis  of  CML,  it  is  important  not  to  jeopardise  this  benefit  by  discontinuation  the  treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  provided  the  use  of  the  suggested  eligibility  criteria  and  careful  monitoring  the  BCR-ABL levels for the whole life time, it is considered a safe and manageable procedure in at least some CMLCP patients.

The main concern is related to the risk of resistance development off therapy which is discussed above and reflected in the risk management plan.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop showed that discontinuation of treatment with nilotinib should be considered in eligible Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After discontinuation of nilotinib therapy, patients may experience musculoskeletal symptoms more frequently than before treatment discontinuation, e.g., myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal pain. However these symptoms were easily managed in the clinical setting, and they resolved either spontaneously or by using analgesics.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The introduction of TKIs have changed the natural history of CML from being a life-threatening disease which could only be cured by an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with the risks it entail, to a chronic disease with practically a normal life expectancy. The patients are however often faced with life-long treatment with TKIs.

As seen by the data, about 50% of the patients stay in MMR and do not relapse, those who relapse do so  within  24  weeks,  and  if  patients  are  re-treated,  deep  durable  remission  can  be  achieved  in  the majority of patients for more than 90 weeks.

The CHMP considered the opportunity for TFR safe and interesting from a clinical perspective, making it  possible to eliminate acute and chronic side effects due to TKIs, minimizing drug interactions and also making reproduction possible, without exposure to TKIs. Patients that enter the TFR phase seem to  have  withdrawal  symptoms.  These  are  manageable  and  mainly  related  to  musculoskeletal  pain. Notwithstanding, whilst the benefit of a treatment discontinuation are evident, ascertainment that a treatment free period conveys no increased risk to the patient is paramount. Several issues have been addressed. In the published literature, the vast majority of patients who needed re-treatment of TKI did so during the first year after discontinuation, and most commonly during the first 6 months after discontinuation. These data confirmed, that the patients responded well to re-treatment with TKI, with the vast majority achieving MMR in a timely manner and no patients has developed TKI resistance in TFR  that  was  detected  during  TKI  re-initiation.  The  data  submitted,  did  not  suggest  the  resistance mechanisms  to  be  a  consequence  of  the  treatment-free  interval.  When  multivariate  analyses  were performed for successful TFR at 24 weeks, with age, gender, duration of TKI treatment prior to study entry, and time since first MR4.5 until study entry, the MAH could not identify any prognostic factors that could predict relapses, and specifically not early relapses. Due to small numbers of late relapses, it was not possible to study the potential prognostic factors for early versus late relapses.

Published data on time to AP/BC in patients with poor control of CML are very limited, and confined to trials investigating TKIs in CML patients who did not have an optimal response /failure or intolerance to imatinib. Only a few patients progressed to AP/BC. The risk of progression to AP/BC is increased in CML  patients  receiving  second  line  TKIs  as  compared  to  newly  diagnosed  patients.  The  question whether  TKI-treated  CML  patients,  including  those  with  treatment  discontinuation  periods  can  be considered cured still need to be addresses by data generated over significantly longer periods than currently  available.  Even  during  long-lasting  TFR,  persistent  CML  stem  cells  are  detectable  using genomic analyses, but currently the clinical implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells is unknown and an active area of research. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of genomic PCR methods to detect patient-specific gene fusions, analysis of BCR-ABL at the DNA level has been limited and thus, detecting persistent CML stem cells using these methods do currently not trigger  any  change  in  the  management  of  the  disease.  However,  inclusion  of  genomic  analyses  of those patients who discontinued successfully currently for 12 months should be considered in order to allow a better separation of patients who may have a higher relapse risk during the follow up.

The MAH initially proposed changes in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results  from the  three  studies.  However,  the  results  from  both  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  do  not justify a change in 4.1, but should be reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variations accepted   | Variations accepted                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC based on the results from:

- Study CAMN107I2201 (ENESTfreedom: A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in newly-diagnosed patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) who achieved a sustained deep molecular response;
- Study CAMN107A2408 (ENESTop): A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in patients with Ph+ CML-CP who achieved a sustained deep molecular response on nilotinib treatment after switching from imatinib treatment; The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Additional changes to the labelling were implemented in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

An updated RMP, version 19.1, was agreed during the procedure.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 5. EPAR changes
