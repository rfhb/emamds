1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0077     | Submission of the final report from the registry based healthcare database study linked to PASCO (PMS-830-07-0043)) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is an observational study on the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with renal anaemia treated with erythropoietin-zeta as compared with erythropoietin-alpha and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 06/07/2017   | n/a          |                   | The submitted study is a registry based health care database study (HDBS-study) linked to PASCO (Post- Authorisation Safety Cohort Observation of Epoetin zeta Administered Intravenously for the Treatment of Renal Anaemia). The study aimed to compare the crude incidence rate (with 95% CIs) of thromboembolic events in patients with renal anaemia treated with epoetin zeta vs. other epoetins (including epoetin alpha). Overall, no increased thromboembolic risk for epoetin zeta compared to the other epoetins in clinical practice can be derived from the data provided. No new safety concern associated with epoetin zeta was identified. The findings did not warrant changes to the product information. |

| II/0036   | Addition of the indication \" Retacrit can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications. Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. Hb 10-13 g/dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1800 ml)\" in section 4.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmpC). Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet, outlining the mode of administration, contraindications, undesirable effects, special warnings and precautions for use, have been updated as a consequence. Furthermore, Annex II has been updated in order to include the new version number of the Risk Management Plan (version 8.0) and has been aligned in accordance with the latest QRD template (version 7.3.1, March 2010). Minor editorial changes have also been implemented. C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or   | 23/06/2011   | 26/07/2011   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | In this application, the MAH submitted data from a phase III study (411-54-07-08-0000) comparing efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity) of subcutaneously administered test and reference product in patients with renal anaemia to support an extension of the current indication to the use of epoetin zeta as an alternative to blood transfusions in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications. The CHMP considered the extrapolation of efficacy and safety data to the new indication, licensed for the reference product, acceptable based on demonstrated similarity in physicochemical characteristics, efficacy and safety to the reference product; same mechanism of action/ receptor involved, and the absence of additional/unique safety concerns in the new indication. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated. The Package Leaflet was also updated accordingly.   |

| II/0022 | This variation concerns an update of the SPC following the completion of a class safety review by the PhVWP and the CHMP. As a result, CHMP requested to update section 4.4 of the SPC to include more information on PRCA in patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon, ribavirin and epoetin and section 5.1 to include additional data on the Cochrane meta-analysis and the effects of epoetins in cancer patients. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/11/2009 | 23/12/2009 | SmPC and PL     | As a result of the discussion of the updated RMPs and the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis it was agreed at the PhVWP/CHMP meeting in September 2009 that all MAHs for epoetins should submit a type II variation to amend the SPC. Information with respect to the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis on the effects of epoetins in cancer patients and to the occurrence of PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin should be included into the SPC. |

|         | initiated because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. The package leaflet has also been updated accordingly. The MAH also took this opportunity to perform some minor changes in section 6.4 of the SPC, in the Package Leaflet and in the outer labelling and to amend the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.   |            |     | because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.
