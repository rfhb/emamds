The results were observed when the two doses were given either 21 days apart or 6 months apart. A single dose of A/Vietnam AS03 adjuvanted vaccine followed by a dose of A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia AS03 adjuvanted vaccine at Month 6 elicited haemagglutinin inhibition responses to homologous and heterologous booster strains that met and exceeded the CHMP criteria at Month 6 + 7 days post-boost with further increments at Month 6 + 21 days. Therefore based on immunogenicity and safety data, the product information was updated to reflect that two doses of AS03- adjuvanted vaccine given 6 months apart give comparable immune responses after the second dose to two doses given 21 days apart. The PL was updated further to a test performed to increase its readability. authorised |
