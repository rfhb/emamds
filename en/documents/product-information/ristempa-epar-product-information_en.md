ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ristempa 6 mg solution for injection.

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 ml solution for injection.  The concentration is 10 mg/ml based on protein only**. *Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). ** The concentration is 20 mg/ml if the PEG moiety is included. The potency of this product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or nonpegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1 Excipient(s) with known effect: Each pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E420) Each pre-filled syringe contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium (see section 4.4). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. Clear, colourless solution for injection. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Ristempa therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or haematology.

## Posology

One 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Ristempa is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Ristempa is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Ristempa in children has not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made

The onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil count may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances Ristempa should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment given (see section 4.8).

Patients with renal impairment No dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end stage renal disease. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Limited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for pegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (see section 5.1). However, the long-term effects of Ristempa have not been established in acute myeloid leukaemia; therefore, it should be used with caution in this patient population. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro . The safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML); therefore, it should not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. The safety and efficacy of Ristempa administration in de novo AML patients aged  55 years with cytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. The safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose chemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. Pulmonary adverse events Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100) pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF administration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk (see section 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Glomerulonephritis

Glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended.

## Capillary leak syndrome

Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration and is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).

<!-- image -->

Splenomegaly and splenic rupture Uncommon but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and uncommon cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal cases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia Treatment with Ristempa alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. Sickle cell anaemia Sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease (see section 4.8).  Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing Ristempa in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical parameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicine with splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. Leukocytosis White blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 10 9 /l or greater have been observed in less than 1% of patients receiving Ristempa.  No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported.  Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after administration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicine.  Consistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 10 9 /l after the expected nadir, this medicine should be discontinued immediately. Hypersensitivity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in patients treated with Ristempa. Permanently discontinue Ristempa in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer Ristempa to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of antibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low.  Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all biologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.

The safety and efficacy of Ristempa for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or healthy donors has not been adequately evaluated.

The needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions.

## Pregnancy

Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. Ristempa contains sorbitol.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Ristempa contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'. In order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade name of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, Ristempa should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy.  In clinical trials, Ristempa has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of Ristempa with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models concomitant administration of Ristempa and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically investigated in clinical trials. The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. The safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas. Specific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not indicated an interaction of Ristempa with any other medicinal products. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ristempa is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

Women who become pregnant during Ristempa treatment are encouraged to enrol in Amgen's Pregnancy Surveillance Programme. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the Package leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

There is insufficient information on the excretion of Ristempa / metabolites in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Ristempa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

Women who are breast-feeding during Ristempa treatment are encouraged to enrol in Amgen's Lactation Surveillance programme. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the Package leaflet.

Fertility Pegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative weekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body surface area) (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Ristempa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [≥ 1/10]) and musculoskeletal pain (common).  Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics. Hypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, flushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with Ristempa (uncommon [≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100]).  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving Ristempa (uncommon) (see section 4.4). Capillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below. Splenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. Splenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.4). Uncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4).

Paediatric population

The experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger children aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 years respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was bone pain (see section 5.1 and 5.2).

Description of selected adverse reactions Uncommon cases of Sweet's syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying haematological malignancies may play a role. Uncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with Ristempa. The mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving Ristempa is unknown. Injection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100)) as well as injection site pain (common events ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with Ristempa. Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] &gt; 100 x 10 9 /l) have been reported (see section 4.4). Reversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated clinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, with no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving Ristempa following cytotoxic chemotherapy. Nausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. Uncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following cytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. Common cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. Cases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post marketing setting with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Single doses of 300 µg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy volunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse events were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim .

In a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on the incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy regimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of pegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (Day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared with placebo (1% versus 17%, p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use associated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group compared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p  0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p  0.001).

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code:  L03AA13 Human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.  Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Pegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes.  Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.  As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells.  G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro . In two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of pegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of 11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to result in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile neutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile neutropenia was 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated patients (difference 7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a weightadjusted dose (100 μg /kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI -0.36, 0.30). The overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18% of patients treated with filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%,-1.1%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

A small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de novo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was estimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).

In a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients receiving 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 ) was observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (75%) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim occurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  The elimination of pegfilgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose. Pegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes saturated at higher doses.  Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1). Figure 1.  Profile of Median Pegfilgrastim Serum Concentration and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) in Chemotherapy Treated Patients after a Single 6 mg Injection Due to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not expected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment.  In an open label, single dose study (n = 31) various stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. Elderly people Medicinal product no longer authorised

Limited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years) is similar to that in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who received 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy.  The youngest age group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (± Standard Deviation) (47.9 ± 22.5 μg·hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 ± 13.1 μg·hr/ml and 29.3 ± 23.2 μg·hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group (0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of doxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected pharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement. There were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim subcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo loss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen when pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that pegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, oestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by pegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. 6.

## Ristempa 6 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe

## pegfilgrastim

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if their symptoms of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Ristempa is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Ristempa 3. How to use Ristempa 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Ristempa 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Ristempa is and what it is used for Ristempa contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli .  It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. Ristempa is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells).  White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection.  These cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease.  If white blood cells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. Your doctor has given you Ristempa to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. 2. What you need to know before you use Ristempa Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Do not use Ristempa

-  if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, E. coli derived proteins, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ristempa:

-  if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin that itch
-  have an allergy to latex. The needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex and may cause severe allergic reactions
-  experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

 if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: -swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness These could be symptoms of condition called 'Capillary Leak Syndrome' which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4.  get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a problem with your spleen (splenomegaly)  have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung infiltration)  are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely  have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely.  if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Ristempa can harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Ristempa, unless instructed by your doctor. Loss of response to pegfilgrastim If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise pegfilgrastim's activity. Other medicines and Ristempa Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy and breast--feeding

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  Ristempa has not been tested in pregnant women.  It is important to tell your doctor if you:

-  are pregnant;
-  think you may be pregnant; or
-  are planning to have a baby.

## 4. P ossible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Please tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:

-  swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.

These could be symptoms of an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) condition called 'Capillary Leak Syndrome' which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.

<!-- image -->

Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  bone pain. Your doctor will tell you what you can take to ease the bone pain.  nausea and headaches. Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  pain at the site of injection.  general aches and pains in the joints and muscles.  some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. Your white blood cell count may become high for a short period of time. Your platelet count may become low which might result in bruising. Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  allergic-type reactions, including redness and flushing, skin rash, and raised areas of the skin that itch.  serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face).  increased spleen size.  spleen rupture.  Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is important that you contact your doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the abdomen or left shoulder pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen.  breathing problems.  If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing please tell your doctor.  Sweet's syndrome (plum-coloured, raised, painful lesions on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with fever) has occurred but other factors may play a role.  cutaneous vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin).  damage to the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis).  redness at the site of injection. Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ristempa 6 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe

## pegfilgrastim

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if their symptoms of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Ristempa is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Ristempa 3. How to use Ristempa 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Ristempa 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Ristempa is and what it is used for Ristempa contains the active substance pegfilgrastim.  Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli .  It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. Ristempa is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells).  White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection.  These cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease.  If white blood cells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. Your doctor has given you Ristempa to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. 2. What you need to know before you use Ristempa Medicinal product no longer authorised
