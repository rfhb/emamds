## 1. Introduction

Rituximab  is  a  chimeric  murine/human  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to  CD20,  a  hydrophobic transmembrane protein which is present on the cell surface of pre-B- and mature B-lymphocytes, but not on hemopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. In particular, CD20 is present on malignant B-cells in most patients with mature B-cell lymphoma and leukemia. Rituximab binds to CD20 on B-lymphocytes and leads to elimination of these cells potentially via a number  of  different  mechanisms  (antibody  dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis).

Mabthera (Rituximab) was first approved in 1998 in the European Union (EU) and has since received regulatory approval in 102 countries. It is currently approved in the EU for the following indications:

- for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy
- for  the  treatment  of  previously  untreated  patients  with  stage  III-IV  follicular  lymphoma  in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy
- as  maintenance  therapy  for  patients  with  relapsed/refractory  follicular  lymphoma  responding  to induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without rituximab
- for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy
- in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of adult patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  or  intolerance  to  other  disease-modifying  antirheumatic drugs including one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies.

Since  the  marketing  authorization  was  granted  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  follicular lymphoma in combination with CVP chemotherapy in August 2004, data from a variety of recently published  randomized  clinical  trials  as  well  as  meta-analyses  and  retrospective  cohort  studies  have consistently  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  rituximab  in  combination  with  various  chemotherapy regimens other than CVP for initial treatment of this disease.

Follicular  lymphomas  account  for  20-25%  of  all  lymphomas. The disease  generally  manifests  with hypertrophy  of  peripheral  and  deep  lymph  nodes  and  splenomegaly,  together  with  bone  marrow infiltration.

Follicular lymphoma is characterized by an indolent course of disease. Treatment is usually associated with a high rate of initial response to various regimens, followed inevitably by relapse. Subsequent remissions  occur  but  at  a  progressively  lower  rate  and  usually  of  shorter  duration.  Prognosis  of patients  with  relapsed  disease  is  poor.  Even  though  remission  can  still  be  obtained  with  available salvage regimens, its duration is invariably shorter after each induction cycle. Median survival ranges between  6-10  years  and  the  majority  of  patients  eventually  die  from  their  disease.  Histological transformation  to  more  aggressive  non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma  (NHL)  with  poor  prognosis  has  been documented to occur in 20-80% of patients over time. Also, the likelihood of resistant lymphoma or occurrence  of  secondary  malignancies  such  as  myelodysplastic  syndrome/acute  myeloid  leukemia (MDS/AML) increases with time and with the number, choice and intensity of previous treatments.

A variety of different chemotherapy regimens are used for initial treatment and the choice of treatment is largely based on patient prognosis and physician preference. Generally accepted regimens include single-agent regimens (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine) or combination regimens with or without anthracyclines (e.g. CHOP or CVP).

In  August  2004,  marketing  authorization  was  granted  for  the  use  of  rituximab  in  combination  with CVP  chemotherapy  for  treatment  of  previously  untreated  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma.  The approval  was  based  on  the  results  of  study  M39021  which  demonstrated  a  large  and  clinically meaningful benefit for previously untreated patients with FL receiving rituximab in combination with CVP chemotherapy when compared to treatment with CVP alone. The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly improved with the addition of rituximab to CVP (81% vs. 57% for R-CVP and CVP, respectively [p&lt;0.0001]) with a large difference in terms of complete response (CR) rates (41% vs. 11% for  patients  in  the  R-CVP  and  CVP  arms,  respectively).  With  a  current  median  follow  up  of 53 months, median time to progression or death (TTP) was significantly increased from 14.7 months

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with CVP alone to 33.6 months with R-CVP, p&lt;0.0001. The estimated overall survival (OS) showed a strong clinical benefit in favor of the R-CVP arm, and the two-sided significance level dropped below 0.05 (p=0.029, log-rank test).

Due to the heterogeneity in the choice of first-line chemotherapy regimens for patients with FL, the use of rituximab as initial treatment in this setting was also evaluated in a number of trials using a variety  of  different  chemotherapy  regimens  for  combination.  Chemotherapies  evaluated  in  these studies  included  anthracycline-based  (CHOP,  CHVP-IFN,  MCP)  or  fludarabine-based  regimens (FCM, FND) depending on local standard practices. All of these trialshave consistently demonstrated a significant improvement of progression-free survival (PFS) or time to treatment failure (TTF) and OS when rituximab was added to chemotherapy in this setting, regardless of the type of chemotherapy regimen  chosen  for  combination  with  rituximab.  Moreover,  meta-analyses  evaluating  the  role  of rituximab in the treatment of FL as well as retrospective cohort comparisons in untreated patients with FL pooling data of rituximab in combination with a variety of chemotherapy regimens have confirmed the major clinical benefit provided by rituximab in the treatment of this disease.

Based  on  the  overall  strong  evidence  in  these  trials  of  a  large  and  meaningful  clinical  benefit  of rituximab  regardless  of  the  type  of  added  chemotherapy,  rituximab  in  combination  with  any chemotherapy has become the standard of care for first-line treatment of FL patients worldwide and has  been  widely  adopted  into  clinical  practice  for  the  management  of  these  patients.  This  is  also reflected  in  several  treatment  guidelines  worldwide  for  the  management  of  patients  with  FL, which recommend  the  usage  of  rituximab  for  initial  treatment  of  patients  with  FL  in  combination  with chemotherapy  without  restriction  to  a  specific  chemotherapy  regimen.  In  addition,  rituximab-based combination therapy is the standard of care for initial therapy in a number of ongoing clinical trials evaluating new treatment strategies (e.g. maintenance therapy) or new compounds for the treatment of FL patients.

However,  the  current  label  in  the  EU  for  rituximab  does  not  reflect  current  clinical  practice  as  it restricts rituximab usage in this setting to combination with CVP chemotherapy only.

This  application  is  based  primarily  on  published  data  (either  full  text  manuscripts  or  conference abstracts) from three key randomized studies conducted by European Cooperative Lymphoma Study Groups:

- The German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group trial (GLSG'00) comparing 6-8 cycles of frontline  therapy  with  rituximab  and  CHOP  (cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine, prednisone)  (R-CHOP)  with  CHOP  alone  in  previously  untreated  advanced-stage  follicular lymphoma patients
- The  German  OSHO-39  (East  German  Study  Group  Hematology  and  Oncology)  trial comparing  8  cycles  of  rituximab  in  combination  with  MCP  (mitoxantrone,  chlorambucil, prednisolone) chemotherapy (R-MCP) with MCP alone as first-line treatment for patients with low-grade lymphoma.
- The French  FL2000  study  conducted  by  the  Groupe  d'Etudes  des  Lymphomes  de  l'Adulte (GELA)  in  collaboration  with  the  Groupe  Ouest-Est  d'Étude  des  Leucémies  et  Autres Maladies du Sang  (GOELAMS)  evaluating  the  efficacy  of 6 cycles of rituximab in combination with CHVP-IFN  (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisone, interferonα ) for previously untreated patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma.

Study GLSG'00 and study FL2000 were conducted independently by national lymphoma study groups in  Germany  and  France,  respectively.  For  study  FL2000,  the  principal  investigator  provided confidential information on patient baseline demographics and safety data from the study manuscript that is currently in preparation. The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) has no access to the data from these two studies other than what is publicly available in the medical community in the format of full text publications and thus cannot provide any clinical study reports for these trials. Study OSHO39 was conducted by the East German Study Group Hematology and Oncology and was sponsored by Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Germany. For this trial, the primary reference is a recent full text publication of  the  study  results  in  the  Journal  of  Clinical  Oncology  2007.  This  reference  presents  the  longest

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

follow up data that is currently available for this study. A final study report for this trial is expected to be available at the end of 2008.

In addition, efficacy and/or safety results of publications from different meta-analyses, retrospective cohort comparisons as well as a number of phase II studies exploring rituximab in combination with other cytotoxic agents such as chlorambucil or purine-analogue based regimens are supplied to support the application.

The decision to submit this variation application was based on:

- Strong evidence from several large, randomized phase III trials and supporting evidence from meta-analyses, retrospective cohort studies and phase II studies demonstrating that the addition of rituximab to any chemotherapy regimen provides a clinically meaningful benefit to previously untreated patients with FL.
- The observation that all data consistently demonstrated an improvement in overall survival when rituximab was added to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone, regardless of chemotherapy regimen used for combination
- Follow-up periods in all studies presented in this dossier which were long enough to allow for clinically relevant and meaningful conclusions.
- Safety data showing that the safety profile overall of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy remains unchanged with no significant additional toxicity, regardless of the chemotherapy regimen combined with rituximab

Furthermore, section 4.2 was restructured in order to clarify posology and method of administration with regards to the numbers of chemotherapy cycles recommended for each chemotherapy combination option.

## 2. Clinical aspects

The German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group trial (GLSG'00) was performed as a prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter phase 3 trial. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the  Department  of  Medicine,  University  of  Munich,  Germany.  The  study  was  carried  out  in accordance with the modified Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave their written informed consent after having been informed about the purpose and investigational nature of the trial. Before initiation the  study  received  approval  by  the  responsible  ethics  committee.  Registration  in  a  trials  database, monitoring and institutional review are not mentioned in the publication.

The German OSHO-39 (East German Study Group Hematology and Oncology) trial was performed as a  prospective,  randomized, open-label multicenter phase 3 trial. The study complied with all of the requirements  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  its  current  amendments  and  was  conducted  in accordance  with  good  clinical  practice  guidelines.  All  patients  gave  written  informed  consent.  The protocol and accompanying materials were approved by an independent ethics committee and local ethics committees at each participating center. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under ID 00269113. Monitoring and institutional review are not mentioned in the publication.

The French FL2000 study conducted by the Groupe d'Etudes des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA) in collaboration  with  the  Groupe  Ouest-Est  d'Étude  des  Leucémies  et  Autres  Maladies  du  Sang (GOELAMS) was performed as a prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter phase 3 trial. The protocol was approved by the local or national ethics committees and the national regulatory agency according  to  the  French  and  Belgium  regulatory  laws.  Patients  had  to  give  their  written  informed consent  prior  to  be  randomized  in  the  study.  The  study  was  registered  on  the  National  Institute  of Health  website  (NCT00136552).  Monitoring  and  institutional  review  are  not  mentioned  in  the manuscript.

All three pivotal trials seem to have been conducted in accordance with the principles of GCP.

## 2. 1. Clinical efficacy

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

There are no dose-response studies, as the dose used in the studies for the present application is the dose approved for other indications in lymphomas. There is no need for new dose response studies for the present application.

The three main studies for the present application are summarized in Table 1.

In study GLSG'00, 630 previously untreated patients with advanced stage FL were randomized to a standard regimen of 6-8 cycles (2 cycles beyond CR) of CHOP chemotherapy or a combination of rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Responding patients underwent a second randomization to one of two different schedules; either interferonα maintenance therapy (patients ≥ 60 years) or interferonα maintenance  therapy  vs.  consolidation  treatment  with  high-dose  therapy  and  stem  cell  support (patients &lt;60 years). The primary endpoint for the comparison of CHOP alone vs. R-CHOP was TTF, defined as the interval  between  the  start  of  treatment  and  the  documentation  of  resistance  to  initial therapy,  progressive disease or death. The  trial was  stopped  early  after an interim analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

demonstrated  significant  superiority  for  the  primary  endpoint  TTF  in  favor  of  the  R-CHOP  arm (p&lt;0.001) with 428 patients evaluable for analysis of efficacy and safety.

In  study  OSHO-39,  358  patients  with  indolent  NHL  or  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (MCL)  were randomized  to  either  8  cycles  of  rituximab  plus  MCP-chemotherapy  (mitoxantrone,  chlorambucil, prednisolone) given every 4 weeks for a total of 8 cycles versus MCP alone. Responding patients with follicular histology were scheduled to continue on interferonα maintenance treatment until PD. The primary  efficacy  analysis  population  in  this  study  was  the  population  of  patients  with  follicular lymphoma (n=201). The primary endpoint was the remission rate, defined as the rate of complete (CR) and partial (PR) remissions after induction therapy. Secondary  efficacy parameters included progression-free  survival  (PFS;  interval  from  randomization  date  to  progression  of  disease  or  death from NHL), overall survival (OS; interval from randomization date to death from any cause), eventfree survival (EFS; interval from randomization date to treatment failure (defined as PD after 2 cycles and failure to achieve at least PR at cycle 6, disease progression, relapse or death from any cause), duration of response (DR; interval from first assessment of CR/PR to disease progression), and time to next  anti-lymphoma  treatment  (TTNT;  interval  from  randomization  date  to  the  time  when  new treatment was initiated).

Study FL2000 recruited a total of 359 patients with previously untreated FL. Patients were randomized to either 12 courses of CHVP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisolone) plus IFNα 2b given over a period of 18 months (CHVP-IFN) or 6 courses of CHVP and rituximab combined with IFNα 2b administered over 18 months (R-CHVP-IFN). The primary endpoint of the trial was EFS, defined  as  the  interval  between  start  of  therapy  and  disease  progression,  initiation  of  new  antilymphoma therapy or death due to any cause. A total of 358 patients were evaluable for efficacy.

The target population for recruitment into the studies included in this submission were patients with advanced stage (stage IIB-IV) follicular lymphoma (FL), with high tumor burden and symptomatic disease requiring therapy. The median age of patients enrolled in these three studies ranged between 54 and 61 years. Between 25% and 40% of patients had B-symptoms at study entry. More than 80% of the  enrolled  patients  had  intermediate  to  high  risk  disease  according  to  the  follicular  lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) and between 23% and 37% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In 60%-74% of patients bone marrow involvement by lymphoma was present. A small fraction of patients (6%-9%) had an ECOG score &gt; 1. Overall, the treatment groups in the three key randomized  studies  were  comparable  to  the  population  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  M39021 (rituximab in combination with CVP which has already been approved) and generally representative for the overall population of patients with advanced stage follicular NHL in need of therapy.

Within  the  individual  studies,  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  demographic parameters and baseline disease characteristics.

The key efficacy endpoints differed between the key studies as outlined in Table 2. For the definitions of time to event parameters, see also Table 3. Due to the different primary and secondary endpoints, a pooling of the data was not possible.

## Results

Overall, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone significantly improved the outcome of patients for all primary and secondary endpoints in all key studies:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Overall response (OR) rates and complete remission rates were significantly increased for patients who had received rituximab plus chemotherapy compared to those who had received chemotherapy alone (table 3). ORR with R-chemo were 96% (R-CHOP), 92% (R-MCP), 94% (RCHVP-I) and 81% (R-CVP) compared to ORRs with chemotherapy alone of 90% (CHOP), 75% (MCP), 85% (CHVP-I) and 57% (CVP). Complete response rates were up to quadrupled with the addition  of  rituximab  to  chemotherapy  (CR  rates  20-76%  with  R-chemo  vs.  17-49%  with chemotherapy alone).
- Time-to event parameters were significantly improved when rituximab was added to chemotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy  alone  with  a  risk  reduction  for  experiencing  disease progression or treatment failure of 50-60% across the trials.
- OS  rates  also  significantly  improved  in  all  key  trials  when  rituximab  was  combined  with chemotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy  alone  despite  a  limited  follow-up  period  (medians between 18-47 months).

These  results  are  in  line  with  previously  submitted  data  of  patients  with  stage  III-IV  FL  who  had received rituximab in combination with CVP first-line (study M39021).

## Clinical studies in special populations

Overall, the addition of rituximab to any chemotherapy regimen improved the clinical outcome in all subgroup populations analyzed [international prognostic index (IPI), FLIPI, age, quality of response to induction therapy].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In  study  GLSG'00,  the  beneficial  effects  of  R-CHOP  compared  to  CHOP  were  seen  in  all subgroups analyzed according to the IPI (low/low-intermediate vs high-intermediate/high risk) or age (&lt;60 years vs. &gt;= 60 years) for the primary endpoint of time to treatment failure. The risk of treatment failure was reduced by 60%-70% for all subgroups. In the elderly population, R-CHOP also  resulted  in  significantly  improved  PFS  (p&lt;0.0001)  and  OS  (p=0.039)  compared  to  CHOP treatment.
- Results from study OSHO-39 demonstrated that treatment with R-MCP significantly increased the 4-year PFS rate as well as prolonged the median time to disease progression or death in patients with intermediate (p=0.0016) as well as high risk (p=0.0011) disease according to the FLIPI score. Amongst patients with high risk disease, a significant improvement in overall survival was also seen amongst those treated with R-MCP compared with MCP (p=0.0096).
- In study FL2000, subgroup analysis were performed according to the FLIPI score and quality of response [CR/ complete response unconfirmed (CRu)] to induction therapy. The results demonstrated  a  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint,  event-free  survival  with  RCHVP-IFN compared with CHVP-IFN, for patients with low to intermediate risk (p = 0.0019) as well as for patients with high risk disease (p =0.0005). A significant benefit was also seen in the subgroup of patients who achieved a CR/CRu (p = 0.002).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

A Cochrane meta-analysis included a total of 1943 patients with indolent lymphoma (most commonly follicular  lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma) enrolled across seven controlled studies (including studies GLSG'00 and OSHO-39) which compared R-chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. Of the seven listed trials, five were in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV disease and two trials included patients with relapsed/refractory disease. The chemotherapy regimens used for combination with rituximab included CHOP, CNOP, CVP, FCM, and MCP.

In the pooled population of studies, the ORR was 72% (673 of 935 patients) with chemotherapy-alone compared with 87% (854 of 979 patients) in the R-chemotherapy group. The relative risk for response with  R-chemotherapy  compared  with  chemotherapy-alone  was  1.21  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI): 1.16  to  1.27).    Treatment  with  R-chemotherapy  was  associated  with  significantly  more  patients achieving  a  complete  response  (relative  risk  2.03,  95%  CI  1.71  to  2.40).  Subgroup  analyses  by histology showed higher ORR and CR rates in the R-chemo group compared to the chemo-group for both FL and MCL patients.

Treatment with R-chemotherapy led to significantly superior disease control (defined as progression, relapse  or  death)  compared  with  chemotherapy  alone  (HR:  0.62;  95%  0.55  to  0.71).  These  finding remained  significant  when  the  analysis  was  conducted  according  to  the  subgroup  of  patients  with follicular lymphoma and MCL.

Overall survival data was available on all 1943 patients included in the meta-analysis. The hazard ratio for  death  from  any  cause  was  0.65  (95%  CI:  0.54-0.78)  indicating  a  statistically  significant  better overall  survival  in  the  R-chemotherapy  groups  compared  with  the  chemotherapy  alone  groups. Amongst the 1480 patients with follicular lymphoma, treatment with R-chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy-alone reduced the risk of death by 37% (HR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79). Assuming a 2year  overall  survival  rate  of  90%  for  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma,  it  was  estimated  that approximately 28 patients had to be treated with R-chemotherapy to prevent one additional death in 2 years.

The meta-analysis contains 7 randomized trials, 2 of the trials are the first 2 trials submitted by the MAH for the present application, 1 of the trials is the pivotal trial for the approved indication for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with CVP chemotherapy, 2 of the trials are trials of patients relapsing after previous therapy, 1 of the trials is for patients with mantle cell lymphoma only, and 1 of the trials does not specify the type of indolent lymphomas included in the trial. Hence, the meta-analysis does not in fact contribute significant new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

information with regard to efficacy for the present application. The results of the meta-analysis are, as expected, in accordance with the results of the three pivotal trials.

## Supportive studies

- In a retrospective cohort study, five consecutive cohorts involving 580 patients with stage IV FL treated  at  the  M.D.  Anderson  Cancer  Center  between  1972  and  2002  were  analyzed  for  OS, failure-free survival and survival after first relapse in order to assess the impact of new treatment strategies  on  the  response  of  FL  patients  over  time.  Treatment  regimens  included  were  CHOPBleomycin  (CHOP-Bleo),  CHOP-Bleo  followed  by  interferonα ,  a  rotation  of  three  regimens followed by interferonα (alternating triple therapy -ATT); fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone followed by interferonα (FND) and FND plus delayed or concurrent rituximab followed by interferonα (R-FND). Median follow-up times of survivors for the five cohorts were 23.7 years, 17.5 years, 12 years, 8.2 years, and 3.3 years respectively. The results showed a steady increase  in  5-year  OS  rates  over  time  from  64%  with  CHOP-Bleo  to  95%  with  R-FND (p&lt;0.0001). Notable increments in OS occurred with the incorporation of interferonα in 1982 and rituximab  in  1997  (p&lt;0.05).  Like  the  data  on  OS,  the  failure-free  survival  (FFS)  showed  a stepwise improvement with the more recent studies from a median FFS of 2.8 years with CHOPBleo to the median not being reached with R-FND. These observations held true after controlling for differences in prognostic factors among the cohorts.
- The GLSG analyzed two consecutive study generations covering a ten year period for remission rates, time to treatment failure (TTF) and OS in order to identify treatment modalities leading to improvements  in  overall  survival  for  patients  with  advanced  stage  follicular  lymphoma.  The analysis was adjusted for risk factors according to the FLIPI and the type of induction regimen (including  rituximab  or  not).  A  total  of  1332  patients  with  complete  data  sets  were  collected between 1996 and 2005. Therapies included CHOP and MCP in GLSG Study'96 and CHOP and R-CHOP  in  GLSG  Study'00.  CHOP  was  superior  to  MCP  in  terms  of  OR  rates,  but  did  not improve TTF or OS compared to MCP. Although the entry criteria and the distribution of risk factors  were  nearly  identical  in  both  study  generations,  patients  in  study  GLSG'00  had  a significantly higher OR rate (94% vs. 88%, odds ratio 0.47; p=0.0002), a longer TTF (median 48 months vs. 32 months, relative risk 0.66; p&lt;0.0001) and a longer OS (4-year OS 89% vs. 78%, relative  risk  0.42;  p&lt;0.0001)  when  compared  to  patients  in  study  GLSG'96.  Multiple  Coxregression analysis identified rituximab as being the determinant parameter for the differences in ORR (adjusted odds ratio 0.45, p&lt;0.0001), TTF (adjusted relative risk 0.39, p&lt;0.0001) and OS (adjusted relative risk 0.44, p=0.0064). Hence, rituximab was identified as the essential treatment modality that underlies the improvement in short and long term outcome of patients with advanced stage FL.
- In a retrospective cohort study from the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL), 438 patients with advanced stage, histologically confirmed diagnosis of follicular lymphoma who met the defined eligibility criteria were included in the analysis. Of these, 307 previously untreated patients were treated  with  one  of  the  following  regimens:  ProMECE-CytaBOM  (36  patients,  group  1), bleomycin,  epidoxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  vincristine,  prednisone  (BACOP;  66  patients, group  2),  BACOP/FND  (144  patients,  group  3)  or  BACOP/F  in  combination  with  rituximab (61 patients,  group  4).  One  hundred  and  thirty-one  patients  with  recurring  disease  were  treated with CHOP or FC (52 patients, group 5), or with CHOP or FC in combination with rituximab (79 patients, group 6).

The median FFS improved stepwise with evolving treatments from group 1 to group 4 which was the group of patients receiving treatment with rituximab. This significant improvement over time was confirmed by a Cox regression analysis adjusted for FLIPI scores and radiotherapy. Of note, improvements in FFS were particularly evident in cohort 4 patients treated with rituximab. The relative  risk  reduction  for  FFS  with  the  rituximab-chemotherapy  regimen  in  cohort  4  compared with cohort 1 was 76% (95% CI: 49% to 89%) and compared with cohort 3 was 51%. Amongst treatment-naïve patients, the 4-yr overall survival was 76%, 87%, 82% and 97% in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, although the overall p-value (for the comparison of survival curves between the  studies)  was  not  significant.    However,  after  adjusting  for  the  FLIPI  score  in  the  Cox

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regression model, there was a significant reduction in the hazard ratio from group 1 to 4. Of note, the  relative  risk  reduction  for  mortality  with  the  rituximab-chemotherapy  regimen  in  group  4 compared with group 1 was 91% (95% CI: 30% to 98%) and 71% compared to group 3.

The  impact  of  rituximab  used  as  part  of  salvage  therapy  was  investigated  by  an  analysis  of survival  after  recurrence  (SAR)  in  131  relapsed  patients.  The  5-year  estimate  of  SAR  was significantly longer for patients who received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy (group 6) compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone at the time of relapse (group 5) (74% versus  57%,  p=0.032).  This  statistically  significant  difference  in  SAR  was  maintained  after  the analysis was adjusted for age and duration of the previous remission (p=0.014).

The  retrospective  cohort  analyzes  present  data  from  patients  treated  at  the  M.D.  Anderson  Cancer Center  over  a  25-year  period,  by  the  German  Low  Grade  Lymphoma  Study  Group  over  a  10-year period,  and  by  the  Gruppo  Italiano  Studio  Linfomi  over  a  16-year  period.  None  of  these  analyzes contain  patients  randomized  in  trials  relevant  to  the  present  application.  Comparisons  of  treatments with  and  without  Rituximab  are  retrospective  and  bias  cannot  be  excluded.  The  results  of  these analyzes are in accordance with the findings of the three randomized trials. They do not, however, by themselves contribute significantly with regard to efficacy for the present application.

Data from five uncontrolled phase II studies provide additional supportive evidence of the efficacy of rituximab when added to various chemotherapy regimens (single agent or combinations). Although the majority of studies were in the first-line setting, the protocols of two studies also allowed recruitment of relapsed patients (table 1).

The ORR across the studies was very high and in the range 89% to 100% with a complete response rate of between 55% and 96%. The median duration of follow-up ranged between 2.8 and 9 years. The most impressive results were seen in the study by Czuczman et al using the R-CHOP regimen; with a median follow-up of 9 years, the median time to progression and the median duration of response were nearly 7 years.

## 2. 2. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The overall evaluation of the safety of rituximab in combination with any chemotherapy (R-Chemo) is mainly derived from safety information available from three key randomized studies including a total of  987  patients.  Additional  evidence  about  the  safety  profile  of  rituximab  in  combination  with different  chemotherapy  regimens  comes  from  the  Cochrane  meta-analysis  and  multiple  phase  II studies. For the purpose of the discussion, safety data of the pivotal study M39021 (CVP or R-CVP in patients  with  advanced  stage  follicular  lymphoma)  are  be  presented  alongside  safety  results  of  the three key randomized studies.

In study OSHO-39, all eight cycles of treatment were administered to 88% of patients in the R-MCP arm and to 67% of patients in the MCP arm. This difference in exposure was mainly accounted for by more patients withdrawing from the MCP than from the R-MCP arm due to treatment failure during therapy: failures due to progressive disease (PD) after 2 cycles occurred in 3 (R-MCP) and 10 (MCP) patients  and  failure  to  achieve  at  least  PR  after  6  cycles  occurred  in  7  (R-MCP)  and  22  (MCP) patients.  Mean  doses  of  study  drug  administered  were  as  follows:  rituximab,  660 -680  mg/cycle; mitoxantrone, 24 -28 mg/cycle; chlorambucil, 68 -81 mg/cycle and prednisolone, 226 -231 mg/cycle. Dose  intensity of the chemotherapy  did  not differ between  treatment arms. Interferon-alpha maintenance treatment (3 x 4.5 million units per week until disease progression) was initiated in 97% and 92% of responding patients in the R-MCP group and the MCP group, respectively. To date, the median  duration  of  interferon  maintenance  treatment  is  15.5  months  in  the  R-MCP  group  and  9.5 months in the MCP group with the difference being due to earlier disease progression in the MCP group.

In study FL2000, 94% of patients in the CHVP-IFN arm and 95% of patients in the R-CHVP-IFN arm received the initial six cycles of treatment. Of those patients who did not progress during therapy, 153 (98%) and 161 (98%) patients on CHVP-IFN and R-CHVP-IFN, respectively, completed the planned chemotherapy induction courses during the first 6 months. In the CHVP-IFN arm, 116 (89%) of the patients not experiencing disease progression received the 6 planned bi-monthly cycles of chemotherapy  consolidation  following  induction  treatment.  In  total,  237  (66%)  patients  received interferon-alpha treatment according to the protocol: dose modifications occurred in 45 patients and short (less than 4 weeks) interruptions occurred in 55 patients without significant differences between the two study arms. Interferon-alpha treatment was stopped due to disease progression in 50 patients (CHVP-IFN arm 31 cases; R-CHVP-IFN arm 19 cases). Dose interruptions for more than one month or stopping of interferon-alpha treatment were reported in 47 patients (26%) in the CHVP-IFN arm and 41 patients (23 %) in the R-CHVP-IFN arm.

## Adverse events

Overall, the safety profile of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy (R-Chemo) as described in the key studies in this submission is consistent with the safety profile of rituximab in combination with CHOP or CVP chemotherapy as reported  in  studies  M39021  (R-CVP,  untreated  FL),  M39022  (RCHOP, relapsed/refractory FL), BO16368 (R-CHOP in elderly patients with DLBCL) and M39045 (R-Chemo  in  younger  patients  with  DLBCL).  An  increase  in  all  grade  AEs  was  observed  in  the rituximab containing arms of all key studies compared to chemotherapy alone, which was mainly due to  a  higher  incidence of leukopenia and/or neutropenia, infection and allergy. Importantly, although the  incidence  of  infections  of  all  grades  was  usually  slightly  increased  with  rituximab  added  to chemotherapy,  none  of  the  studies  reported  a  significant  increase  in  the  incidence  of  grade  3/4 infections. There were no new or unexpected toxicities observed.

The most common ( ≥ 10% in at least one treatment group) reported AEs of any grade reported in studies GLSG'00 and OSHO-39 included blood and bone marrow disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, skin toxicities, neurological disorders, infections, fever bone pain and other.

The higher incidence of AEs of all grades in the rituximab containing arms was mainly due to a higher incidence of blood and bone marrow disorders (leukopenia and/or neutropenia) and allergy (including rash) as well as more gastrointestinal disorders in study OSHO-39. Other AEs that were observed at a

higher frequency ( ≥ 2% difference in all grade AEs in the rituximab containing arms) in at least one of the studies included infections, fever, cardiac arrhythmia, neurological disorders and bone pain.

The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included blood and bone marrow disorders, and alopecia. A higher incidence of grade 3/4 AEs in the rituximab containing arms was observed for blood and bone marrow disorders in studies GLSG'00 and OSHO-39. Other grade 3/4 AEs that were observed at a higher frequency ( ≥ 2% difference in grade 3/4 AEs in the rituximab containing arms) in at least one of the studies included alopecia, infection, cardiac disorders and bone pain.

Of note, in study GLSG'00 there was a slight increase in grade 3/4 cardiac events (cardiac dysfunction and  cardiac  arrhythmia)  in  the  rituximab  containing  arm  (1%  of  patients  on  CHOP  versus  5%  of patients  on  R-CHOP  with  a  cardiac  event).  However,  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  grade  3/4 cardiac events was observed in study FL2000.

Adverse events related to the infusion of rituximab occurred in 7% of courses during the first infusion in one particular key study (GLSG'00); early cessation of rituximab therapy was required in 2 patients. The overall safety profile of rituximab combined with different chemotherapy regimen as described in the key studies is similar to the safety profile observed in the pivotal study M39021 comparing CVP with R-CVP. In this study, an increase in all grade and grade 3/4 AEs was observed in the R-CVP arm. In most of the cases, AEs with a higher incidence in the R-CVP group were those already recognized as belonging to the safety profile of rituximab, mostly typical of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). In addition, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher for patients in the R-CVP arm than for patients on CVP treatment (24% versus 14%). However, this was not associated with an increased rate of grade 3/4 infections.

## Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders

As  observed  in  previous  studies  (M39021,  table  5),  a  higher  frequency  of  leukopenia  and/or granulocytopenia of all grades and grades 3/4 was observed after treatment with R-Chemo in studies GLSG'00, and OSHO-39. In contrast to these two studies, grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred at a higher incidence in the chemotherapy alone arm (62% with CHVP-IFN vs 59% with R-CHVP-IFN) in study FL2000. This difference is due to the different number of treatment cycles for the CHVP regimen in the study arms: in the chemotherapy alone arm, 12 cycles of CHVP given over a period of 12 months were administered in combination with interferonα , whereas in the rituximab-containing arm only 6 cycles of CHVP were given over a period of 6 months in combination with rituximab and interferonα .

Table 5 Overview of Grade 3 and 4 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders in Studies GLSG'00, OSHO-39, FL2000 and M39021

|                       | GLSG'00      | GLSG'00        | OSHO-39    | OSHO-39       | FL2000            | FL2000              | M39021      | M39021        |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|

n.r., not reported

Overall,  grade  3/4  granulocytopenia  was  more  frequently  encountered  after  rituximab  treatment  in combination  with  CHOP  (63%)  than  after  treatment  in  combination  with  CVP  (24%)  or  CHVP-I (59%). However, clinically relevant infections (grade 3/4) were not significantly different between the rituximab-containing and the chemotherapy alone arms in any of the studies described.

## Infections and Infestations

Overall,  between  36%  and  49%  of  patients  in  studies  GLSG'00  and  OSHO-39  experienced  an infection.  The  incidence  of  infections  of  all  grade  was  slightly  higher  in  the  rituximab-containing treatment arm: 36% with CHOP vs. 38% with R-CHOP in study GLSG'00, 43% with MCP vs. 49%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with R-MCP in study OSHO-39. For study FL2000, no rates for patients experiencing an infection of any grade were provided.

Importantly,  although  the  incidence  of  all  grades  infection  was  usually  higher  in  the  rituximabcontaining treatment arms of the studies conducted, the incidence of grade 3/4 infections was always comparable  between  R-chemo  and  chemotherapy  alone:  7%  after  CHOP  vs.  5%  after  R-CHOP (GLSG'00), 8% after MCP vs. 7% after R-MCP (OSHO-39) and 0% after CHVP-I vs 2% after RCHVP-I.

These rates of all grade and grade 3/4 infections reported in the key studies above are in line with previously  reported  incidences  of  infections  in  patients  with  FL  or  DLBCL  from  other  randomized trials.

## Safety Results of the Cochrane Meta-analysis

Safety data is available from the meta-analysis performed by the Cochrane Hematological Malignancies  Group.  In  summary,  the  analysis  confirmed  the  observations  from  the  three  key randomized  studies:  patients  treated  with  R-Chemo  experienced  significantly  more  leukopenia  and fever than patients with chemotherapy alone, but there were no significant differences in the incidence of infections or thrombocytopenia between the groups.

## Post Marketing Surveillance

Post-marketing surveillance data collected in the global rituximab safety database with a data cut-off of  April  30,  2007  are  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  in  the  three  key  studies  and  the  supportive safety information from the meta-analysis.

In  the  global  database  with  over  10,000  AEs  reported,  the  most  frequently  reported  events  were infection and infestation (15%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (14%), general disorders and administration site conditions (11%) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (10%). Where data  on  chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab is available, the most frequently reported AEs  in  any  rituximab-chemotherapy  combination  were  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders, infections and infestations, respiratory disorders, general disorders and gastrointestinal disorders, apart from R-CVP where the order is slightly different: respiratory, general, blood and lymphatic, infections and infestations, investigations and gastrointestinal disorders.

The overall conclusion from post-marketing experience is that the safety profile and the benefit/risk assessment  for  rituximab  in  combination  with  any  chemotherapy  regimen  remain  favorable  for patients with advanced stage (stage III-IV) FL.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

In the randomized studies with information on deaths, a higher number of death cases were reported for the chemotherapy alone arms compared to the R-Chemo arms. A total of 23 deaths (17 CHOP and 6 R-CHOP) and 40 deaths (25 MCP and 15 R-MCP) occurred in study GLSG'00 and study OSHO-39, respectively.  This  increase  in  death  cases  in  the  chemotherapy  arms  was  predominantly  due  to progression of disease (9 versus 1 patient in study GLSG'00 and 17 versus 7 patients in study OSHO39). Eight and 5 patients (on CHOP and R-CHOP, respectively) in study GLSG'00 and 8 patients in each treatment arm in study OSHO-39 died due to lymphoma-unrelated causes. In study FL2000, a total of 45 patients had died at the time of the analysis at 42 months (29 on CHVP-IFN and 16 on RCHVP-IFN). No information was available on the cause of death from this study. These data do not indicate any increase in deaths due to toxicity of rituximab.

## Laboratory findings

No  information  on  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  was  available  from  the  studies  presented  in  this application. Extensive data are available from previous applications for the now approved indications, and from post-marketing data.

## Safety in special populations

Except for results on an elderly population in study GLSG'00, no safety information was available on special groups and situations from the studies presented in this application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study GLSG'00, no new, unexpected safety signals were detected in the elderly population ( ≥ 60 years of age, n=221). In line with the analysis on the full safety population, the most common AEs of any  grade  included  blood  and  bone  marrow  disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  skin  toxicities, neurological disorders, cardiac disorders, infections and fever. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in  intensity  except  for  alopecia,  leukopenia  and  neutropenia,  which  were  mainly  of  grade  3/4  in intensity.

## Immunological events

No specific information on immunological events is presented, except for the listed numbers of blood and lymphatic system disorders and immune system disorders.

## Discontinuation due to AES

In  the  GLSG'00  trial  early  discontinuation  of  rituximab  was  required  in  2  patients.  No  early discontinuations were reported in the OSHO-39 trial and the FL2000.

## 3. Overall Discussion and Benefit- Risk assessment

A number of clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of rituximab in combination with various different chemotherapy  regimens.  The  results  from  the  three  key  randomized  trials,  plus  the  pivotal  study M39021,  using  rituximab  in  combination  with  either  CVP,  CHOP,  CHVP  or  MCP  as  the chemotherapy backbone consistently demonstrated significant superiority in terms of PFS and/or EFS. More importantly, all studies also showed a significant improvement in terms of overall survival for any of the four chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab when compared to chemotherapy alone.

These  findings  in  randomized  clinical  trials  were  further  confirmed  in  subsequent  meta-analyses incorporating key studies including the 4 randomized trials mentioned, in retrospective cohort studies and in other studies evaluating fludarabine-based regimens in combination with rituximab. In addition, a  number  of  phase  II  studies  where  longer  follow-up  was  available  suggested  that  combining rituximab with regimens such as fludarabine, CHOP or chlorambucil was effective and induced longlasting responses.

In conclusion, the published efficacy results from different clinical trials strongly support the use of rituximab  in  combination  with  various  chemotherapy  regimens  without  restriction  to  the  CVP regimen.

The  overall  safety  profile  of  rituximab  in  combination  with  different  chemotherapy  regimens  as presented in this Clinical Overview is similar to that observed in previous clinical experience. Overall, adding rituximab to different  chemotherapy  regimens  increases  the  incidence  of  neutropenia  and/or leucopenia,  allergy  or  infusion-related  reactions  as  well  as  infections.  An  increase  in  grade  3/4 neutropenia usually did not translate into an increase in grade 3/4 infection. No significant new safety concerns  have  been  observed  in  the  three  key  studies  and  the  Cochrane  meta-analysis,  in  which  a number of different concomitant chemotherapy regimens have been used. In summary, the addition of rituximab  to  various  different  chemotherapy  regimens  did  not  significantly  increase  the  toxicity  of chemotherapy.

The  data  from  all  the  studies  presented  in  this  dossier  consistently  demonstrate  that  rituximab significantly  improves  the  outcome  of  patients  with  advanced  stage  FL  when  given  first-line  in addition  to  any  chemotherapy  regimen.  Specifically,  the  addition  of  rituximab  to  chemotherapy significantly  improves  response  rates  and  long-term  outcomes  for  patients  with  advanced  stage  FL receiving:

- six to eight cycles of R-CHOP. These beneficial effects were seen in all patient subgroups analyzed according to disease risk (FLIPI) or age (GLSL'00).
- eight cycles of R-MCP (study OSHO-39).
- six cycles of R-CHVP-I (study FL2000).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Additional  evidence  from  meta-analyses,  retrospective  cohort  studies  and  a  number  of  phase  II trials supports a consistent clinical benefit including improved overall survival when rituximab is added to any chemotherapy regimen.
- -All these results are in line with the improved clinical outcome seen in patients who received eight cycles of CVP in combination with rituximab in the pivotal study M39021.
- -Across all studies, no new safety signals were observed and rituximab did not add to the toxicity of chemotherapy.

All studies consistently demonstrated significant superiority in terms of PFS and/or EFS for combined immunochemotherapy. The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk for disease progression or treatment failure by 40-60% across the trials. More importantly, all studies have also shown a significant improvement in overall survival for all of the four chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab when compared to chemotherapy alone. Overall survival is considered the most important endpoint in clinical trials evaluating follicular lymphoma and is a robust and unbiased endpoint, which is not affected by differences in study design such as schedule and methodology of assessment of tumor response. In those trials where hazard ratios for OS were available, the risk of death  was  reduced  by  40-50%  when  patients  were  treated  with  immunochemotherapy  compared  to chemotherapy alone.

A higher incidence of infusion-related reactions/allergy, blood and bone marrow disorders (neutropenia) and infections have been described in association with rituximab treatment in previous studies. Increases in all grade and grade 3/4 leukopenia/neutropenia and infections were also observed in the key studies supplied in this application. These toxicites were manageable and did not change the risk-benefit  assessment  of  previous  studies.  No  new  or  unexpected  toxicities  were  reported  in  the submitted  three  key  randomized  studies.  In  summary,  the  overall  safety  profile  of  rituximab  in combination  with  any  chemotherapy  reported  in  the  key  studies  supporting  this  application  is consistent with the safety profile as previously described in other trials.

Since the indication is an enlargement of the existing one, the submission of a Risk Management Plan was not considered necessary.

In conclusion, the data from the key publications in this submission, along with data from supportive published studies, provide enough evidence justifying the use of rituximab in combination with any chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma.

The overall Benefit/Risk of rituximab is positive if administered in combination with chemotherapy in combination treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma.
