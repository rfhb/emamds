| II/0131 | Update of sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy and pharmacokinetic information based on final results from study ECU-MG-303; this is a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of eculizumab in pediatric patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce a sentence regarding polysorbate in line with QRD template and minor changes to the PI. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 19/12/2024 | SmPC and PL | SmPC new text Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis The text below is added in the end of the section: […]. Another 2 patients experienced clinical deteriorations (MG crisis) during the Extension Period requiring rescue therapy (PE and IVIg for clinical deterioration in one case and IVIg and 2 supplemental treatments of eculizumab in the second case). During the entire study period in paediatric patients with refractory gMG (study ECU-MG-303), 4 out of 11 patients (36.4%) decreased their daily dose of IST or anticholinesterase therapy due to improved MG symptoms. An additional patient (9.1%) decreased and subsequently increased their daily dose during the Extension Period due to improved and worsened MG symptoms respectively and 1 patient started a new corticosteroid treatment due to worsened MG symptoms.

Only two patients completed the Extension Period. Eight participants discontinued the study during the Extension Period including 4 participants transitioned to either commercially available Soliris or Ultomiris or transferred to another ongoing Ultomiris paediatric study. Patients consistently maintained the response through the study, which was of similar magnitude to that reported to during the initial treatment period.

| II/0071/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Grouped application including three type II variations: Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with clinical information for the paediatric and adult populations based on the final CSR for Study C10-003. Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with clinical information for the paediatric and adult populations based on the final CSR for Study C10-004. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC with further information regarding 'treatment discontinuation for aHUS' based on the interim report for the ongoing long-term study C11-003 (for patients included in the five completed clinical studies C08-002 A/B, C08- 003 A/B, C09-001r, C10-003 and C10-004). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 26/02/2015 | 30/03/2015 | SmPC and PL | Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications have been observed as early as 4 weeks and up to 127 weeks following discontinuation of Soliris treatment in some patients. Discontinuation of treatment should only be considered if medically justified. In aHUS clinical studies, 61 patients (21 paediatric patients) discontinued Soliris treatment with a median follow-up period of 24 weeks. Fifteen severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications in 12 patients were observed following treatment discontinuation, and 2 severe TMA complications occurred in an additional 2 patients that received a reduced dosing regimen of Soliris outside of the approved dosing regimen. Severe TMA complications occurred in patients regardless of whether they had an identified genetic mutation, high risk polymorphism or auto-antibody. Additional serious medical complications occurred in these patients including severe worsening of kidney function, disease-related hospitalization and progression to end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Despite Soliris re-initiation following discontinuation, progression to end stage renal disease occurred in one patient. If aHUS patients discontinue treatment with Soliris, they should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications. |

Adult population: Longer term treatment with Soliris (median 52 weeks ranging from 15 to 126 weeks) was associated with an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in adult patients with aHUS. When Soliris treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, three additional patients (63% of patients in total) achieved Complete TMA response and four additional patients (98% of patients in total) achieved hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 25 of 41 patients (61%) achieved eGFR improvement of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. Paediatric population: Longer term treatment with Soliris (median 55 weeks ranging from 1day to 107 weeks) was associated with an increased rate of clinically meaningful improvements in pediatric and adolescent patients with aHUS. When Soliris treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, one additional patient (68% of patients in total) achieved Complete TMA Response and two additional patients (91% of patients in total) achieved hematologic normalization. At the last evaluation, 19 of 22 patients (86%) achieved eGFR improvement of ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. No   |

The study C10-003 was an open- label, non-randomised, single-arm, multi-centre clinical trial of eculizumab in paediatric patients (one month up to 18 years) with aHUS. A total of 22 paediatric patients were treated with eculizumab in this study. The study C10-004 was an open-label, non-randomised, single-arm, multi- centre clinical trial of eculizumab in patients with aHUS that were at least 18 years of age or older. A total of 44 patients signed informed consent and 41 patients were treated in this study. In addition, long-term data from Studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B supporting the sustainability of response and the long-term clinical benefit of eculizumab therapy have been submitted. The SmPC has been updated to reflect these new safety and efficacy data. The section 4 of the Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. |

Results showed that none of the 74 patients tested positive for immune response to eculizumab following treatment for at least 6 years. The safety profile was in line with information already reflected in SmPC. |

| II/0025 | This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include information regarding the risk of meningococcal infections as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of PSUR 5 and revision of section 4.8 to include post-marketing experience. In addition, the PL has been revised to align the safety information with the SmPC. Furthermore, the PL is brought in line with the latest version of the QRD template (version 7.3.1), the version number of the DDPS was deleted and the version number of the RMP was updated in Annex II, and the list of the local representatives in the PL is amended. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | 17/02/2011 | 24/03/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Cumulatively 12 cases of meningococcal infections have been received in the Alexion Pharmacovigilance post- marketing safety database. The respective statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC has therefore been updated. In addition, following a review of the post-marketing safety database, an update of the ADRs listed in section 4.8 was considered necessary. Finally, the PL has been updated to align the safety information with the SmPC. |

Further, the MAH has included a table in section 4.8 with all adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials instead of the current table which includes adverse drug events. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The MAH has also made minor editorial changes to the annexes to put them in line with the latest QRD template and updated the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor changes to the wording of the 'conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product' in annex II for increased clarity, as agreed with CHMP following the assessment of FUM 022. As a consequence, Annex IV has been updated accordingly. |
