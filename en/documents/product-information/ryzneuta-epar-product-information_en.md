*Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Fc fusion protein derived from mammalian cell culture.

The potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to the potency of another protein (pegylated or non-pegylated) of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1.

## Excipient with known effect

Each prefilled syringe contains 50 mg sorbitol (E420).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.

Clear, colourless solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indication

Ryzneuta is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Ryzneuta therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or haematology.

## Posology

One 20 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Ryzneuta is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

## Special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

No dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Ryzneuta in children have not yet been established and no data are available.

## Method of administration

Ryzneuta is for subcutaneous use. It is provided in a pre-filled syringe for manual administration.

The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen, buttock or upper arm.

For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 .

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

## Malignant cell growth

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro .

The safety and efficacy of efbemalenograstim alfa have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, or acute myeloid leukaemia. Therefore, it should not be used in such patients.

The safety and efficacy of efbemalenograstim alfa have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose chemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens.

## Pulmonary adverse events

Pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF administration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk (see section 4.8).

The onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil count may be preliminary signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances, efbemalenograstim alfa should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment should be administered (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Glomerulonephritis

Glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving G-CSF (e.g. filgrastim and pegfilgrastim). Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of G-CSF. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended.

## Capillary leak syndrome

Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after G-CSF administration and is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).

## Splenomegaly and splenic rupture

Generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly have been reported after administration of efbemalenograstim alfa. Cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal cases, have been reported following administration of G-CSF (see section 4.8). Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain.

## Thrombocytopenia and anaemia

Treatment with efbemalenograstim alfa alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.

## Sickle cell anaemia

Sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of G-CSF in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing efbemalenograstim alfa in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, clinical parameters and laboratory status should be monitored appropriately and attentively by the physician for the possible association of this medicinal product with splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis.

## Leukocytosis

White blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 × 10 9 /L or greater have been observed in patients receiving G-CSF. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis have been reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, being typically seen 24 to 48 hours after administration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicinal product. Consistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 × 10 9 /L after the expected nadir, this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately.

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity, including serious allergic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in patients treated with G-CSF. Efbemalenograstim alfa should be permanently discontinued in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity. Efbemalenograstim alfa should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to efbemalenograstim alfa. Caution should be exercised if using efbemalenograstim alfa in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to other G-CSF products as the risk of cross-reactivity cannot be excluded. In such circumstances, efbemalenograstim alfa should be administered at the discretion of the physician with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the appropriate assessment of risks and benefits. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days.

## Stevens-Johnson syndrome

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in association with G-CSF treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of efbemalenograstim alfa, treatment with efbemalenograstim alfa must not be restarted in this patient at any time.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of antibodies against efbemalenograstim alfa is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all biologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.

## Aortitis

Aortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The symptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers (e.g. c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF (see also section 4.8).

## Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in breast and lung cancer patients

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been observed following the use of some G-CSF (e.g. pegfilgrastim) in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer (see section 4.8). Patients with breast and lung cancer should be monitored for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML.

## Other warnings

The safety and efficacy of Ryzneuta for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or healthy donors has not been adequately evaluated.

Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.

## Sorbitol

This medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 20 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Rubber - latex

The needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (latex), which may cause allergic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy , efbemalenograstim alfa should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and at least 14 days before the next dose of chemotherapy. Concomitant use of Ryzneuta with chemotherapy (i.e. administration on the same day) has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.

Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically investigated in clinical trials.

The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.

The safety and efficacy of Ryzneuta have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression, e.g. nitrosoureas.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of efbemalenograstim alfa in pregnant women. Although studies in animals have not shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3), Ryzneuta is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

There is insufficient information on the excretion of efbemalenograstim alfa in human milk; a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Ryzneuta therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

Efbemalenograstim alfa did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative weekly doses approximately 2.2 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body surface area) (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ryzneuta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [ ≥ 1/10]). Back pain, arthralgia and pain in extremity were reported commonly ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10). Musculoskeletal pain was generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics.

Serious angioedema occurred on subsequent treatment with efbemalenograstim alfa (uncommon [ ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100]).

Splenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. Splenic rupture, including some fatal cases, has been reported following administration of G-CSF (see section 4.4)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Uncommon pulmonary adverse reactions such as pulmonary oedema occurred on treatment with efbemalenograstim alfa. Other pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported following administration of G-CSF. Cases of respiratory failure or ARDS have been reported following administration of G-CSF, which may be fatal (see section 4.4).

Isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of G-CSF in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease (see section 4.4).

Capillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration of G-CSFs; see section 4.4 and section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of efbemalenograstim alfa has been evaluated based on the results from clinical trials.. Adverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and into frequency groups using the following convention : very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriouness.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based upon 488 patients receiving Ryzneuta in four clinical trials.

1 See section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below.

2 Includes multiple adverse reaction terms.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, asthenia, fatigue, pyrexia, vertigo and headaches were commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One case of serious urticaria was reported after efbemalenograstim alfa treatment.

White blood cell count increased was commonly reported after efbemalenograstim alfa treatment. Leukocytosis (white blood cell counts ˃ 100 × 10 9 /L) have been reported following the administration of G-CSF; (see section 4.4).

Increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been commonly observed in patients after receiving efbemalenograstim alfa following cytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline.

Certain adverse reactions have not yet been observed in efbemalenograstim alfa clinical studies, but are generally accepted as being attributable to G-CSF and derivatives:

An increased risk of MDS/AML has been observed in an epidemiological study following the use of some G-CSF in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer (see section 4.4).

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after G-CSF administration (see section 4.4).

Cases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported after G-CSF administration and is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Capillary leak syndrome generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant disease, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4).

Aortitis may occur following the administration of G-CSF (see section 4.4).

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) may occur following the administration of G-CSF (see section 4.4).

Glomerulonephritis may occur following administration of G-CSF (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

A single subject administered 40 mg efbemalenograstim alfa during a chemotherapy cycle (20 mg injections on consecutive days) reported adverse events that were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of efbemalenograstim alfa.

## 5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors; ATC Code: L03AA18

## Mechanism of action

Human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Efbemalenograstim alfa is a recombinant fusion protein containing G-CSF, a 16 amino-acid linker, and the Fc portion of human IgG2. In solution, efbemalenograstim alfa forms covalentlylinked dimers (disulfide bonds between Fc moieties) and has an immunoglobulin-like structure. Efbemalenograstim alfa is a sustained duration form of G-CSF due to decreased renal clearance. Efbemalenograstim alfa and other G-CSFs have identical modes of action, causing a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes.

Neutrophils produced in response to G-CSF show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro .

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with breast cancer, the effect of efbemalenograstim alfa on the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy regimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 30-40% (docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles). One hundred twenty-two patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either a single 20 mg dose of efbemalenograstim alfa or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in cycle 1; all subjects received efbemalenograstim alfa in cycles 2 - 4. The primary endpoint of mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 was lower for patients randomised to receive efbemalenograstim alfa compared with placebo (1.3 days versus 3.9 days, p &lt; 0.001), as was the incidence of febrile neutropenia (5% versus 26%, p &lt; 0.001). Consistent with the reduction in febrile neutropenia, the incidence of IV anti-infective use in cycle 1 was also lower in the efbemalenograstim alfa group compared with placebo (4% versus 18%).

Two additional randomised, active-controlled studies compared efbemalenograstim alfa, given as a once-per-cycle 20 mg dose, to either once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim (n=393) or daily filgrastim (n=239) for reducing the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  In the pegfilgrastim comparison, patients with metastatic or non-metastatic breast cancer received a docetaxel and cyclophosphamide regimen. In this study, the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 for both the efbemalenograstim alfa and pegfilgrastim groups was 0.2 days (difference 0.0 days, 95% CI -0.1, 0.1). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile neutropenia was 3.0% of efbemalenograstim alfa-treated patients compared with 0.5% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients (difference 2.5%, 95% CI -7.3%, 12.4%). In the comparison to filgrastim (median of 8 daily doses), patients with non-metastatic breast cancer received an epirubicin and cyclophosphamide regimen. In this study, the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 for the efbemalenograstim alfa group was 0.3 days and in the filgrastim group was 0.2 days (median difference 0.0 days, 95% CI -0.0, 0.0). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile neutropenia was 0.8% of efbemalenograstim alfa-treated patients compared with 1.7% of filgrastim-treated patients (difference -0.8%, 95% CI -4%, 2%).

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ryzneuta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After subcutaneous injection of efbemalenograstim alfa, the peak serum concentration of efbemalenograstim alfa occurs at 36 hours [min-max: 6-96 hours] after dosing and serum concentrations of efbemalenograstim alfa are maintained during the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

## Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution ranges from 395 to 5679 mL/kg.

## Biotransformation

Efbemalenograstim alfa is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Efbemalenograstim alfa appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, which becomes saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum concentration of efbemalenograstim alfa declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see Figure 1). The half-life ranged from 19 to 84 hours after subcutaneous injection.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Efbemalenograstim alfa exhibited non-linearity and time-dependent pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 30 to 360 mcg/kg.

Figure 1. Profile of median efbemalenograstim alfa serum concentration and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 320 mcg/kg injection

<!-- image -->

Due to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of efbemalenograstim alfa is not expected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

Limited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of efbemalenograstim alfa in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years) is similar to that in adults.

## Paediatric population

There are no data available on the pharmacokinetics of efbemalenograstim alfa in children.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Preclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected pharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement.

There were no adverse events observed in offspring from pregnant rats or rabbits given efbemalenograstim alfa subcutaneously at cumulative doses approximately 2.6 and 0.7 times, respectively, the recommended human dose. Similar studies of other G-CSF products in rabbits have shown embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo loss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen when pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, oestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by efbemalenograstim alfa given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known.

## 1. What Ryzneuta is and what it is used for

## What Ryzneuta is and what it is used for

Ryzneuta contains the active substance efbemalenograstim alfa. Efbemalenograstim alfa is a protein that is produced in cells in a laboratory. It belongs to a group of proteins called 'cytokines' and is very similar to a natural protein made by your own body called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which is involved in the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow. White blood cells help your body fight infection, but chemotherapy can cause a decrease in the amount of white blood cells in your body. If the number of white blood cells is too low, your body is not able to fight off bacteria, and this may increase risk of infections.

Ryzneuta is used in adult patients who are receiving cancer medicines known as 'chemotherapy'. Ryzneuta is given to:

- -reduce the duration of 'neutropenia' (low white blood cell count);
- -reduce the chance of having 'febrile neutropenia' (low white blood cell count with a fever). Neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia can be caused by the use of medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells, such as chemotherapy.

## How Ryzneuta works

Ryzneuta works by helping your bone marrow make more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.

## 2. What you need to know before using Ryzneuta

## Do not use Ryzneuta

- -if you are allergic to efbemalenograstim alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Do not use Ryzneuta if this applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ryzneuta.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Before using Ryzneuta, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:

- -you have recently had a serious lung infection, fluid in the lungs, inflamed lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung infiltration)
- -you have any altered blood counts (such as an increased white blood cells or anaemia) or low blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot - your doctor may want to monitor you more closely
- -you have sickle cell anaemia - your doctor may monitor your condition more closely
- -you have an allergy to latex - the needle cap on the syringe may cause severe allergic reactions

If any of the above apply to you (or if you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ryzneuta.

During treatment with Ryzneuta, look out for the following signs and symptoms:

- -low blood pressure such as weakness and lightheadedness, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, red and flushed skin, skin rash and itchy areas of skin - may be signs of an allergic reaction
- -cough, fever and difficulty breathing - may be signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- -swelling or puffiness, passing water less often, difficulty breathing, stomach swelling and feeling full, and generally feeling tired - may be signs of capillary leak syndrome (a condition where fluid leaks from the small blood vessels).
- -upper left abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder - may be signs of problems with your spleen (splenomegaly, splenic rupture)
- -fever, stomach pain, general feeling of discomfort, back pain - may be signs of an inflamed aorta.

Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the signs above. You may need urgent medical treatment.

## Blood and urine checks

Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly - because medicines like Ryzneuta can harm the tiny filters (glomeruli) inside your kidneys.

## Risk of blood cancer

If you get a blood cancer such as CML, AML or MDS or are likely to develop a blood cancer, you should not receive Ryzneuta, unless your doctor tells you to.

## If the medicine stops working properly

If this medicine stops working as well as it should, your doctor will look for the reasons why. This might mean you have developed antibodies which stop the medicine from working properly.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years because it is not known yet whether it is safe and effective in this age group.

## Other medicines and Ryzneuta

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is not recommended to use Ryzneuta during pregnancy. There might be a risk to your unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Contraception in females

Women who could become pregnant should use an effective contraceptive (birth control) method whilst using Ryzneuta.

## Breastfeeding

It is not known if Ryzneuta passes into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Ryzneuta, considering the benefit of breast-feeding the baby and the benefit of Ryzneuta to the mother.

## Driving and using machines

Ryzneuta has no, or very little effect on the ability to drive or use tools or machines.

## Ryzneuta contains sorbitol (E420), sodium and latex

This medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol in each 20 mg dose.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 20 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

The needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (latex), which may cause allergic reactions.

## 3. How to use Ryzneuta

## How Ryzneuta is given

Always take Ryzneuta exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.

This medicine is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection).

## Injecting Ryzneuta yourself

Your doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Ryzneuta yourself. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained.

For further instructions on how to inject yourself with Ryzneuta, please read the section at the end of this leaflet.

Do not shake Ryzneuta vigorously as this may affect its activity.

## How much and how often Ryzneuta is given

The recommended dose is one 20 mg injection, which is given at the end of each chemotherapy cycle at least 24 hours after your last dose of chemotherapy for that cycle.

## If you use more Ryzneuta than you should

You may observe similar adverse events as when you are using the recommended dose. You should talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you use more Ryzneuta than you should.
