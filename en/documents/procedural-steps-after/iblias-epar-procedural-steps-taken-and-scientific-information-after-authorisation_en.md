1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| A31/0002   | Pursuant to Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities. The PRAC was requested to assess the potential impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a recommendation as to whether the marketing authorisations of these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The EMA concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear and consistent evidence of a difference in the incidence of inhibitor development between the two classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from plasma and those made by recombinant DNA technology. Due to the different characteristics of individual products within the two classes, EMA concluded that the risk of inhibitor development should be evaluated individually for each medicine, regardless of class. The risk for each product will continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes available. product   | 14/09/2017   | 10/11/2017 no   | SmPC and PL longer   | Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448 authorised   |
