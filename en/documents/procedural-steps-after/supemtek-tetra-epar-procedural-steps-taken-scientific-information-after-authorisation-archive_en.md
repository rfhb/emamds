1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

|         | VAP00027; this is a Phase III, non-randomised, open-label, uncontrolled study to demonstrate the non-inferior HAI immune response of Supemtek Tetra in participants aged 9 to 17 years compared to participants aged 18 to 49 years; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been approved. C.I.4 - Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update paediatric information of children between 3 to 8 years of age based on final results from study VAP00026; this is a Phase III, randomised, modified double-blind, active-controlled 2-arm to demonstrate the non-inferior HAI immune response of Supemtek Tetra compared to an authorised inactivated tetravalent influenza vaccine. The MAH also took the opportunity to include editorial updates in the SmPC and Annex II. The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) -   |            |     |
