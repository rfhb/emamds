2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study of single-agent oral ixazomib as maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. In addition, the MAH proposes to remove NINLARO from the list of medicines subject to additional monitoring and to remove the black triangle from the SmPC. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP version 10.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

Annex II.E and the RMP (version 2.1) are updated accordingly. In addition the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to include the date of marketing authorisation in section 9 of the SmPC, to make a small correction in the Product Information to the Finnish, German and Swedish translations.

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study conducted in China (N=115) comparing ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, with a similar study design and eligibility criteria than the main C16010 study. Many of the patients enrolled in the study had advanced disease with Durie-Salmon Stage III (69%) at initial diagnosis and a treatment history of receiving at least 2 prior therapies (60%) and being thalidomide refractory (63%). At the primary analysis (median follow up of 8 months and a median of 6 cycles), the median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.7 months in the Ninlaro regimen |

At the final analysis for OS at a median follow up of 19.8 months, overall survival (OS) was improved for patients treated in the ixazomib regimen compared with placebo [p-value=0.0014, HR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.242, 0.726 ]). Based on the final results of the C16010 China continuation study, the pooled safety data from the pivotal studies global C16010 and C10610 China continuation studies have been reflected in section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the SmPC and the frequency of the adverse drug reactions 'Herpes zoster' was therefore updated from 'uncommon' to 'common' and 'vomiting' from common to uncommon.   |
