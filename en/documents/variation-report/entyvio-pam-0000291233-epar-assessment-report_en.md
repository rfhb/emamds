## 1. Introduction

On 1 August 2025, the MAH submitted a completed study for Entyvio including also pediatric patients, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

This was a special drug use-results surveillance study of Entyvio for IV infusion 300 mg in ulcerative colitis (UC) that was conducted as a post approval commitment following approval in Japan for use in adult population to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in UC participants in the routine clinical practice setting. The study could include participants under 18 years of age (It is noted that participants under approximately 15 years of age are considered paediatric according to Japan's labelling guidance).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study Vedolizumab-5033 is not part of a PIP.

Paediatric data with vedolizumab is being generated in a dedicated paediatric program in line with an agreed PIP and the Entyvio Product Information will be updated as appropriate when such data become available. The PIP is in place for vedolizumab in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) (EMEA-000645-PIP01-09). A waiver is granted for the paediatric population from birth to &lt;2 years of age and the PIP applies to the paediatric population subsets including children aged 2 to &lt;18 years.

No changes to the currently approved Entyvio Product Information are proposed by MAH and no variation is planned as a result of this study. A line listing of the concerned study is annexed.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report for the study Entyvio for Intravenous Infusion 300 mg Special Drug Use-Results Surveillance Study 'Ulcerative Colitis', a post approval observational prospective cohort study in Japan (following approval in adult population) in participants with moderate or severe active UC.

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

Entyvio for Intravenous Infusion 300 mg Special Drug Use-Results Surveillance Study 'Ulcerative Colitis' (Vedolizumab -5033)

## Description

Vedolizumab-5033 is a special drug use-results surveillance study of Entyvio for IV infusion 300 mg in UC that was conducted as a post approval commitment following approval in Japan for use in adult population to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in UC participants in the routine clinical practice setting . This study could include participants under 18 years of age .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

The 'central registration system' using the web-based electronic data Capture (EDC) system was used. The investigator or a person appointed by the investigator entered participant registration information into the EDC system and the investigator electronically signed it within 14 days after the start of the treatment with Entyvio. Data on stool frequency and bleeding as part of QoL and Mayo scores were collected via the participant diary (Medidata s electronic patient-reported outcome [ePRO]) in principle.

## Study participants

The target population included participants with moderately to severely active UC and who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. The study had no age restrictions as per the protocol. Participants for whom Entyvio was contraindicated were excluded.

## Treatments

The usual adult dose in Japan is 300 mg of vedolizumab per administration via intravenous infusion. After the initial dose, vedolizumab was administered at Week 2 and Week 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until Week 54.

## Objective(s)

To examine and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Entyvio in UC participants for long-term and actual use during the routine clinical setting in Japan.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The study collected effectiveness and safety information including complete Mayo Score, Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), AEs, concomitant medications, surgical procedures, and laboratory parameters.

Effectiveness analyses were conducted stratified by antiTNFα use. The effectiveness was analyzed based on response and treatment persistence, complete Mayo score, partial Mayo score, SIBDQ score, and SIBDQ subscores.

## Sample size

The planned sample size was 1000 participants with ≥300 participants anti -TNFα antibody exposed and ≥300 participants anti -TNFα antibody naïve.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Statistical Methods

The end of induction period analyses included the participants who received 3 doses of vedolizumab (Week 0, Week 2, and Week 6) or who discontinued treatment before 4th dose. For participants who received the 4th dose (Week 14), data collected immediately before the 4th dose administration was used. For participants who did not receive the 4th dose, the data closest to Day 99, which was 8 weeks after the Week 6 dose (=14 x 7+1), was used, with the window +28 days after Week 14 (Day 126).

For Week 52 (maintenance period, the analysis set was limited to participants who received the 4th dose (those who transitioned to the maintenance phase). Participants who discontinued before the 4th dose were included in the end of induction period analysis (after the 3rd dose analyses), while those who discontinued after the 4th dose were included in the Week 52 analysis. Therefore, data at the time of discontinuation was counted either for end of induction period analyses or the Week 52 analyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among 1110 registered participants, case report forms were collected from 1098 and 1091 were included in the SAF (safety analysis set). Overall, 904 participants were included in SAF-M (safety maintenance phase set) and 187 participants were excluded as they did not receive the 4th or subsequent doses.

Of the 1091 participants in the SAF, 1062 were included in the efficacy analysis, excluding 19 participants for violation of inclusion criteria, 9 participants with history of colectomy or stoma, and 1 participant who had received vedolizumab in the past. Overall, 880 participants were included in the effectiveness evaluation (maintenance phase) and 182 participants were excluded as they did not receive the 4th or subsequent doses.

A total of 1090 participants received 1st dose of 300 mg vedolizumab and 1 participant received 1st dose of 150 mg vedolizumab. The second dose of 300 mg vedolizumab was received by 1068 participants. The third dose of 300 mg vedolizumab was received by 1010 participants and 75 mg vedolizumab by 1 participant. A total of 904 participants received a 4th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab, 820 participants received a 5th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab, 766 participants received a 6th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab, 734 participants received a 7th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab, 697 participants received a 8th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab, and 665 participants received a 9th dose of 300 mg vedolizumab.

Common previous diseases were asthma in 1.5% participants and herpes zoster in 1.1% participants.

Common complications were hypertension in 6.9% participants, osteoporosis in 4.3% participants, gastroesophageal reflux disease in 4.5% participants, and iron deficiency anemia in 4.4% participants.

## Number analysed

Overall, 904 participants were included in SAF-M (maintenance phase set) and 880 participants were included in the effectiveness evaluation (maintenance phase). A total of 615 antiTNFα antibody naïve participants (83.4%) and 265 antiTNFα antibody exposed participants (81.5%) entered the maintenance phase.

## Efficacy results (effectiveness evaluation)

The Applicant clarified that the therapeutic response was assessed by the investigator per their clinical judgement either after the third dose or at the time of treatment discontinuation according to the Japanese package insert for vedolizumab IV 300mg (where \"response\" was defined as meeting both \"Decrease in the complete Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30% from baseline\", and \"Decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point from baseline, or a rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or less\").

Changes in SIBDQ were evaluated for subjects in the effectiveness population, who had not undergone colectomy or stoma formation during the observation period and who had SIBDQ data available at the relevant time points (N=654 at baseline; N=440 at Week 54). By end of Week 54, the SIBDQ score and all its subscores had increased compared to baseline: the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (44.70 [12.45] at baseline) was 11.50 (14.16); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.64 [1.32] at baseline) the change was 0.82 (1.51); in the social functioning subscore (4.60 [1.73] at baseline) it was 1.47 (1.81); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.42 [1.36] at baseline) it was 1.25 (1.62); and in the emotional subscore (4.33 [1.37] at baseline) it was 1.05 (1.55).

## SIBDQ results for the adolescent subgroup:

At the end of induction period (effectiveness population; median score at baseline =4.5), the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (42.70 [13.21] at baseline) was 7.30 (12.34); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.43 [1.57] at baseline), it was 0.45 (1.63); in the social functioning

subscore (4.48 [1.70] at baseline), it was 0.81 (1.53); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.20 [1.43] at baseline), it was 0.80 (1.25); and in the emotional subscore (4.09 [1.34] at baseline), it was 0.80 (1.12) (Table 3.a).

At the end of Week 54 (maintenance phase), the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (44.70 at baseline) was 4.40 (18.50); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.71 [1.47] at baseline), it was -0.04 (1.94); in the social functioning subscore (4.68 [1.74] at baseline), it was 0.54 (2.09); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.36 [1.36] at baseline), it was 0.33 (1.79); and in the emotional subscore (4.29 [1.33] at baseline), it was 0.80 (2.0) (Table 3.b).

## Safety results

Among the 1091 participants included in the SAF, 208 (19.07%) reported at least 1 AE.

Most AEs were reported in gastrointestinal disorders (5.68% participants), and infections and infestations (4.40% participants) SOC. The most frequently reported AEs were UC (3.39%, 37 participants), nasopharyngitis (1.37%, 15 participants), and infusion related reaction (1.37%, 15 participants).

A total of 82 participants (7.52%) reported at least 1 SAE and UC was the most frequently reported SAE among 37 participants (3.39%).

A total of 60 participants (5.50%) reported at least 1 related AE. The most frequently reported related AE was infusion related reaction (1.37%, 15 participants). The most frequently reported related SAE was UC (0.27%, 3 participants).

Most related SAEs were reported in gastrointestinal disorders (0.37% participants), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (0.18% participants) and infections and infestations (0.18% participants) SOC. Among infections SAEs there were 1 case of liver abscess and 1 case of herpes zoster oticus. Among respiratory SAEs there were 1 case of eosinophilic pneumonia and 1 case of organizing pneumonia. Among gastrointestinal SAEs there was 1 case of pancreatitis. There was also 1 case of colon cancer and 1 serious infusion related reaction (anaphylaxis).

Related AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported among 2.38% (26 participants) in the SAF, and the most frequently reported related AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were infusion related reaction (0.64%, 7 participants), arthralgia (0.27%, 3 participants), and malaise in (0.27%, 3 participants):

A total of 5 deaths and 9 pregnancy cases were reported during the study period.

Six events in 5 participants resulted in ' death (due to the event)' which included colon cancer, metastases to bone, metastases to lung, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.

As for the outcome of pregnancy cases, there were 5 cases with no abnormal findings in newborns, 2 cases with delivery reported (details unknown), 1 case with unknown outcome, and 1 case with intrauterine fetal death (32 weeks of gestation) (a diagnosis of umbilical cord hypertorsion was reported by pathological autopsy).

Adverse events corresponding to infusion reactions including hypersensitivity reactions and infection (other than progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) among safety specifications in the risk management plan was evaluated. There were no participants with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and serious events of malignancy occurred in 0.82% (9 participants), among them one case of colon cancer.

## Paediatric Participants

Analysis of related AEs were conducted by age groups (&lt;18 years of age, ≥18 and &lt;65 years and ≥65 years of age).

In the SAF (1091 participants), the incidence of related AEs was 0% (0/34) in participants aged &lt;18 years , 5.61% (50/892 participants) in participants aged ≥18 and &lt;65 years, and 6.06% (10/165 participants) in participants aged ≥65 years.

Although the number of participants aged &lt;18 years was relatively small, there were no safety concerns that required special attention in children or adolescents aged &lt;18 years.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The Vedolizumab-5033 study is a post-approval commitment study conducted in Japan to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of Entyvio (vedolizumab) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (following approval in adult population). The study aimed to assess the drug's performance in a real-world clinical setting , using a non-randomized, non-blinded design.

The study had no age restrictions and participants under 18 years were allowed.

In Japan Entyvio is authorized for ulcerative colitis and seems to have same indication and posology as in EU. While Entyvio is currently authorized only in adults, it is noted that participants under approximately 15 years of age are considered paediatric according to Japan's labelling guidance, as reported by the MAH.

The target population was patients with moderately to severely active UC who had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

The treatment regimen consisted of 300 mg of vedolizumab administered via intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8 weeks until week 54.

The primary objective was to examine the safety and effectiveness of Entyvio in UC patients in a realworld clinical setting. The study collected data on effectiveness and safety, including complete Mayo Score, SIBDQ, adverse events, concomitant medications, surgical procedures, and laboratory parameters. Effectiveness analyses were conducted stratified by antiTNFα use.

The study used a planned sample size of 1000 participants, with at least 300 participants exposed to antiTNFα antibodies and 300 participants n aive to antiTNFα antibodies. The induction analysis sets included participants who received at least 3 doses of vedolizumab and those who discontinued treatment before the 4th dose. For Week 52, the analysis set was limited to participants who received the 4th dose (those who transitioned to the maintenance phase).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study was conducted from February 2019 to October 2024. A total of 1110 participants were registered, and 1091 were included in the safety analysis (of which 904 participants were included in safety maintenance phase set) . The participant demographics showed that 56.9% of participants were male. The age range of the participants largely varied (12-94 years), with 3.1% being under 18 years old, and 0.6% being under 15 years old. The mean age was 44.3 years. 34 participants were enrolled who were aged 12 to &lt;18 years at enrolment (of which 7 were aged 12 to &lt;15 years, that is locally considered paediatric participants).

In terms of disease characteristics, the mean duration of disease was 9.3 years. The majority of participants, 96.4%, had moderate UC, while only 3.6% had severe UC. The extent of disease also varied, with 71.6% of participants having pancolitis, and 24.5% having left-sided colitis. Additionally, 15.9% of participants had steroid resistance, 56.1% had steroid dependence, and 2.9% had steroid intolerance.

Effectiveness results : the treatment regimen consisted of vedolizumab administered via intravenous infusion, with 1090 participants receiving the first dose of 300 mg (341 antiTNFα exposed and 750 antiTNFα naïve participants ), and 904 participants receiving the fourth dose.

The therapeutic response at the end of induction period was achieved in 85.1% (904 participants). Furthermore, the therapeutic response at the end of the induction period was achieved in 85.2% of antiTNFα antibody -naive participants and 84.9% of antiTNFα antibody -exposed participants.

At the start of the treatment there were 285 patients with complete Mayo score ≥6 and t he endoscopic subscore was ≥ 2, from which only 32 had complete Mayo score available a fter 3 doses of this drug or at treatment discontinuation.

At the end of the induction period, the complete Mayo score remission rate was 28.1% (9 participants), and the complete Mayo score improvement rate was 40.6% (13 participants) in the effectiveness population. Considering that only a limited number of participants was with complete Mayo score at baseline, and in particular at follow up, the effectiveness results have limited interpretability.

The partial Mayo score remission rate was 57.8% (539 participants), and the partial Mayo score improvement rate was 61.8% (576 participants) at the end of the induction period. Participants with partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline , had the partial Mayo score remission rate as 53.9% (341 participants), and the partial Mayo score improvement rate as 69.0% (437 participants) at the end of the induction period. The percent of patients with partial Mayo score remission and improvement was similar between antiTNF alfa naïve and anti -TNF alfa exposed patients.

Furthermore, the mean change from baseline in the SIBDQ score was 9.3 (SD 12.86). This score measures health related QoL and includes four domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional and social function, total range 10-70) and usually the improvement of at least 10 points is considered clinically meaningful.

The Applicant stated that vedolizumab effect generally persisted at the end of induction period through Week 54 after the start of treatment. The interpretation of the efficacy data is limited, particularly due to missing information during the long-term follow-up period. However, although with substantial limitations, the effectiveness outcomes observed during the maintenance phase were generally clinically meaningful and seem consistent with results from previous clinical trials of vedolizumab in adults.

The study also included a subgroup analysis of paediatric participants, which consisted of 34 participants under 18 years old.

Among the antiTNFα antibody -naive paediatric participants (n=25), 92.0% (23 subjects) had a therapeutic response at the end of the induction period, and 92.0% entered the maintenance phase. Of the participants with partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline (n=15), 60.0% (9 participants) achieved remission and 73.3% (11 participants) achieved an improvement.

Similarly, among the antiTNFα antibody -exposed paediatric participants (n=9), 77.8% (7 subjects) had a therapeutic response at the end of the induction period, and 88.9% entered the maintenance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

phase. Of the participants with partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline (N=4), 75.0% (3 participants) achieved remission and 75.0% (3 participants) achieved an improvement.

The results for SIBDQ in pediatric patients were provided and discussed upon request. While the improvements in the scores for paediatric participants were smaller compared to the overall study population, the number of adolescent subjects is very limited and due to the nature of the study no conclusion can be made.

Taking into account the limitations of the observational study, the effectiveness results observed in the pediatric population (consisting only of adolescent patients) are considered supportive and seem to be in line with adult patients with UC in Japan included in this study.

The safety analysis of the study included 1091 participants, and 208 (19.07%) of them reported at least one adverse event. The most common AEs were reported in the gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations categories, with the most frequently reported AEs being ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis, and infusion-related reaction. A total of 82 participants (7.52%) reported at least one serious adverse event (SAE), with UC being the most frequently reported SAE.

The analysis showed that 60 participants (5.50%) reported at least one related AE. The most frequently reported related AE was infusion-related reaction, and the most frequently reported related SAE was UC. The majority of related SAEs were reported in the gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and infections and infestations categories. There were reports (single cases) of serious infections, including liver abscess and herpes zoster oticus, as well as respiratory SAEs, such as eosinophilic pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. Among gastrointestinal SAEs there was 1 case of pancreatitis. There was also 1 case of colon cancer and 1 serious infusion related reaction (anaphylaxis).

The infections (including herpes zoster infections) are well-known adverse reactions of vedolizumab.

Among respiratory SAEs there was 1 case of eosinophilic pneumonia. Of note, a case of late onset vedolizumab-induced eosinophilic pneumonia in a patient with ulcerative colitis was published (Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2023 Apr 1;35(4):513-514). Upon request the Applicant further discussed the case observed in the present study. A definitive causal association cannot be established due to confounding by concomitant mesalazine. As eosinophilic pneumonia is a specific type of interstitial lung disease and since 'Interstitial Lung Disease', as a broader medical term, is already included in section 4.8 of the current SmPC, no amendments of the section 4.8 are proposed.

Although  pancreatitis  can  occur  in  UC  patients,  there  is  also  a  case  in  the  literature  regarding vedolizumab-associated  pancreatitis  in  paediatric  ulcerative  colitis  ((J  Crohns  Colitis.  2018  Mar 28;12(4):507-508.) This was further discussed upon request. The safety concern of pancreatitis was also recently examined by PRAC procedure. Based on the available clinical study and cumulative postmarketing data review, the current  literature and  what  is known  about  the mechanism  of action  of vedolizumab, and subsequent signal detection activities, the Applicant has concluded that the evidence available at this time is insufficient to support a causal relationship between vedolizumab and developing or recurrent pancreatitis.

A total of 26 participants (2.38%) reported drug related AEs that led to study drug discontinuation, with the most frequently reported related AEs being infusion-related reaction, arthralgia, and malaise. There were also five deaths not related to the drug and nine pregnancy cases reported during the study period. There were no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. However, there were nine cases of malignancy, including colon cancer.

Overall, results from the clinical program to date, as reported in the SmPC, do not suggest an increased risk for malignancy with vedolizumab treatment; however, the number of malignancies was small and long-term exposure was limited. Moreover, UC is a known risk factor for colorectal cancer. As the case of the colon cancer in this study was further discussed upon request. The Applicant concludes that the short  duration  of  vedolizumab  exposure,  the  underlying  chronic  inflammatory  condition,  and  the confounding history of infliximab use support the conclusion that vedolizumab is unlikely to be causally implicated in the development of colon cancer in this patient.

In terms of safety in pediatric participants, the study included 34 participants aged 12 to &lt;18 years at enrollment, and the analysis of related AEs by age group found that there were no drug related

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs reported in participants aged &lt;18 years. Although the number of pediatric participants was relatively small, the safety profile in this age group did not raise any concerns that required special attention.

The safety results of the study suggest that the study drug is generally well-tolerated, especially in the pediatric population, although there are some risks that need to be carefully monitored.

Overall, the results of this observational study in UC subjects conducted in Japan, including a limited number of adolescents, confirmed effectiveness and safety profile of vedolizumab, also in pediatric subgroup.

## 3. Rapporteur's conclusion and recommendation

## Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. The prespecified definition of 'therapeutic response' used for the evaluation of the effectiveness in the Vedolizumab-5033 study should be provided.
2. The MAH is requested to provide summary tables for main endpoints and discuss the effectiveness results for the maintenance phase of the study.
3. The results for SIBDQ in adolescents should be provided and discussed.
4. The possible causal relationship of vedolizumab with eosinophilic pneumonia and pancreatitis should be discussed and the inclusion of these ADR in the section 4.8 of the SmPC should be considered.
5. As the case of the colon cancer in this study was included among adverse drug reactions, the potential relationship with study drug and the consequent inclusion of this ADR in the section 4.8 of the SmPC should be discussed.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

## 4. MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

1. Vedolizumab-5033 study is a non-interventional PMS study conducted to collect information on the use of vedolizumab IV treatment for UC in routine clinical practice in Japan. Therefore, there is no prespecified definition of \"therapeutic response\" in this study. The therapeutic response was assessed by the investigator per their clinical judgement either after the third dose or at the time of treatment discontinuation according to the section of \"Precautions Concerning Dosage and Administration\" in the Japanese package insert for vedolizumab IV 300mg.

For reference, it is noted that in the section \"Clinical Studies for Efficacy and Safety\" of the Japanese package insert for vedolizumab IV 300mg, the results from the Japanese local phase 3 study (CCT-101) for UC are reported using a definition of \"response\". In that study, \"response\" was defined as meeting both of the following criteria: \"Decrease in the complete Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30% from baseline\", and \"Decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point from baseline, or a rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or less\".

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Assessor's comment

The Applicant clarified that, due to the non-interventional nature of the study, there was no prespecified definition of \"therapeutic response\". The therapeutic response was assessed by the investigator per their clinical judgement either after the third dose or at the time of treatment discontinuation according to the Japanese package insert for vedolizumab IV 300mg (where \"response\" was defined as meeting both \"Decrease in the complete Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30% from baseline\", and \"Decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point from baseline, or a rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or less\").

Issue solved.

2. Generally, the main objective of PMS studies in Japan is to collect safety data in routine clinical practice. Accordingly, the primary objective of Study Vedolizuman-5033 was to collect safety data on the use of vedolizumab IV treatment for UC in clinical practice in Japan with limited efficacy related data captured. Therefore, interpretation of the efficacy data is limited, particularly due to missing information during the long-term follow-up period.

Table 2.a, Table 2.b, and Table 2.c summarize effectiveness results for the maintenance phase, using the complete Mayo score, partial Mayo score, and SIBDQ score, respectively. Overall, the effectiveness outcomes observed during the maintenance phase were generally clinically meaningful and consistent with results from previous clinical trials of vedolizumab in adults.

The effectiveness population in the maintenance phase consisted of 880 patients. This effectiveness population in maintenance was defined as patients who met all study inclusion criteria, entered the maintenance phase by receiving at least 4 doses of vedolizumab IV (i.e., completed induction and began maintenance therapy), and did not have major protocol violations, prior colectomy or stoma, or prior vedolizumab treatment. In this population, 276 patients had a complete Mayo score collected at baseline. Amo ng them, 236 patients had a complete Mayo score of ≥6 and an endoscopic subscore of ≥2 at baseline. Forty -two patients had a complete Mayo score collected at the end of Week 54. At the end of Week 54, the complete Mayo score remission rate was 40.5% (17/42), and the complete Mayo score improvement rate was 52.4% (22/42) (Table 2.a).

A total of 765 patients had a partial Mayo score collected at baseline. Among them, 518 patients had a partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline. At the end of Week 54, among the effectiveness population in the maintenance phase with partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline, the partial Mayo score remission rate was 43.1% (223/518), and the partial Mayo score response rate was 51.5% (267/518) (Table 2.b).

Changes in SIBDQ were evaluated for subjects in the effectiveness population, who had not undergone colectomy or stoma formation during the observation period and who had SIBDQ data available at the relevant time points (N=654 at baseline; N=440 at Week 54). By end of Week 54, the SIBDQ score and all its subscores had increased compared to baseline: the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (44.70 [12.45] at baseline) was 11.50 (14.16); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.64 [1.32] at baseline) the change was 0.82 (1.51); in the social functioning subscore (4.60 [1.73] at baseline) it was 1.47 (1.81); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.42 [1.36] at baseline) it was 1.25 (1.62); and in the emotional subscore (4.33 [1.37] at baseline) it was 1.05 (1.55) (Table 2.c)

## Assessor's comment

The Applicant argues that primary objective of Study Vedolizuman-5033 was to collect safety data on the use of vedolizumab IV treatment for UC in clinical practice in Japan with limited efficacy related

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data captured. Therefore, interpretation of the efficacy data is limited, particularly due to missing information during the long-term follow-up period.

The Applicant provided tables which summarize effectiveness results for the maintenance phase, using the complete Mayo score, partial Mayo score, and SIBDQ score, respectively.

At the end of Week 54, the complete Mayo score remission rate was 40.5% (17/42), and the complete Mayo score improvement rate was 52.4% (22/42) among patients for which complete Mayo score was available also at the end of week 54.

At the end of Week 54, among the effectiveness population in the maintenance phase with partial Mayo score of ≥5 at baseline, the partial Mayo score remission rate was 43.1% (223/518), and the partial Mayo score response rate was 51.5% (267/518).

Regarding the QoL Survey, by end of Week 54, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (44.70 [12.45] at baseline) was 11.50 (14.16). Also, all its subscores (systemic symptom, social functioning, abdominal symptom and emotional subscore) had increased compared to baseline.

It is agreed that, although with abovementioned limitations, the effectiveness outcomes observed during the maintenance phase were generally clinically meaningful and consistent with results from previous clinical trials of vedolizumab in adults.

Issue solved.

3. Subgroup analyses of the SIBDQ score in paediatric participants (aged &lt;18 years) are summarized in Table 3.a and Table 3.b. Scores were generally improved both at the end of the induction period and at Week 54 compared to baseline, although there are limitations to the interpretation due to the small number of paediatric participants. While the improvements in the scores for paediatric participants were smaller compared to the overall study population, the difference was not considered clinically meaningful. As a note, no statistical testing was performed in this study.

At the end of induction period (effectiveness population; median score at baseline =4.5), the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (42.70 [13.21] at baseline) was 7.30 (12.34); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.43 [1.57] at baseline), it was 0.45 (1.63); in the social functioning subscore (4.48 [1.70] at baseline), it was 0.81 (1.53); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.20 [1.43] at baseline), it was 0.80 (1.25); and in the emotional subscore (4.09 [1.34] at baseline), it was 0.80 (1.12) (Table 3.a).

At the end of Week 54 (maintenance phase), the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SIBDQ score (44.70 at baseline) was 4.40 (18.50); in the systemic symptom subscore (4.71 [1.47] at baseline), it was -0.04 (1.94); in the social functioning subscore (4.68 [1.74] at baseline), it was 0.54 (2.09); in the abdominal symptom subscore (4.36 [1.36] at baseline), it was 0.33 (1.79); and in the emotional subscore (4.29 [1.33] at baseline), it was 0.80 (2.0) (Table 3.b).

## Assessor's comment

The Applicant provided the results of SIBDQ for the adolescent subgroup, as a change from baseline to the end of induction and maintenance phase. While the improvements in the scores for paediatric participants were smaller compared to the overall study population, the number of adolescent subjects is very limited and due to the nature of the study no conclusion can be made.

Issue solved.

## 4. Eosinophilic pneumonia

The eosinophilic pneumonia case referenced in the CSR concerns a female aged with a history of ulcerative colitis (diagnosed in 2015) and a prior history of breast cancer. Concomitant medications included mesalazine, azathioprine, and tamoxifen. On 2020, one day after starting vedolizumab, the patient developed a severe cough. On 2020, a chest X-ray was negative for pneumonia, and the WBC count was 8,800/mm3 (eosinophils 300/mm3); CRP was 5.47 mg/L. She was treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg for one week. On 2020, the patient received the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

second dose of vedolizumab. The WBC count was 8,000/mm³ (eosinophil count 1,170/mm³), and the CRP was 0.48 mg/L. On 2020, CT imaging confirmed eosinophilic pneumonia (WBC 6,900/mm³; eosinophils 1,020/mm³), leading to initiation of prednisolone therapy, which was subsequently tapered over several months.

On 2020, a chest X-ray showed improvement, with normalization of WBC (4,200/mm³) and eosinophil count (60/mm³). Eosinophilic pneumonia was considered resolved. The patient was later switched to ustekinumab on an unknown date due to eosinophilic pneumonia experienced while on vedolizumab.

Company Causality Assessment: The temporal association between vedolizumab initiation and event onset suggests a possible relationship; however, a definitive causal association cannot be established due to confounding by concomitant mesalazine, which is recognized as causally associated with eosinophilic pneumonia and is listed as an adverse drug reaction in EU SmPC. Additionally, there is limited information regarding underlying conditions and prior therapies.

Eosinophilic pneumonia is a specific type of interstitial lung disease characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the lungs. Since 'Interstitial Lung Disease', as a broader medical term, is already included in section 4.8 of the current SmPC, we consider that the current SmPC is sufficient.

## Pancreatitis

The pancreatitis case referenced in the CSR involves a female aged who received vedolizumab (Entyvio) 300 mg IV for UC, diagnosed in 2018. Her medical history included herpes zoster, endometriosis, and cytapheresis. Current medical conditions were gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoporosis, zinc deficiency, and steroid dependence. Concomitant medications included mesalazine, esomeprazole, prednisolone, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, Bio-three, and ustekinumab.

On 2021, one month after starting vedolizumab, the patient reported epigastric pain and started on acetaminophen 500 mg. The following day, an ultrasound revealed a pancreatic cyst, and her lipase was 992 U/L. As a 5-ASA preparation was suspected as a possible cause, Lialda (mesalazine tablets) was switched to Pentasa (mesalazine granules).

On 2021, the patient presented with back pain in addition to epigastric pain. Laboratory results showed amylase 632 U/L, lipase 2,186 U/L, and urinary amylase 3,280 U/L. Vedolizumab was suspected as being the cause and thus discontinued. Pentasa was switched back to Lialda, which was followed by worsening UC symptoms requiring an increased prednisolone dose and the introduction of ustekinumab therapy. The patient did not take Lialda from 2021, although it had been prescribed.

By 2021, the epigastric and back pain had improved, along with slight improvement in UC symptoms. On 2021, amylase was between 270 and &lt;280 U/L; Lialda was resumed the next day, though back pain persisted. On 2021, amylase was 224 U/L and lipase 762 U/L. On 2021, back pain worsened and Lialda was discontinued due to a possible late-onset 5-ASA intolerance. The discontinuation of Lialda led to normalization of the amylase (115 U/L), and a subsequent ultrasound confirmed pancreatitis. By 2021, epigastric pain had improved, pancreatitis was resolved, and the study observation period was concluded.

The MAH assessed the event of pancreatitis as unlikely related to vedolizumab. The event was confounded by the use of mesalazine, as normalization of pancreatic enzymes and improvement of symptoms following mesalazine withdrawal suggests a stronger association with 5-ASA therapy. Mesalazine is known to be causally associated with pancreatitis which is listed as an ADR in the EU SmPCs.

Takeda's evaluation of the literature case cited in the assessment report was previously submitted to EMA in January 2023 as part of an earlier review on pancreatitis (Data Lock Point: 15 September 2022) in response to a PRAC request for a comprehensive analysis of all known cases of pancreatitis associated with vedolizumab treatment during Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/002782/II/0073, eCTD sequence 0165. Additionally, a cumulative review of pancreatitis cases was submitted to PRAC (Data Lock Point: 19 May 2022) in the most recently

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submitted PBRER (covering 20 May 2021 to 19 May 2024; eCTD sequence 0189) evaluated with Procedure Number PSUSA/00010186/202405 that completed in March 2025. Neither of these reviews found evidence of a causal relationship between vedolizumab treatment and pancreatitis.

Patients with IBD have an increased incidence of pancreatitis compared with the general population and have a myriad of conditions that result in direct pancreatic damage. Cholelithiasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and ERCP are some of the conditions that predispose patients with IBD to developing pancreatitis (Roberts et al. 2017; Weiss et al. 2019). In addition, concurrent medical conditions and concomitant medications may also contribute to the risk of developing pancreatitis, independent of IBD activity. A recent systematic literature review was conducted using four major databases, which identified eight eligible observational studies for analysis (Tel et al. 2020). This study found that the pooled odds for AP in IBD are 3 times higher (OR, 3.11) than in the non-IBD population, the odds are higher in CD than in UC. Also, the study found that the pooled annual incidence of AP in IBD was 210/100,000 person -years (95% CI, 84-392/100,000 person-years).

Patients with IBDs are at an increased risk of pancreatitis; however, the role of IBD therapy in the development of pancreatitis is currently unclear. Distinguishing IBD from pancreatitis in patients is often difficult owing to similarities in the clinical symptoms presented; for example, abdominal pain and diarrhea are typically experienced by both patient populations. The publication by Joe F. Wernicke et al. (Wernicke et al. 2023) reported that an integrated summary of safety data from six clinical trials evaluating vedolizumab in patients with IBD showed that only 0.7% of patients (n = 12/1723) taking vedolizumab developed acute or chronic pancreatitis; however, no association between taking vedolizumab and onset of pancreatitis was confirmed. Sara Massironi et al. (Massironi et al. 2022) reported that nine studies were identified on biological agents. This study mentioned that drug-induced AP is an extremely rare adverse effect of biological agents with only a few cases reported for infliximab and vedolizumab.

Based on the available clinical study and cumulative post-marketing data review, the current literature and what is known about the mechanism of action of vedolizumab, and subsequent signal detection activities, Takeda has concluded that the evidence available at this time is insufficient to support a causal relationship between vedolizumab and developing or recurrent pancreatitis. In conclusion, the addition of pancreatitis to the ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC is not warranted. Takeda will continue to monitor the event of pancreatitis in patients exposed to vedolizumab treatment by routine pharmacovigilance activities.

## Assessor's comment

The Applicant provided the narratives (both adult patients) and discussion regarding the requested.

possible causal relationship of vedolizumab with eosinophilic pneumonia and pancreatitis, as As regards a case of eosinophilic pneumonia, the temporal association between vedolizumab initiation and event onset suggests a possible relationship; however, a definitive causal association cannot be established due to confounding by concomitant mesalazine, which is recognized as causally associated with eosinophilic pneumonia and is listed as an adverse drug reaction in EU SmPC. The Applicant argues that, as eosinophilic pneumonia is a specific type of interstitial lung disease and since 'Interstitial Lung Disease', as a broader medical term, is already included in section 4.8 of the current SmPC, no amendments of the section 4.8 are proposed. This is agreed. Regarding the case of pancreatitis, the MAH assessed it as unlikely related to vedolizumab. The event was confounded by the use of mesalazine, as normalization of pancreatic enzymes and improvement of symptoms following mesalazine withdrawal suggests a stronger association with 5-ASA therapy. Mesalazine is known to be causally associated with pancreatitis which is listed as an ADR in the EU SmPCs. The Applicant reported that the evaluation of the literature case cited in the assessment report was previously submitted to EMA in January 2023 as part of an earlier review on pancreatitis (Data Lock Point: 15 September 2022) in response to a PRAC request for a comprehensive

analysis of all known cases of pancreatitis associated with vedolizumab treatment during Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/002782/II/0073. Additionally, a cumulative review of pancreatitis cases was submitted to PRAC (Data Lock Point: 19 May 2022) in the most recently submitted PBRER (covering 20 May 2021 to 19 May 2024) evaluated with Procedure Number PSUSA/00010186/202405 that completed in March 2025. Neither of these reviews found evidence of a causal relationship between vedolizumab treatment and pancreatitis. This is acknowledged.

## 5. Clarification of ADR Designation:

The 'Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)' designation throughout the CSR refers to adverse events reported by the investigator as related to study drug; this does not imply a confirmed causal relationship as per ICH E2A/E2D definitions. Takeda conducts an independent assessment in accordance with regulatory standards, which requires a 'reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for SmPC inclusion.

## Case Assessment and Epidemiological Context:

This colon cancer case, described in the clinical study report, involves a male aged with UC who received vedolizumab 300 mg IV for the treatment of pancolitis, diagnosed in 2020. The case was reported by the treating physician as part of a specified drug-use survey.

The patient's current medical conditions included Hepatitis B virus infection. At the time of colon cancer discovery, the patient had been diagnosed with UC for 33 months. His medical history included meningitis due to Listeria, iron deficiency anemia, epilepsy, cerebral infarction, deep vein thrombosis, depression, neurogenic bladder, and steroid resistance. Prior medication history included infliximab and concomitant medications included mesalazine and tenofovir alafenamide.

Vedolizumab therapy was initiated in 2022, with subsequent doses administered through 2023. The seventh and final dose was given in 2023.

In 2023, approximately 10 months after starting vedolizumab, a follow-up colonoscopy revealed a suspected ascending colon cancer, which was subsequently confirmed.

In 2023, the patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, total colectomy, and ileostomy. Colon cancer was resolved following surgery.

The treating physicians assessed the event of ascending colon cancer as related, noting that a causal relationship with vedolizumab could not be ruled out. However, Takeda assessed the event as unlikely to be related to vedolizumab. This assessment is supported by multiple studies demonstrating that vedolizumab is not associated with an increased risk of malignancy, including colorectal cancer, in patients with IBD. Long-term safety data and comparative analyses with other biologics have consistently shown no elevated cancer risk attributable to vedolizumab (Feagan et al. 2013; Sands et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2022).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Importantly, the development of colorectal cancer in UC patients is primarily driven by chronic inflammation. In this case, the patient had pancolitis for nearly three years prior to cancer detection, suggesting that the malignancy may have been developing independently of vedolizumab exposure. Furthermore, the case is confounded by prior use of infliximab, which carries a boxed warning for malignancies and has been associated with increased cancer risk in some studies (Eaden et al. 2001; Eaden and Mayberry 2002; Remicade (infliximab) 2025).

Taken together, the short duration of vedolizumab exposure, the underlying chronic inflammatory condition, and the confounding history of infliximab use support the conclusion that vedolizumab is unlikely to be causally implicated in the development of colon cancer in this patient.

Based on all available data, there is not sufficient evidence supporting the inclusion of colon cancer in section 4.8 of the SmPC as an ADR.

## Assessor's comment

The Applicant provided narrative and discussion regarding the case of colon cancer in an adult patient.

Initially, the Applicant clarified that the 'Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)' designation throughout the CSR refers to adverse events reported by the investigator as related to study drug; this does not imply a confirmed causal relationship as per ICH E2A/E2D definitions. The Applicant conducts an independent assessment, which requires a 'reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for SmPC inclusion.

The Applicant concludes that the short duration of vedolizumab exposure, the underlying chronic inflammatory condition, and the confounding history of infliximab use support the conclusion that vedolizumab is unlikely to be causally implicated in the development of colon cancer in this patient.

Based on all available data, there is not sufficient evidence supporting the inclusion of colon cancer in section 4.8 of the SmPC as an ADR.

Issue solved.

## 5. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In summary, taking into account the limitations of the observational study, the effectiveness results observed in the pediatric subpopulation (consisting only of adolescent patients) are considered supportive and seem to be in line with the results in adult patients with UC in Japan included in this study. With regards to safety, the adverse events are in line with those reflected in section 4.8 of the EU SmPC. Some additional information regarding eosinophilic pneumonia, pancreatitis, and colon cancer (one adult case each) reported as SAE was requested, and the applicant has provided narratives and discussion. It is agreed with the applicant that these events are currently considered to be unrelated to vedolizumab or already included as a broader term in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No new safety concerns are evoked.
