## 1. Introduction

On 15 th  December 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for ceftolozane/ tazobactam, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that CXA-PEDS-13-08 [Open-label, single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and  safety  of  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  in  children  (0-18  years)  with  proven  or  suspected  Gramnegative infection receiving standard antibiotic therapy] is part of a clinical development program. The variation  application  consisting  of  the  full  relevant  data  package  (containing  several  studies)  is expected to be submitted by 12/21. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

There is  no specific paediatric formulation for ceftolozane/tazobactam; the formulation approved for use in adults was administered in this study. A fixed ratio of 2:1 ceftolozane/tazobactam was used in this trial.

Route of Administration and Dosage Form: Intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 (±10) minutes.

Physical Description: A 1.5 g dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam lyophilized powder contains 1000 mg of active ceftolozane and tazobactam sodium at a quantity equivalent of 500 mg of tazobactam free acid when it is reconstituted and diluted for use. Inactive ingredients include sodium chloride as a stabilizer and L-arginine and citric acid for pH adjustment.

To minimize the infusion volume in younger cohorts, varying age-appropriate volumes from the fixed concentration, not to exceed 15 mg/mL, of ceftolozane/ tazobactam will be administered to achieve the intended dose in each paediatric patient. Infusion rates will differ based on the volume of each dose in each patient.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- CXA-PEDS-13-08 Open-label, single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of ceftolozane/  tazobactam  in  children  (0-18  years)  with  proven  or  suspected  Gram-negative  infection receiving standard antibiotic therapy.

## Assessor's comments:

Ceftolozane/tazobactam (Zerbaxa) is licensed in the European Union (18 th  September 2015) for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), in combination with metronidazole, as well as for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aged 18 years and older.

This  is  the  first  completed  paediatric  clinical  trial  of  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  and  one  of  3  deferred clinical studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP). This PIP was first agreed in October 2012,  with  2  subsequent  modifications,  the  last  (EMEA-001142-PIP01-11-M02),  agreed  in  January 2017 (P/0088/2017). This PIP is due to be completed by June 2021. There are no waivers. A positive opinion on the interim compliance check of completed non-clinical studies was adopted in June 2014, prior to filing for adult MA.  (EMEA-C2-001142-PIP01-11-M01). All concerned studies are listed in the Annex of this report.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## CXA-PEDS-13-08

Open-label, single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam in children (0-18 years) with proven or suspected Gram-negative infection receiving standard antibiotic therapy

## Description

This was a Phase 1, single-dose, non-comparative, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam in paediatric subjects from birth (7 days postnatal) to &lt;18 years  receiving  concurrent  standard-of-care  antibiotic  therapy  for  treatment  of  proven  or  suspected gram negative infection or peri-operative prophylaxis.

Subjects received a single age-based intravenous (IV) dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam as a 60 (±10)minute (min) infusion. The doses were subject to change (up to a maximum of 30 mg/kg ceftolozane and 15 mg/kg tazobactam, not to exceed a fixed dose of 1.5 g ceftolozane/tazobactam) based upon interim analysis of PK and safety data.

A data monitoring or endpoint adjudication committee was not utilized.

## Methods

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  PK  of  a  single  dose  of  IV  ceftolozane/ tazobactam in paediatric subjects from birth to &lt;18 years receiving standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected gram-negative infection, including subjects receiving peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics.

The secondary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of IV ceftolozane/tazobactam  in  paediatric  subjects  from  birth  to  &lt;18  years  receiving  standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected gram-negative infection, including subjects receiving perioperative prophylactic antibiotics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

A  Phase  1,  Non-Comparative,  Open-Label  Study  to  Characterize  the  Pharmacokinetics  of  a  Single Intravenous  Dose  of  Ceftolozane/tazobactam  in  Paediatric  Patients  Receiving  Standard  of  Care Antibiotic Therapy for Proven or Suspected Gram-Negative Infection or for Peri-Operative Prophylaxis.

## Study population /Sample size

A total  of  36  subjects  (6  subjects  per  6  age  groups)  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  in  this  trial.  This sample size was chosen based primarily on empirical considerations and feasibility, and was considered sufficient to meet the trial objectives. With 6 subjects in each age group, the probability of detecting at least 1 AE with a true event rate of 5% was 26%. With a total of 36 subjects across all age groups, the probability of detecting at least 1 AE with a true event rate of 5% was 84%.

## Treatments

The initial paediatric doses of ceftolozane/tazobactam were chosen based on adult PK data with the objective  of  achieving  the  therapeutic  exposure  levels  seen  in  healthy  adults.  Subjects  enrolled received a single age-based IV dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam as a 60 (±10)-minute (min) infusion. The  age-based  doses  were  subject  to  change  (up  to  a  maximum  of  30  mg/kg  ceftolozane  and  15 mg/kg tazobactam, not to exceed a fixed dose of 1.5 g ceftolozane/ tazobactam) based upon interim analyses of PK and safety data. The groups with their initial dosing regimens and proposed recruitment numbers are outlined below:

- Group 1 (N=6) ≥12 to &lt;18 years
-  Single IV dose, 1.5 g fixed dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam (1000 mg ceftolozane and 500 mg tazobactam).
- Group 2 (N=6) ≥7 to &lt;12 years
-  Single IV dose, 18 mg/kg ceftolozane and 9 mg/kg tazobactam.
- Group 3 (N=6) ≥2 to &lt;7 years
-  Single IV dose, 18 mg/kg ceftolozane and 9 mg/kg tazobactam.
- Group 4 (N=6) ≥3 months to &lt;2 years
-  Single IV dose, 18 mg/kg ceftolozane and 9 mg/kg tazobactam.
- Group 5 (N=6) Birth (&gt;32 weeks gestation, 7 days postnatal) to &lt;3 months
-  Single IV dose, 12 mg/kg ceftolozane and 6 mg/kg tazobactam.
- Group 6 (N=6) Birth (≤32 weeks gestation, 7 days postnatal) to &lt;3 months
-  Single IV dose, 12 mg/kg ceftolozane and 6 mg/kg tazobactam.

Subjects participated in the trial for 6 to 12 days. Screening and/or baseline assessments to determine eligibility took place within 48 hours of trial treatment administration (Day 1).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: AUC and Cmax

Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Zerbaxa

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  primary  endpoints  were  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  and  maximum concentration  (Cmax)  for  ceftolozane,  tazobactam,  and  the  tazobactam  metabolite  (M1)  as  data allowed.

## Secondary endpoint

The secondary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of single doses of IV ceftolozane/tazobactam in paediatric  subjects  and  it  was  evaluated  through  assessments  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests in the Safety population.

## Statistical Methods

Descriptive statistics were used to guide decisions as to the clinical relevance of findings. No formal hypothesis  testing  was  planned  or  performed.  All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  SAS statistical software version 9.4, unless otherwise noted. For all analyses, baseline was defined as the most recent measurement prior to the first administration of study drug, unless otherwise specified.

Plasma  PK  parameters  for  ceftolozane,  tazobactam,  and  tazobactam  M1  were  determined  using noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin Phoenix version 6.30). The following PK parameters were determined for all analytes (ceftolozane, tazobactam, and M1, except as noted below) as allowed by the data.

- Cmax
- Time of maximum concentration (Tmax)
- Last quantifiable concentration (Clast)
- Time of last quantifiable concentration (Tlast)
- Area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  from  time  0  to  last  quantifiable  concentration (AUClast)
- Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞)
- Terminal half-life (T1/2)
- Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) (ceftolozane and tazobactam only)
- Plasma clearance (CL) (ceftolozane and tazobactam only)

The  AUC  was  calculated  by  the  trapezoidal  method  using  the  linear-up/  log-down  rule.  All  predose below-limit-of quantification (BLQ) values in period 1 were set to zero; missing or BLQ values obtained after the first quantifiable concentration were treated as missing. Actual blood draw times were used to calculate PK parameters.

The PK population included all subjects who received a full dose of trial treatment and provided blood samples with quantifiable plasma levels at the  Cmax (1-hour post infusion  start time point) and at least 2 time points after Cmax (2, 4, or 6 hours post infusion time points) to allow an estimation of AUC.

Safety was assessed through collection of AEs, laboratory evaluations (haematology, chemistry, and coagulation), vital signs, and physical examinations. The safety evaluation was based on clinical review of the following safety parameters:

- Incidence of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs);
- •
- AEs and SAEs by relationship to trial treatment;

Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Zerbaxa

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- AEs and SAEs by severity;
- Deaths;
- Premature  discontinuation  from  the  trial  and  trial  treatment  due  to  an  AE,  regardless  of relationship to trial treatment;
- Clinical laboratory data;
- Vital signs; and
- Concomitant medications
- The Safety population included all subjects who received any amount of trial treatment.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 43 subjects were enrolled; 6 (14.0%) were enrolled but not dosed, and 37 (86.0%) received trial  treatment  and  were  included  in  the  Safety  population.  All  37  (100.0%)  subjects  in  the  Safety population completed the trial; 34 of 37 were included in the PK population. No subjects were excluded from the analysis populations (PK or Safety) due to a protocol deviation.

## Baseline data

Nineteen subjects (51.4%) were male and 18 (48.6%) were female, and the majority of subjects were white  (67.6%).  Other  than  1  subject  in  Group  4  who  was  receiving  antibiotics  for  perioperative prophylaxis, all subjects were receiving antibiotics for a proven or suspected gram-negative infection. (Table 1.)

All  subjects  in  the  Safety  population  were  taking  at  least  1  concomitant  medication.  The  types  of medications subjects were taking were typical of hospitalized paediatric subjects with gram-negative infections.  Treatment  compliance  was  not  measured.  All  subjects  received  a  single  IV  dose  of ceftolozane/ tazobactam on Day 1, which was administered in a hospital or clinic. Study personnel at the site recorded the dosage and timing of treatment administration.

## Assessor's comments:

Thirty-seven  (37)  paediatric  patients  representing  all  the  study-defined  paediatric  age  groups  were enrolled.  One  (1)  subject  in  Group  4  received  antibiotics  for  perioperative  prophylaxis  and  all  other patients had either proven or suspected Gram negative infection. These conditions were defined within the study parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy results

There are no efficacy results.

## Assessor's comments:

This completed Phase I study was designed to assess the PK and safety of ceftolozane/ tazobactam, thus no assessment or conclusion regarding the efficacy of ceftolozane/ tazobactam in the paediatric population can be made.

## Safety results

Overall,  11  subjects  (29.7%)  experienced  at  least 1  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE).  No severe TEAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of trial treatment were reported, and there were no deaths  during  the  trial.  Two  subjects  had  non-serious  treatment-related  TEAEs  which  were  mild  in severity and resolved by the end of the study (1 subject in Group 1 with dizziness and 1 subject in Group 3 [30/15 mg/kg dose] with bradycardia and tachycardia). Three subjects had serious adverse events  (SAEs)  (1  subject  from  Group  1  with  pneumonia,  1  subject  from  Group  2  with  infective pulmonary  exacerbation  of  cystic  fibrosis,  and  1  subject  from  Group  4  [30/15  mg/kg  dose]  with device-related  sepsis),  which  were  all  deemed  unrelated  to  trial  treatment.  In  Groups  5  or  6,  no subject experienced a treatment-related TEAE. However, three subjects had at least 1 adverse events (AE) (1 subject in Group 5 and 2 subjects in Group 6 [12/6 mg/kg dose]). Only 1 of the reported AE was experienced by more than 1 subject; anaemia was experienced by 1 Subject in Group 5 and 1 subject in Group 6 (Table 2). Anaemia, diarrhoea, and hypokalaemia were the only AEs reported twice.

No subjects had abnormal liver function tests that met the criteria for closely monitored events. There were  no  events  indicative  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  or  haemolytic  disorders,  nor  any  events involving Clostridium difficile . No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) were observed after administration of ceftolozane/tazobactam.

The  safety  profile  observed  in  the  trial  was  similar  to  the  safety  profile  observed  in  the  adult population, and no new safety signals were identified. Treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam was well tolerated.  In  general,  adverse  events  occurred  with  low  frequency,  were  widely  distributed  across multiple  body  systems,  and  were  typical  of  hospitalized  paediatric  subjects  with  gram-negative infections.

## Assessor's comments:

All  paediatric  patients  recruited  into  the  study  and  who  received  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  were included in the safety analysis. There were no deaths in the study and no SAEs or TEAEs leading to the discontinuation  of  the  trial  product.  Two  subjects  had  non-serious  TEAEs  and  3  subjects  had  SAEs unrelated to trial treatment.

Changes  in  laboratory  parameters  were  recorded  in  all  patients  over  the  duration  of  the  study, however,  these  were  not  clinically  significant.  Regarding  closely  monitored  events,  no  paediatric subjects had abnormal liver function tests that met the critical study threshold for this adverse event. No clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) were noted.

The study was not planned to detect uncommon or rare ceftolozane/ tazobactam AEs; however, it is acknowledged that such  paediatric-specific  adverse  events  are  unlikely  to  be  detected  in  a  trial  for early  paediatric  development  that  is  limited  in  size  and  duration.  Furthermore,  the  safety  profile  of ceftolozane/ tazobactam is also confounded by use of other concomitant antibiotics.

Despite these limitations, this study provides preliminary paediatric safety  data for a single dose of ceftolozane/ tazobactam which were similar to those observed in adults. In addition, the AEs were low in frequency and no safety signals of concern were reported in the paediatric study population. Thus, the available safety data support further paediatric development. As such, the MAH's conclusions on the safety of ceftolozane/ tazobactam in the paediatric population are acceptable.

## Pharmacokinetic results

The PK population included all subjects who received a full dose of trial treatment and provided blood samples with quantifiable plasma levels at the Cmax (1-hour post infusion start time) and at least 2 time points after Cmax (2-, 4-, or 6-hour post infusion time points). Of the 37 subjects who received a complete dose of trial treatment, 34 were included in the PK population. The following 3 subjects were excluded from the PK population:

- 1  subject  from  Group  1  with  drug  concentration  BLQ  at  the  end  of  infusion.  This  subject  had measurable pre-dose concentrations, suggesting a possible sample switch.
- 1 subject from Group 5 with a site-reported infusion issue wherein drug was not completely flushed through the infusion line after administration.
- 1 subject from Group 6 (20/10 mg/kg dose) with insufficient plasma available in the PK samples for drug quantification.

Three dose modifications occurred during the conduct of the study:

- The dose for Groups 3 and 4 was increased from 18/9 mg/kg ceftolozane/tazobactam to 30/15 mg/kg, following the Group 3 interim analysis.
- The dose for Groups 5 and 6 was increased from 12/6 mg/kg ceftolozane/tazobactam to 20/10 mg/kg, following the Group 4 interim analysis.
- A  dose  of  12/6  mg/kg  ceftolozane/tazobactam  was  implemented  for  Group  6  subjects  with  a baseline calculated CrCL of 20 to 49 mL/min/1.73m 2 .

The  plasma  PK  of  ceftolozane,  tazobactam,  and  tazobactam  M1  were  characterized  following administration  of  single  IV  doses  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  to  Groups  1-6.  The  mean  ceftolozane concentration-time profiles were generally comparable across Groups 1-4, while the terminal half-life was slightly increased in Group 5 and 6 subjects. After accounting for weight, ceftolozane clearance (CL) was generally comparable across Groups 1-4, while CL values trended lower in Groups 5 and 6 for those with creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥50 mL/min/1.73m 2 . For Group 6 subjects who received the dose of 12/6 mg/kg ceftolozane/tazobactam, the geometric mean (GM) CL was approximately 2-fold lower, consistent with the lower CrCL function in these subjects. (Table 3.)

Following the interim analysis in Group 3, the dose was increased from 18/9 mg/kg to 30/15 mg/kg, an increase of 1.7-fold, which resulted in an increase in the GM AUC (0-∞ ) of approximately 1.9-fold in Group 3, suggesting that the PK of ceftolozane is approximately dose-proportional. After accounting for weight, the ceftolozane GM volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) ranged from 0.274 to 0.394 L/kg across all age groups, suggesting that the Vss was comparable across all age groups, with a slight trend  in  increased  Vss  in  subjects  aged  birth  (7  days  postnatal)  to  &lt;3  months  (Groups  5  and  6 subjects).

Differences  in  the  mean  tazobactam  concentration-time  profiles  were  observed,  and  were  more pronounced  for  Groups  5  and  6;  the  comparison  of  the  profiles  was  limited  due  to  the  limited concentration-time data at the 6-hour time point. A comparison of the CL across Groups 1-6 generally suggests  a  slight  trend  of  decreasing  tazobactam  CL  in  neonates  and  infants.  The  CL  for  Group  6 subjects who received the 12/6 mg/kg dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam was available for only 1 subject and was 0.076 L/h/kg. As this subject had a CrCL of 27.69 mL/min/1.73m2, it is likely that the low CL is due to the immature renal function of this subject.

With  an  increase  in  dose  of  1.7-fold  following  the  Group  3  interim  analysis,  an  increase  of approximately 1.6-fold in the GM tazobactam AUC (0-∞ ) was observed in Group 3, suggesting that the PK of tazobactam is approximately dose-proportional. Tazobactam Vss increased with increasing age. After accounting for weight, the tazobactam GM Vss ranged from 0.421 to 0.740 L/kg in Groups 1-6 (Group 6 subjects who received the 20/10 mg/kg dose). The Vss was available for only 1 subject in Group 6 (12/6 mg/kg dose) and was 0.338 L/kg. These results point to variability in the tazobactam data (Table 3).

Not enough data points were available for an accurate assessment of tazobactam metabolite (M1) PK parameters. The arithmetic mean tazobactam plasma concentration-time profiles showed an increase in  tazobactam  M1  concentrations  with  time,  which  peaked  at  approximately  4  hours  post  start  of infusion of ceftolozane/tazobactam. Thus, the terminal elimination phase was not captured within the 6-hour PK sampling time and AUC (0-∞ ) could not be determined for most subjects. Two subjects had predose tazobactam M1 concentrations.

## Assessor's comments:

For  ceftolozane's  interim  analyses  an  AUC  target  of  130-175  μg*h/mL  was  used,  which  covers  the range of AUCs reported in adult healthy volunteers, patients with cUTI and cIAI. An AUC target of 24 μg*h/mL was chosen for the interim analyses of tazobactam.

Interim analyses in older children from Group 1 (ages ≥12 to &lt;18 years) and Group 2 (ages ≥7 to &lt;12 years)  determined  that  the  dose  exposures  of  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  were  similar  to  those  in adults and thus no adjustment to the initial dosing was made. However, it is noted that in the final analysis  for  Group  2,  geometric  mean  AUCs  (0-∞ )  were  below  the  AUC  target  range  for  both ceftolozane  and  tazobactam.    In  this  group,  the  low  geometric  mean  Tazobactam  AUC  could  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

explained by incomplete PK sampling in 3 patients that resulted in the AUC not being calculated for these  patients.  In  contrast,  the  PK  samples  for  ceftolozane  were  sufficient  for  all  6  patients  in  this cohort.  From  Groups  3  to  6,  higher  dosing  adjustments  led  to  changes  in  PK  parameters  of  both ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  that  were  almost  dose  proportional  and  comparable  to  exposures  in adults.

Ceftolozane's  CL  and  Vss  increased  with  increasing  age,  and  a  similar  trend  was  also  observed  for tazobactam. However, there are variabilities with the tazobactam data.  For 16 subjects across all age groups, tazobactam concentrations measured at 6-hours post administration were below the limit of quantification.  In  addition,  the  concentration  time  profiles  and  Vss  were  variable  in  the  youngest cohorts  (Groups  5  and  6).  Therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  tazobactam  PK  parameters  across  age cohorts is confounded by these factors.

Regarding the PK of pharmacologically inactive, tazobactam metabolite (M1), the terminal elimination phase extended beyond the accepted 6-hour sampling window. Furthermore, 2 subjects from Group 2 were given piperacillin/ tazobactam just over 24 hours prior to enrolment to the study and had predose  M1  concentrations.  Both  factors  are  associated  with  the  longer  half-life  of  M1  and  as  such, precluded  robust  PK  assessment  of  this  metabolite.  Although  the  timing  of  piperacillin/  tazobactam administration (&gt;24 hours before enrolment) in these two patients did not meet the study's exclusion criteria per se, the pre-dose M1 results suggest that a longer exclusion period between administration of tazobactam containing antibiotics and the study drug might have been more appropriate. However, no pre-dose tazobactam levels were detected in these subjects to suggest that the timing of previous piperacillin/ tazobactam administration also affected the PK analyses of tazobactam.

## Conclusion:

These  data  demonstrate  an  approximate  dose  proportional  increase  in  PK  of  tazobactam  and ceftolozane when doses were adjusted after interim analyses. There is also an observed increase in the CL and Vss for both antibiotics with increasing age.  With regards to the youngest age groups, the observed  decrease  in  clearance  for  both  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  was  expected  given  the immaturity of the renal system in this cohort and given that both products are cleared by the kidney.

This  study  provides  preliminary  data  on  the  single  dose  PK  profile  of  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  in children and will be used to inform the paediatric dosing strategy in the planned (pivotal) paediatric studies. Whilst it is acknowledged that there are some limitations of these data, they are sufficient to support further paediatric development of this product. Therefore, the MAH's overall conclusions are acceptable.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Ceftolozane/tazobactam has a favourable benefit-risk profile based on well-characterized efficacy and safety  data  in  adult  patients.  Single  doses  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  have  now  been  studied  in paediatric subjects from birth (7 days postnatal) to &lt;18 years receiving concurrent standard of care antibiotic  therapy  for  treatment  of  proven  or  suspected  gram-negative  infection  or  perioperative prophylaxis.  Study  CXA-PEDS-13-08  (P010)  evaluated  the  PK  and  safety  of  single  doses  of  IV ceftolozane/tazobactam to determine appropriate paediatric dosing that achieves the efficacious and safe exposure levels observed in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From this completed Phase I study no assessment or conclusion regarding the efficacy of ceftolozane/ tazobactam in the paediatric population can be made.

Ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  PK  parameters  after  a  single  dose  were  generally  comparable  across Groups  1-4  (ages  3  months  to  &lt;18  years).  Subjects  in  Groups  5  and  6  had  lower  CL  than  older subjects, and this is likely due to the immature renal function of the younger subjects. In paediatric patients aged ≤32 weeks gestation, 7 days postnatal to &lt;3 months (Group 6), those who received 12/6  mg/kg  ceftolozane/tazobactam  had  the  lowest  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  CL  amongst  all subjects in the trial, which is consistent with the lower CrCL in this age group. The MAH notes that the initial dose selection for each age group and dose changes as determined by interim analyses mitigated the effect of decreased CL on exposure. Thus, once dose adjustments were made for Groups 3 and 4, exposures were generally comparable across all age groups.

A single dose of IV ceftolozane/tazobactam in paediatric subjects from birth (7 days postnatal) to &lt;18 years of age was well tolerated. Overall, the reported adverse events (AE) were consistent with the trial population of hospitalized paediatric subjects with gram-negative infections. There were no deaths and no SAEs related to the study drug. In addition, no severe TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study drug or study  discontinuation  were  reported.  No  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities  or  changes  in ECGs were observed after administration of study drug, and no safety concerns were identified with administration  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  to  paediatric  subjects  in  this  trial.  The  adverse  effects observed  were  in  keeping  with  those  described  in  adults.  Thus,  the  MAH  concludes  no  new  safety concerns were identified. These conclusions are endorsed.

The MAH states that data from this study have been included in modelling and simulation studies to inform the dosing strategy for the planned treatment studies for cIAI and cUTI in paediatric subjects. Therefore, the results of this study support continued development of ceftolozane/ tazobactam in the paediatric population. This is acceptable.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

This  study  provides  preliminary  PK  and  safety  data  based  on  single-dose  ceftolozane/  tazobactam administration in children. Although there are some limitations with these data, they are adequate to support  further paediatric development  of  this  product. However,  at  this stage  of paediatric development, these data do not fully determine the benefit: risk in the paediatric population.

## Fulfilled:

No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a variation prior any conclusion  on  product  information  amendments  is  made.  The  MAH  should  commit  to  submit  this variation application by 12/21.
