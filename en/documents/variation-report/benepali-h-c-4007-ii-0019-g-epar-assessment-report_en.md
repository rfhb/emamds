## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

The MAH is submitting as part of this application two type II variations (Category C.l.2.b) to apply for Benepali to be registered for two paediatric indications already approved for the reference product Enbrel: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Paediatric plaque psoriasis.

The MAH proposes to group the two submitted variations since the variation type and justification for claiming for extrapolation of both indications are the same. Adding to that, the mechanism of action of etanercept regarding the proposed indications (JIA and paediatric psoriasis) is TNF-a binding, which shares the same mechanism as to the approved indications of Benepali such as RA and psoriasis.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Biosimilarity has been demonstrated on non-clinical level with the initial marketing authorisation of Benepali. Extrapolation of these data to the newly applied indications is considered adequate to support this application from a non-clinical point of view.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

This application is considered acceptable from a non-clinical perspective.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Pharmacokinetics

No new pharmacokinetic data was submitted.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic data was submitted.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetic equivalence, between the biosimilar product and innovator was demonstrated at the time of the initial MA. This data can be extrapolated from adult studies to the paediatric target population regarding the applied two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Comparative Pharmacokinetics of Benepali to the reference product in healthy volunteers was demonstrated with the initial MAA, supported by pharmacokinetic measurements in a subset of RA patients.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

No new clinical studies were submitted.

## 2.4.1. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The newly applied indications are already approved for the reference product Enbrel.

This application relies on the data submitted for the reference product Enbrel in the proposed indications. According to the EMA guideline on 'Similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues', extrapolation from one disease model to other indications may be accepted based on the totality of the data i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical evidence.

Biosimilarity to Enbrel has already been demonstrated at the time of the initial MA.

Sufficient knowledge of pharmacodynamics properties of Enbrel, including binding to its target receptor(s) and intrinsic activity demonstrate the same mechanism of action across all the indications.

Therefore safety and efficacy results from the studies presented at the initial MAA are sufficient for extrapolation to the applied paediatric indications, already approved for the references product.

Dosing in both pediatric indications is based on body weight. As Benepali, in contrast to Enbrel, is only available as a 50 mg single dose, the presentation is applicable only for pediatric patients with body weight equal or greater than 62.5 kg. A wording has been included in the PI, in section 4.2, stating that other etanercept products are available for pediatric patients that require less than a full 50 mg dose.

## 2.4.2. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

This application is considered acceptable from a clinical point of view.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

No new safety data was submitted.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The main safety issues for TNF-α inhibitors, including etanercept, are related with their immunosuppressive action. Long-term inhibition of TNF-α could lead to a serious impairment of defence mechanisms against infections (in particular opportunistic infections) and against the development of neoplasms.

With the initial marketing authorisation, safety / tolerability of Benepali has been compared against the safety / tolerability profile of Enbrel: Key safety information is derived from the clinical Phase III study SB4-G31-RA in RA patients as an appropriate study population for showing biosimilarity, supported by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical Phase I study SB4-G11-NHV in healthy subjects. Overall, there was no apparent and meaningful difference in safety and tolerability in the clinical studies.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

This application is considered acceptable from a safety point of view.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.2 is acceptable.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.2 with the following content:

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of the new indications in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in paediatric plaque psoriasis, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. Annex II, the Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance.

Dosing in both pediatric indications is based on body weight. As Benepali, in contrast to Enbrel, is only available as a 50 mg single dose, the presentation is applicable only for pediatric patients with body weight equal or greater than 62.5 kg. A wording has been included in the PI, in section 4.2, stating that other etanercept products are available for pediatric patients that require less than a full 50 mg dose.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns an extension of indication to include two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis, already approved for the reference medicinal product (Enbrel) for Benepali.

The reference medicinal product may have more than one therapeutic indication. When biosimilar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comparability has been demonstrated in one indication, extrapolation of clinical data to other indications of the reference product is possible . Extrapolation should be considered in the light of the totality of data, i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical data. It is expected that the safety and efficacy can be extrapolated when biosimilar comparability has been demonstrated by thorough physico-chemical and structural analyses as well as by in vitro functional tests complemented with clinical data (efficacy and safety and/or PK/PD data) in one therapeutic indication.

No new clinical studies were submitted in this application. Biosimilarity of Benepali to Enbrel has been demonstrated on physiochemical, biological, non-clinical and clinical grounds with the initial marketing authorisation in January 2016. Knowledge of pharmacodynamic properties of Enbrel, including binding to its target receptor(s) and intrinsic activity demonstrate the same mechanism of action across all the indications.

Results from the data presented at the initial MAA are sufficient for extrapolation to the applied paediatric indications, already approved for the references product.

The benefit-risk balance for the newly proposed indications of Benepali is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variations accepted   | Variations accepted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.2.b               | C.I.2.b - Change in the SPC, Labelling or PL of a generic/hybrid/biosimilar products following assessment of the same change for the reference product - Change(s) require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |
| C.I.2.b               | C.I.2.b - Change in the SPC, Labelling or PL of a generic/hybrid/biosimilar products following assessment of the same change for the reference product - Change(s) require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH | Type II | I, II and IIIB       |

Extension of indication to include two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis already approved for the reference medicinal product (Enbrel) for Benepali. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Annex II and the Package Leaflet are updated in accordance. The RMP (version 4.2) is also updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## · Risk management plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the same time.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## · Additional risk minimisation measures

1. Prior to launch in each Member State, the MAH shall agree the final educational material with the competent authority in that Member State, consisting of information provided to all healthcare professionals expected to prescribe the product on the correct and safe use of the pre-filled pen/pre-filled syringes and to inform them that the product is not for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg, and a Patient Alert Card which is to be given to patients using Benepali.

2. The healthcare professional's educational material should contain the following key elements:
- Teaching guide to facilitate training of the patients in the safe use of the pre-filled pen/prefilled syringes
- A needle-free demonstration device
- Material to remind healthcare professionals that Benepali is not for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg
- Instructional materials to share with patients.
3. The Patient Alert Card should contain the following key elements for patients treated with Benepali:
- The risk of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis (TB)
- The risk of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
- Benepali is not for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of indication to include two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis already approved for the reference medicinal product (Enbrel) for Benepali. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Annex II and the Package Leaflet are updated in accordance. The RMP (version 4.2) is also updated accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
