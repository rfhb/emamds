## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Voranigo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of predominantly non-enhancing Grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with an IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg who only had surgical intervention and are not in immediate need of radiotherapy or chemotherapy (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer medicinal products.

Before taking Voranigo, patients must have confirmation of an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) R132 or isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) R172 mutation using an appropriate diagnostic test. The presence of an IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation should be asessed by a CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with the corresponding intended purpose. If the CE-marked IVD is not available, IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation should be assessed by an alternative validated test.

## Posology

The recommended dose of Voranigo in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older is 40 mg once daily for patients weighing at least 40 kg. No dose recommendation can be made in patients weighing less than 40 kg because of the lack of clinical data in this population.

Treatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient.

## Missed or delayed doses

If a dose is missed or not taken at the usual time, it should be taken as soon as possible within 6 hours after the missed dose. The next dose should be taken at the regularly scheduled time.

If a dose is missed by more than 6 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the regularly scheduled time.

If a dose is vomited, replacement tablets should not be taken. The tablets should be taken as usual the following day.

## Precautions to be taken prior to administration and monitoring

Complete blood counts and blood chemistries, including liver enzymes, should be assessed prior to starting treatment, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months and then once monthly for the first 2 years of treatment, and as clinically indicated thereafter. Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing monitoring (see section 4.4).

## Dose modifications for adverse reactions

Dose interruption or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. The recommended dose reduction levels are provided in Table 1.

Table 1: Recommended dose reduction levels

| Dose level            | Dose and schedule   | Number and strength of tablets   |

b If an alternative aetiology is identified, consider resuming Voranigo at reduced dose (see Table 1) following resolution to Grade 1 or baseline.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

No starting dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). The pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib and metabolite AGI-69460 have not been studied in patients with eGFR ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Vorasidenib should not be used in patients with eGFR ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or who require dialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No starting dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh class A or B) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib and AGI-69460 have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Vorasidenib should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment and this patient population should be closely monitored.  (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

No clinical data are available in children aged 12 years to &lt; 18 years (see section 5.1).

## Method of administration

## Voranigo is for oral use.

The tablets should be taken once daily at about the same time each day. Patients should not eat food at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking Voranigo (see section 5.2). The tablets are to be swallowed whole with a glass of water and should not be split, crushed or chewed as no data are available to confirm similar bioavailability of the drug product when tablet manipulations are applied.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hepatotoxicity

Elevations in liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), with elevation in total bilirubin &gt; 2 times the ULN have been reported in patients treated with vorasidenib (see section 4.8). Hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis were observed in one patient treated with vorasidenib and autoimmune hepatitis was observed in one patient treated with vorasidenib.

Liver enzymes (including ALT, AST and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) and total bilirubin must be monitored prior to starting treatment, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment and then once monthly for the first 2 years of treatment, and as clinically indicated thereafter. Consider weekly monitoring for ALT or AST elevations ≤ 3 times the ULN. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue treatment based on the severity of the liver enzyme abnormalities (see section 4.2).

## Carcinogenicity risk

Animal findings may be suggestive of potential carcinogenic risk (notably in liver, see section 5.3). Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted yet and long-term clinical safety data are insufficient. Therefore, a carcinogenicity risk in humans could not be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception

Vorasidenib could cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy testing is recommended in women of childbearing potential prior to starting treatment. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose. Women who are planning to conceive a child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling.

Vorasidenib may decrease concentrations of hormonal contraceptives and, therefore, concomitant use of a barrier method of contraception is recommended during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).

## Male patients

Males with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose. Men should seek advice on cryo-preservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6).

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of vorasidenib have not been established in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes C) . Vorasidenib should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) and this patient population should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics and safety of vorasidenib have not been studied in patients with renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Vorasidenib should not be used in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Lactose

Voranigo contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Based on in vitro experiments vorasidenib is a strong inducer by means of pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation and may affect the plasma exposure of co-administered medicines that are metabolised or transported by enzymes or transporters whose expression is mediated by PXR.

## Effect of other medicinal products on vorasidenib

## Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors

Co-administration of vorasidenib with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin) may increase vorasidenib plasma concentration. Concomitant use of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided and consider alternative therapies that are not strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 during treatment with vorasidenib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In an in vivo drug-drug interaction study, co-administration of 20 mg vorasidenib with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor (500 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily for 14 days) increased vorasidenib maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 29% and area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) by 153%.

## Moderate CYP1A2 inducers

Co-administration of vorasidenib with moderate CYP1A2 inducers (phenytoin and rifampicin) may decrease vorasidenib plasma concentration. Consider alternative therapies that are not moderate CYP1A2 inducers during treatment with vorasidenib.

## Gastric acid reducing agents

No clinically significant differences in vorasidenib pharmacokinetics were observed following co-administration of vorasidenib with the gastric acid reducing agent omeprazole.

## Effect of vorasidenib on other medicinal products

## Cytochrome P450 (CYP) substrates with narrow therapeutic index

Co-administration of vorasidenib with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to, amitriptyline, alfentanil, carbamazepine, ciclosporin, dosulepin, everolimus, fentanyl, fosphenytoin, ifosfamide, imipramine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, tamoxifen, trimipramine, valproic acid, and warfarin) may decrease the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Concomitant use of substrates of these enzymes with narrow therapeutic index should be avoided in patients taking vorasidenib.

## Sensitive substrates of CYP enzymes without narrow therapeutic index

Co-administration of vorasidenib with sensitive substrates of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4 without narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to, bupropion, buspirone, celecoxib, darunavir, ibrutinib, midazolam, repaglinide, saquinavir, tipranavir, and triazolam) may decrease the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Consider alternative therapies that are not sensitive substrates of these enzymes during treatment with vorasidenib.

## Interactions with transporters

In vitro , vorasidenib is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (see section 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering vorasidenib with BCRP substrates (including, but not limited to, rosuvastatin).

## Hormonal contraceptives

Vorasidenib may decrease concentrations of hormonal contraceptives and, therefore, concomitant use of a barrier method of contraception is recommended during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception

Pregnancy testing is recommended in women of childbearing potential prior to starting treatment with vorasidenib (see section 4.4).

Women of childbearing potential and males with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose. Since the effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of vorasidenib on the metabolism and efficacy of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier methods should be applied as a second form of contraception to avoid pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of vorasidenib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal development toxicity (see section 5.3).

Vorasidenib should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Women of childbearing potential or male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should be advised on the potential risk to a foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether vorasidenib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least 2 months after the last dose.

## Fertility

There are no human data on the effect of vorasidenib on fertility. Findings on reproductive organs were observed during repeat-dose toxicity studies in female and male animals (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these effects is unknown. Male and female patients who are planning to conceive a child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling, and men should seek advice on cryo-preservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.4).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Vorasidenib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were ALT increased (59.3%), AST increased (45.5%), GGT increased (37.7%), fatigue (36.5%) and diarrhoea (24.6%).

The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were ALT increased (9.6%), AST increased (4.2%) and GGT increased (3.0%).

Serious adverse reactions of ALT increased occurred in 0.6% of patients who received Voranigo.

Permanent discontinuation of vorasidenib due to grade ≥ 3 ALT increased was reported in 3.0% of patients.

Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 18.6% of patients treated with vorasidenib. The most common adverse reactions requiring dose interruption were ALT increased (14.4%) and AST increased (6.0%).

Dose reductions of vorasidenib due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9.6% of patients. The most common adverse reaction requiring dose reduction was ALT increased (7.8%).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hepatobiliary disorders

In Study AG881-C-004, of the 167 patients treated with vorasidenib, 18.6% experienced elevations in ALT &gt; 3 times the ULN and 8.4% experienced elevations in AST &gt; 3 times the ULN. Among these patients, 1.2% had concurrent elevations in ALT or AST &gt; 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 times the  ULN. Liver enzyme and bilirubin increases were transient and improved or resolved with dose modification or permanent discontinuation of treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis were observed in one patient treated with vorasidenib and autoimmune hepatitis was observed in one patient treated with vorasidenib (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the event of overdose, toxicity is likely to manifest as exacerbation of the adverse reactions associated with vorasidenib (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored and provided with appropriate supportive care (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). There is no specific antidote for vorasidenib overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; other antineoplastic agents ATC code: L01XM04

## Mechanism of action

Vorasidenib is an inhibitor that targets the mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes. In patients with astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations lead to overproduction of the oncogenic metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), resulting in impaired cellular differentiation contributing to oncogenesis. Inhibition of the IDH1- and IDH2-mutated proteins by vorasidenib inhibits the abnormal production of 2-HG leading to differentiation of malignant cells and a reduction in their proliferation. Pre-clinical studies investigating the ability of vorasidenib to decrease tumour size were not performed.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

A therapeutic daily dose of vorasidenib was observed to decrease 2-HG tumour concentrations in subjects with IDH1 or IDH2 mutated glioma.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of vorasidenib were evaluated in the INDIGO trial, a phase 3, randomised (1:1), multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 331 adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years old weighing ≥ 40 kg. Eligible patients were required to have Grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma as defined by 2016 WHO criteria with an IDH1 R132 mutation or IDH2 R172 mutation, had surgery including biopsy, sub-total resection, or gross-total resection as their only treatment and were not in immediate need of chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the opinion of the investigator. Patients who had MRI-evaluable, measurable, non-enhancing disease, as confirmed by the blinded independent review committee (BIRC) were enrolled. Patients with centrally-confirmed enhancing disease were permitted to enrol provided that the enhancement was minimal, non-nodular, non-measurable and had not changed between the 2 most recent scans. The INDIGO trial excluded patients who received prior anti-cancer treatment, including chemotherapy or radiation therapy. IDH1 or IDH2 mutation status was prospectively determined using the Oncomine Dx Target Test.

Patients were randomised to receive either vorasidenib 40 mg orally once daily or matched placebo until radiographic disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by local 1p19q status (co-deleted or not co-deleted) and baseline tumour size (diameter ≥ 2 cm or &lt; 2 cm). Patients who were randomised to placebo were allowed to cross over to receive vorasidenib after documented radiographic disease progression provided that they were not in need of immediate chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the opinion of the investigator.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluated by a BIRC according to modified response assessment in neuro-oncology for low grade glioma (RANO-LGG) criteria (radiographic progression only).

Patient demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. Among the 168 patients randomised to vorasidenib, the median age was 41 years (range: 21 to 71 years), with 98.8% aged 18-64 years. A single paediatric patient aged 16 years was randomised to placebo, and no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient under the age of 18 was randomised to vorasidenib. A majority of patients were male (60.1%), 74.4% were White, 3.0% Asian, 1.2% Black, 1.2% other, 19.6% not reported and 53.6% had a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of 100, 45.8% had a KPS score of 90-80, and 0.6% had a KPS score of 70-60. Most patients had at least 1 prior surgery for glioma (75%) and 25% had ≥ 2 prior surgeries. Across both arms, 95% of patients had an IDH1 R132 mutation and 5% had an IDH2 R172 mutation.

Efficacy results for PFS are summarised in Table 4 and Figure 1.

An updated PFS by BIRC analysis, carried out at 96% (N = 158) of events, confirmed the benefit of vorasidenib compared to placebo (hazard ratio: 0.35 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.49]). At 24 months, the progression-free survival rate was 59% (95% CI: 48.4, 67.8) in the vorasidenib arm and 26% (95% CI: 17.9, 35.3) in the placebo arm. The median PFS was not estimable (95% CI: 22.1, NE) for the vorasidenib arm and was 11.4 (95% CI: 11.1, 13.9) months for the placebo arm.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adolescents from 12 to less than 18 years of age

Use of vorasidenib in patients aged 12 years to less than 18 years with IDH1 or IDH2 mutant astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma is supported by pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that age had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib (see section 5.2).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib have been characterised in patients with low-grade glioma with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation and in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetic profile of vorasidenib is similar between patients with low-grade glioma and healthy subjects.

## Absorption

After a single 40 mg oral dose, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) for vorasidenib was 2.0 hours, the geometric mean Cmax was 75.4 ng/mL (CV%: 44), and the geometric mean AUC was 2,860 hr*ng/mL (CV%: 56). At steady-state, vorasidenib geometric mean Cmax was 133 ng/mL (CV%: 73) and geometric mean AUC was 1,988 hr*ng/mL (CV%: 95). In most patients, a second plasma concentration peak occurred within 24 hours after drug administration but was lower than the observed Cmax at 2 hours post-dose. Although absolute bioavailability has not been directly determined, the absorption of vorasidenib is estimated to be moderate to high for the 40 mg film-coated tablets.

Accumulation ratios were approximately 3.8 for Cmax and 4.4 for AUC. Steady-state plasma levels were reached after 2 to 3 weeks of once-daily dosing.

The mean Cmax and AUC of vorasidenib increased by 3.1-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively, when vorasidenib was administered with a high-fat meal. Administration of vorasidenib with a low-fat meal resulted in increases in vorasidenib Cmax and AUC of 2.3- and 1.4-fold, respectively (see section 4.2).

## Distribution

Vorasidenib has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 3,930 L (CV%: 40). The vorasidenib volume of distribution following a single 0.1 mg IV microdose is 1,110 L. The bound plasma protein fraction for vorasidenib and AGI-69460 was 97% and 87%, respectively. Both vorasidenib and AGI-69460 exhibit preferential binding to serum albumin over alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Vorasidenib blood to plasma ratio is 0.87, AGI-69460 blood to plasma ratio is 1.38, and vorasidenib brain tumour to plasma concentration ratio is 1.6.

## Biotransformation

Vorasidenib is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 with negligible to minor contributions from CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. Non-CYP pathways may contribute up to 30% of vorasidenib liver metabolic clearance.

AGI-69460 is a downstream active metabolite of vorasidenib. After a single 40 mg vorasidenib oral dose, the observed Tmax for metabolite AGI-69460 was 336 hours, the observed geometric mean Cmax was 3.32 ng/mL (CV%: 55.6), and the geometric mean AUC0-t was 1,172 hr*ng/mL (CV%: 61). At steady-state, geometric mean AGI-69460 Cmin,ss was 111 ng/mL (CV%: 58) and geometric mean AUC0-4 at cycle 2 day 1 was 190 hr*ng/mL (CV%: 90).

## Interactions

In vitro , vorasidenib has a strong induction effect on sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and a moderate induction effect on sensitive CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro data indicate that vorasidenib is an inhibitor of BCRP. Vorasidenib does not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and hepatic transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. In vitro , AGI-69460 is an inhibitor of BCRP and OATP1B3.

Vorasidenib is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, or hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.

## Elimination

Approximately 89% of the administered vorasidenib radioactive dose, using a powder-in-capsule formulation with an absolute bioavailability of &lt; 34%, was recovered over 44 days, with 85% in faeces and 4.5% in urine. Most of the administered radioactivity that was recovered in faeces was unchanged vorasidenib (55%) while no unchanged vorasidenib was detected in urine.

The mean terminal half-life of vorasidenib is 238 hours (CV%: 57), the effective half-life is 63.2 hours (CV%: 75) and the mean apparent clearance is 14.0 L/h (CV%: 56).

## Linearity/non-linearity

Following administration of Voranigo, vorasidenib Cmax and AUC increases in a proportional manner between 10 and 40 mg.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib were observed in older patients up to 75 years (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

Renal impairment (eGFR &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib. The pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib in patients with eGFR ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or renal impairment requiring dialysis are unknown.

## Hepatic impairment

Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) had no clinically significant effects on vorasidenib and AGI-69460 pharmacokinetics. There were no clinically relevant changes in total or free (unbound) vorasidenib concentrations (similar vorasidenib Cmax values and an increase of 26.0% in vorasidenib AUC0-t were observed, while decreased AGI-69460 exposure was observed) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment following a single oral dose of 20 mg vorasidenib. The pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib and AGI-69460 in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) are unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Other

No clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib were observed based on age (16 to 75 years), race, ethnicity and body weight (43.5 to 168 kg). Female patients were observed to have a 1.6-fold higher vorasidenib exposure as compared to male patients.

## Paediatric population

Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that age had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of vorasidenib. The exposure of vorasidenib is expected to be similar between adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main target toxicities identified during repeat-dose toxicity studies concern liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin, kidney, skeletal muscle, reproductive organs and mammary gland.

Vorasidenib was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, in vitro human lymphocyte micronucleus and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. AGI-69460, its major circulating metabolite, was not genotoxic in the Ames assay, the in vitro human lymphocyte micronucleus assay, and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus and Comet assays.

In the 13-week study in monkeys, Kupffer cell hyperplasia were observed at primary necropsy and worsened after recovery period at 8-fold the clinical exposure. In addition, findings from rat toxicity studies suggested hormonal perturbation. Such findings may be suggestive of potential carcinogenic risk. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted yet with vorasidenib.

Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with vorasidenib. Effects on reproductive organs were noted during repeat-dose toxicity studies after administration of vorasidenib in rats. Adverse effects in female reproductive organs included atrophy of the ovaries, uterus, cervix and vagina and oestrous cycle variations. In male rats, effects were noted on the epididymis (cellular debris), seminal vesicle/prostate (atrophy), and testis (weights, tubular degeneration). These findings were observed at the lowest tested dose of 5 mg/kg/day in the 13-week rat study, resulting in an exposure level 26-fold higher than the human exposure at 50 mg daily dose.

Vorasidenib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits (higher incidence of resorptions, delayed ossification, visceral malformations for kidney and testes in rats). These effects occurred at doses that were higher compared to patients receiving the therapeutic daily dose. The exposure ratios at the NOAEL for embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits were 8.0 to 28.5 and 1.1 to 4.9, respectively, on gestation days 6 and 17 for rat and 6 and 19 for rabbit.

## 1. What Voranigo is and what it is used for

## What Voranigo is and how it works

Voranigo is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance vorasidenib.

It is used as treatment for cancers of the brain called astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 40 kg, who have had surgery as their only treatment and who do not need other treatments such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy immediately.

This medicine is only used when the cancer cells have changes in the genes (mutations) that make proteins known as IDH1 and IDH2. The doctor will have a test performed to check if the cells have this mutation before treatment starts. The IDH1 and IDH2 proteins play an important role in making energy for cells and when the IDH1 gene or IDH2 gene is mutated, these proteins are changed and do not function properly. This results in changes in the cells that can lead to the development of cancer.

The active substance in Voranigo, vorasidenib, blocks the abnormal IDH1 and IDH2 proteins. In patients with astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma brain cancers, these proteins are not working properly, causing the overproduction of a substance called 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that plays a part in the process of normal cells turning into cancer cells. By blocking these proteins, vorasidenib stops the abnormal production of 2-HG which helps to slow or stop the cancer from growing.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Voranigo

## Do not take Voranigo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- if you are allergic to vorasidenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

## Monitoring of liver function

Voranigo may affect how well your liver functions. Your doctor will carry out blood tests to check how well your liver is working before you are treated with Voranigo, and as necessary during the treatment. If necessary, your doctor may lower your dose or temporarily or permanently stop your treatment.

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse right away if you develop any of the following, which may be signs and symptoms of liver problems:

- yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice)
- dark 'tea-coloured' urine
- loss of appetite
- pain on the upper right side of your stomach area
- feeling weak or very tired

## Pregnancy and birth control
