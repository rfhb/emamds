## 1. INTRODUCTION

This  AR  concerns  a  study  which  was  submitted  by  the  MAH  in  compliance  with  Article  46  of  the regulation 1901/2006.

Following the request from The Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Authority in Sri Lanka, this study was undertaken  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  oral  live  attenuated  HRV vaccine, Rotarix when administered to healthy infants aged from 6 weeks (first dose) to not more than 24 weeks (second dose). The interval between doses was to be not less than 4 weeks.

The MAH's experts stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Rotarix and that subsequently there are neither consequential regulatory actions nor changes to the product information necessary.

## 2. STUDY SUMMARIES

## Study 111664

##  General

Study 111664 was conceptualized as an open, multi-centric post-marketing surveillance (PMS) with the  intent  to  evaluate  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  two  doses  of  the  oral  live  attenuated  human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine, known under the trade-name Rotarix™, when administered according to a 0, 2 month schedule to Sri Lankan infants aged at least 6 weeks at the time of first vaccination.

##  Objective(s)

In order to attain the goal of the study as stated, the following objectives and matching endpoints were defined:

Primary:

- To assess the reactogenicity of Rotarix in terms of occurrence of at least one grade '2' or grade '3' fever, vomiting or diarrhoea within a 8-day follow-up period after each vaccine dose.

Endpoint: Occurrence of at least one grade '2' or grade '3' fever, vomiting or diarrhoea during the 8-day (Day 0 - Day 7) follow-up period after each vaccine dose.

Secondary:

-  To assess the reactogenicity of Rotarix in terms of occurrence of solicited adverse events (AEs) within a 8-day follow-up period after each vaccine dose.

Endpoint: For each type of solicited symptom, occurrence of the symptom within the 8-day (Day 0 - Day 7) follow-up period after each vaccine dose.

- To assess the safety of Rotarix in terms of occurrence of unsolicited AEs within a 31-day follow-up period after each vaccine dose.

Endpoint:  Occurrence  of  unsolicited  symptoms  during  the  31-day  (Day  0  -  Day  30)  follow-up period  after  each  vaccine  dose,  according  to  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) classification.

- To assess the safety of Rotarix in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period after Dose 1 of Rotarix.

Endpoint: Occurrence of SAEs throughout the study period following Dose 1.

##  Study design

The study design is summarized in figure 1 as follows:

Figure 1: Study design scheme

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

HRV vaccine: GSK Biologicals' Rotarix

N = number of subjects planned to be enrolled.

*Dose 1 was to be administered not later than 19 weeks of age

**Dose 2 to be administered before 24 weeks of age

The duration of the whole of the study was planned as approximately 3-4 months, on a per subject basis.  A  number  of  specific  solicited  AEs,  knowing  fever,  fussiness/irritability,  loss  of  appetite, cough/runny  nose,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting,  were  to  be  recorded  in  the  8-day  window  following administration (including the day of vaccination itself). Unsolicited AEs were to be recorded until Day 30 after each dose. SAEs were to be recorded at all times.

Planned between visit intervals are shown in table 1:

Table 1: Between-visit intervals

| Interval             | Length of interval   |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 (Visit 1→Visit 2）  | Notlessthan4weeks    |
| 2 (Visit 2→→Visit 3) | One to two months    |

Note: The date of the previous visit served as the reference date for intervals between study visits.

##  Study population /Sample size

The number of subjects to be included in the study was determined to be 550 subjects as per the regulatory  authority  requirements.  Evaluation  took  place  on  the  Total  vaccinated  Cohort  (TVC),  in other words on all vaccinated subjects for whom data was available.

Any male or female infant of at least 6 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination was eligible to participate,  unless  it  had  a  history  of  allergic  disease  or  reactions  likely  to  be  exacerbated  by  any component of the vaccine, if it was suffering from an acute disease at time of enrolment, if it had a history of uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for IS or if any other contraindication in the approved SPC was applicable to the subject in question.

##  Demography Results

Five hundred twenty two subjects were enrolled, with 96% of these receiving two doses of vaccine. There were no unexpected outliers on the demographic profiles of the participants.

The overall most frequently occurring solicited AE was fever, being reported for 18.0% and 20.2% of subjects following Dose 1 and Dose 2, respectively. The most reported grade 3 AE turned out to be vomiting,  which  was  observed  in  1.7%  and  1.0%  of  subjects  following  Dose  1  and  Dose  2  of  the vaccination respectively.

Fever  was  also  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  AE  with  a  causal  relationship  to  vaccination; reported for 18.0% and 20.2% of subjects following Dose 1 and Dose 2, respectively.

The percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited AE during the 31-day (Day 0 - Day 30) follow-up period was 4.8%, with constipation being the most commonly reported one at  1.5% of the subjects. The percentage of subjects reporting at least one grade '3' unsolicited AE stood at 0.6%, while unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination were reported for 1.0% of subjects (table 6).

During the study no fatal events occurred, and there was but one SAE reported, albeit leading to study discontinuation, which was considered as unlikely to be related to the vaccination.

In  total  8.8%  of  participants  started  taking  concomitant  medication  during  the  study,  of  which  the majority (5.7%) took anti-pyretics.

##  Conclusions:

- No safety concerns were raised on the available data.
- No fatal events and IS cases were reported in the study.
- One  subject  reported  a  SAE  that  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  have  a  causal relationship to vaccination.
- No cases of IS (bowel intussusception), Kawasaki disease or Pneumonia have been reported in this study.
- Two doses of GSK Biologicals' Rotarix vaccine was well tolerated and had a good safety profile in the local paediatric population

## 3. ASSESSOR'S CONCLUSIONS ON CLINICAL ASPECTS

- The open study 111664 aimed to investigate the tolerability and safety of the HRV vaccine in young  children  in  the  Sri  Lankan  community,  when  administered  according  to  the  local vaccination schedule.
- During the course of the investigation no unexpected safety results were encountered, and the number and types of AEs (including SAEs), whether solicited  or  not,  reported  were  entirely within the range of expected issues of this vaccine.

No new issues that would warrant regulatory actions were found to exist in any of the study results provided, and results were in agreement with the already established knowledge on Rotarix safety and immunogenicity.

This submission is thus hereby considered to be fulfilled.
