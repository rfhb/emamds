The mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. Based on historical comparison, amprenavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by paroxetine, suggesting no impact of paroxetine on amprenavir and ritonavir exposure. Therefore, if paroxetine is co-administered with amprenavir and ritonavir, the recommended approach is a dose titration of paroxetine based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response. In addition, patients on stable dose of paroxetine who start treatment with amprenavir and ritonavir should be monitored for antidepressant response. |
| II/0042 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the SPC to add a statement on monitoring and management of hyperglycemia and lipid (cholesterol/triglyceride) elevations based on data from the French Hospital HIV cohort and to change frequency category of the adverse drug reaction 'hypercholesterolaemia' based on postmarketing data. Section 4 of the PL was | product 22/10/2009  | 20/11/2009                               | SPC, PL                          | Postmarketing data have shown that treatment with fosamprenavir (FPV) (the pro-drug of amprenavir) resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol. Physicians should therefore be recommended to perform triglyceride and cholesterol testing prior to initiating therapy with amprenavir and at periodic intervals during therapy. The precautionary statement regarding the monitoring of hyperglycaemia was brought in line with this wording. Blood glucose testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with amprenavir and at periodic intervals during therapy. Based on the results of two 2 postmarketing studies (ESS100732 and APV109141) the frequency category of the adverse drug reaction 'hypercholesterolemia' was                                                                                                               |

| II/0040 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Update of section 4.3 and section 4.5 of the SPC to implement the class labelling text agreed by the CHMP in May 2008 on the combination of rifampicin with amprenavir given with concomitant low-dose ritonavir. | 25/09/2008          | 28/10/2008                               | SPC                              | longer In 2005 an interaction study on saquinavir boosted with ritonavir together with rifampicin in healthy volunteers had to be prematurely discontinued due to an increased risk of hepatotoxicity associated with this co-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not fully elucidated. It has been hypothesised that the predominant effect between the inducer effect of rifampicin and the inhibitor effect of the boosted protease inhibitors might depend on the boosted protease inhibitor involved. Lacking the results of specific interaction studies, the CHMP concluded as a conservative measure to reinforce the contraindication with rifampicin in section 4.4 and improve the guidance provided to physicians regarding the interaction of boosted protease inhibitors with rifampicin in section 4.5.                                              |

No differences were observed between the resistance mutations selected by boosted and unboosted fosamprenavir and the analysis of the virological failure samples defined four main resistance pathways in ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients. Similar resistance patterns were observed in the paediatric patients compared with the adults. It is noted that amprenavir is not approved for use in ART-naïve or PI-naïve patients. The wording on PI experienced patients was also updated; certain mutations were deleted as they were not present or not treatment emergent (i.e., were already present initially before treatment). |

| II/0036   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.8 of the SPC further to a review of angioedema cases carried out by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to include the adverse reaction angioedema. Consequently, the PL is updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 13/12/2007         | 28/01/2008    | SPC, PL           | authorised Amprenavir (APV) contains a sulphonamide moiety. Published literature acknowledges that sulphonamides have been associated with allergic reactions. Angioedema is often a feature of allergic reactions. As of 20 April 2007, 58 reports (3.6 %of all APV reports) were retrieved from the MAH's worldwide safety database. Fifty-four reports were excluded from review. The remaining four reports were reviewed and assessed. They did not provide strong evidence of a causal association - despite three cases showing a compatible time to onset with APV (30 minutes, same day, 4 days) - since important information on concurrent antiretrovirals was missing or an infectious cause could not be ruled out. However, based on evidence from clinical trials, angioedema can be associated with APV with the frequency category \"uncommon\".   |

| II/0033   | Medicinal Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet Update of section 5.1 of the SPC to remove information related to protease inhibitors (PI)- naïve patients and to improve the current information on pre-treated children and on PI- experienced adults. Consequently, section 4.1 of the SPC for Agenerase oral solution was amended. Annex IIB was updated in line with the current submission cycle for Agenerase PSURs (3- yearly basis). | product 19/07/2007 | 30/08/2007    | SPC, Annex II, PL | The clinical information on Agenerase SPC has been reviewed to better reflect the current use of amprenavir. Therefore, information on the use of Agenerase in protease inhibitor (PI)-naïve patients has been removed from the SPC as Agenerase is indicated in PI-experienced patients only. Furthermore, currently amprenavir (as Agenerase) is no longer recommended in clinical guidelines as part of HAART, so there was no clinical relevance to have information on PI-naïve patients in the SPC. The information on pre-treated children and on PI-experienced patients presented in the SPC has been improved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| II/0034   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of SPC and section 2 of the PL as regards the interaction with oral and parenteral midazolam, following CHMP request in March 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 21/06/2007         | 25/07/2007    | SPC, PL   | authorised Based on available data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally than when it is injected. Therefore, the coadministration of Agenerase with orally administered midazolam is contraindicated, whereas caution should be used when Agenerase is co- administrated with an injection of midazolam. If Agenerase is co-administered with injectable midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL are updated with this information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| II/0028   | Medicinal Update of Summary of Product Characteristics To update section 5.1 of the SPC to provide recommendations with regards to the mutation predictive of virological response to amprenavir/ritonavir and to review available in vitro resistance data and assess the possibility of cross-resistance to newly licensed protease inhibitors (PI) such as lopinavir, atazanavir and tipranavir. This follows the CHMP's requests dated 21 September 2005 and 16 March 2006, respectively, further to the assessment of the renewal dossier for amprenavir, follow-up measure 019 for fosamprenavir as well as current clinical guidance on resistance. | product 22/02/2007 | no 28/02/2007 | SPC       | longer During studies in PI-naïve patients treated with unboosted amprenavir (phase II studies PRO2001 and PRO2002 and Phase III pivotal studies PRO3001 and PRO3006 ), PI-mutations were identified. Although no resistance data is available for boosted amprenavir in PI naïve patients, in study PRO30017 (PI-experienced patients) mutations emerged in patients with virological failure. No clinical data is available for PI- naïve patients treated with boosted amprenavir as oral solution. HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected during in vitro serial passage experiments. Reduced susceptibility to amprenavir was associated with virus that had developed I50V or I84V or V32I+I47V or I54M mutations. Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir produces some cross-resistance to ritonavir but susceptibility to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally retained. There are currently insufficient data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors. Based on data from thirteen antiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen and on limited in vitro data (site directed mutagenesis) the resistance pathways associated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to lopinavir (clinical data available from thirteen isolates) while susceptibility to atazanavir (from four isolates) and tipranavir (from two isolates) is generally retained. Conversely amprenavir retains activity against some isolates with resistance to other PIs and this retained activity would depend on the number and type of protease resistance mutations present in the isolates |

| II/0030   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL to implement the class labelling text on osteonecrosis, agreed by the CHMP in September 2006.                                                                                                                    | 14/12/2006         | 24/01/2007    | SPC, PL   | authorised Cases of osteonecrosis (death of the bone tissue resulting from an insufficient blood supply) have been reported in HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although the cause of this disease could be due to multiple factors (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease and/or in patients with long term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all available data the CHMP agreed that this information should now be included in the SPC and PL of all antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| II/0029   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.5 of the SPC with the results of an interaction study comparing ketoconazole 200mg once daily and fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily in healthy volunteers. Section 6 of the PL was updated with the local representatives in Bulgaria and Romania. | product 16/11/2006 | no 08/01/2007 | SPC, PL   | longer A specific drug interaction study to further substantiate the recommendation of co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with ketoconazole was submitted as part of the follow-up commitments made at the time of the marketing authorisation for fosamprenavir (Telzir). Results of this study can be extrapolated to Agenerase, as fosamprenavir is a pro-drug that is completely converted to amprenavir during absorption. Results of the study showed that ketoconazole pharmacokinetic parameters (essentially area under the curve, AUC) are significantly increased when ketoconazole 200 mg once daily is co-administered with fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily boosted with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. These results confirm that fosamprenavir boosted leads to an increase of ketoconazole AUC, which is much higher (2.69 fold) than with amprenavir unboosted (0.44 fold). No significant impact of ketoconazole on amprenavir and ritonavir exposures was observed. Consequently, the updated recommended maximum daily dose of this co-administration is not more than 200 mg ketoconazole once daily when given together with an amprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice-daily regimen. |
| II/0026   | Medicinal Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Update of section 5.1 of the SPC to harmonise its sub-section on resistance with the SPC of fosamprenavir.

Furthermore, the implications of the mutation I50V on a possible cross-resistance to nelfinavir were discussed. However, based upon an analysis to examine the nelfinavir anticipated response in subjects with isolates containing I50V after Agenerase failure, the CHMP concluded that a response to a subsequent nelfinavir-containing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen since the opportunistic infection has not yet been detected/diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for the complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially, is the great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug interactions. In conclusion, in most cases, the clinical consequences of the awakening immune system in patients starting ART cannot be prevented. Therefore, early recognition and diagnosis of these inflammatory reactions are important in the clinical handling of the patient. The description and the guidelines for treatment of the numerous clinical conditions potentially arising in association with the reactivation of the immune system in HIV-infected patients are given in the textbooks of infectious diseases. However, as the clinical conditions associated with the reactivation of the immune system may constitute a threat to the patient, a reminder of the phenomenon is deemed of value and has been included in the SPC and PL of all antiretroviral medicinal products. |
