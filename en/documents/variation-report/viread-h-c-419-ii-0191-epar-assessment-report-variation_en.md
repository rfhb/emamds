## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

Recent reports estimate that 250 to 350 million individuals were living with HBV (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive) in 2010, representing a worldwide prevalence of 3.6%, with considerable geographic variability. In 2013, an estimated 686,000 deaths were due to HBV infection and associated complications, placing it among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide.

Universal HBV vaccination and blood-donor screening have markedly reduced the rate of chronic infection including in Europe. However, a significant number of children are still infected each year. In Europe, prevalence remains elevated in some European areas (notably in Eastern and Southern Europe) and paediatricians are confronted with an increasing number of children adopted from higher prevalence countries.

Following acute HBV infection, the risk of developing chronic infection varies inversely with age. Chronic HBV infection occurs among about 90% of infants infected at birth, 25 to 50% of children infected at 1 to 5 years of age, and about 5 to 10% of persons infected as teens and adults.

Although most children with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic and severe liver disease during childhood is rare, children are at risk for developing serious complications later in life, notably cirrhosis and HCC. In addition, HBV carriers can transmit the disease for many years.

Chronic HBV infection is characterised by different phases of infection:

1) the immune tolerant phase, with markedly elevated levels of HBV DNA, detectable HBsAg and HBV e antigen (HBeAg), and normal or low levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT);

2) the immune active phase, characterised by elevated levels of HBV DNA with persistently elevated ALT, an indicator of ongoing liver damage;

3) the inactive HBsAg carrier phase, with undetectable or low levels of HBV DNA and the presence of anti-HBe antibodies; and

4) the reactivation phase, characterised by HBeAg seronegativity (and anti-HBe seropositivity) but with elevated HBV DNA levels and abnormal ALT.

Management of CHB in children and adolescents is evolving and optimal treatment is not well established. The current consensus is that no treatment is indicated for HBV-infected children in the immune tolerant or inactive HBsAg carrier phases (AASLD 2018, EASL 2017). However, treatment may be warranted for children  in  the  immune  active  or  reactivation  phases  to  suppress  viral  replication  and  prevent complications and poor clinical outcomes, including cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and HCC. Indeed, studies in adults suggest that a prolonged period of time in the immune active phase is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC.

As mentioned in the ESPGHAN clinical practice guidelines (Sokal et al. J of Heatology 2013), for all patients, the ideal end point of treatment is sustained HBsAg clearance, as it stops disease progression and  reduces  the  risk  of  HCC,  although  it  occurs  in  a  minority  of  treated  subjects.  When  HBsAg seroclearance is not achieved, sustained off-therapy suppression of viral replication (undetectable HBV DNA levels with a sensitive real time polymerase chain reaction assay), associated with durable anti-HBe seroconversion in originally HBeAg-positive patients, is a good end point, being associated with improved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prognosis, including decreased risk of HCC. In the absence of off-therapy viral suppression, undetectable HBV DNA under long-term antiviral therapy (maintained virological response) is the next desirable end point. Reduction of viremia levels leads to decreased liver inflammation and subsequent normalisation of ALT levels, reducing the risk of disease progression.

Currently, there are two main treatment options for CHB patients: treatment with oral antiviral agents or with IFNa, currently pegylated interferon alfa-2a. The rationale for a PegIFNa based approach is to induce long-term  immunological  control  with  a  finite  duration  treatment  (EASL  2017);  however,  pegIFN  is associated with important safety and tolerability issues. Entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are potent inhibitors of HBV replication with a high barrier to resistance, and these 3 agents are recommended as preferred monotherapies for CHB in adults regardless of the severity of liver disease (EASL 2017).

Entecavir, TDF and TAF as well as peginterferon alfa-2a are currently approved for use in CHB-infected adolescents in Europe. In children, only entecavir is approved for paediatric patients (from 2 years of age) and Pegasys (from 3 years of age). A study is ongoing with TAF in paediatric patients &lt;12 y.o.

Thus, TDF represents a new treatment option for children 2 to &lt; 12 years old given its potent antiviral activity in CHB, including patients with resistance to other oral antivirals, such as LAM and ETV.

## 2.1. Introduction

Viread [tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)] is the oral prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase  inhibitor.  After  absorption,  TDF  is  rapidly  converted  to  TFV,  which  is  metabolised intracellularly to the active metabolite, TFV diphosphate, a potent and selective inhibitor of both hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase.

Viread is currently approved in the European Union for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adult and paediatric patients &gt; 12 years old and for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and paediatric patients &gt; 2 years.

The MAH is now submitting a type II variation to extend the indication of CHB-infected paediatric patients from 2 to 12 years of age. This application is supported by the submission of the 48 weeks results of study GS-US-174-0144. This study is an ongoing Phase 3 study that is evaluating safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) or TDF in paediatric subjects with CHB.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The environmental risk assessment for TDF has been updated to account for increased environmental exposure due to a paediatric line extension.

The MAH has already performed Phase I studies and Phase II studies (Tier A and Tier B) for the initial MAA in adult / children from 12 years in HBV. In section 5.3 of SmPC, it is noted that the active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Based on the updated data submitted in this application, no additional studies would be required for this extended indication.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Bioanalytical Methods

The concentration of TFV in plasma samples was determined using fully validated high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC/MS/MS)  bioanalytical  methods.  All  samples  were analysed within the time frame supported by frozen stability storage data. The assays for TFV were performed using validated methods by QPS, Inc (Newark, DE, USA).

Bioanalytical method validation parameters are summarised in the table below:

Table 6. GS-US-174-0144: Bioanalytical Assay Validation for Tenofovir in HumanPlasma

| Parameter                         | TFV           |

| Interassay precision range (%CV)  | 2.4% to 6.5%  |
| Interassay accuracy range (%RE)   | -4.7% to 2.0% |
| Stability in frozen matrix (days) |               |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioanalytic methods used in this study were the same than those used previously in adolescents' study.

The calibration standards and QCs of the in-study validation are considered acceptable by the CHMP.

With the exception of two samples (Subject 1021 Week 16 and Subject 1028 Week 4), all study samples were analysed within the established long-term stability of 1426 days at -80°C (please refer to QPS 42-0831 Amendment 6).

The reasons for re-analysis of the samples are also considered adequate by the CHMP (one sample was re-assayed due to no internal standard detected and one sample was re-assayed due to low internal standard).

Incurred sample reanalysis was not performed. This is considered suitable by the CHMP since the ISR was performed in the previous clinical trial.

## Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination

No  new  information  is  submitted  since  no  significant  difference  in  PK  characteristics  is  expected  in children as compared to adolescents or adults. This is endorsed by the CHMP.

## Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (2 to &lt;12 years old) with CHB

In order to characterise the PKs of TFV in paediatric CHB, the MAH developed a population-PK model using sparse  and  intensive  sampling  plasma  concentrations  collected  from  study  GS-US-174-0144.  The purpose of this modelling effort was to estimate the steady-state exposures of TFV in paediatric subjects who received TDF 8 mg/kg powder or tablet. The model-derived exposures were utilised to evaluate the PK and exposure-response (efficacy and safety) of TFV to support an expansion of the current indication to include paediatric subjects (2 to &lt;12 years old) with CHB.

## Population Pharmacokinetics for TFV

Population PK modelling was conducted to describe the plasma PK for TFV in paediatric CHB subjects receiving TDF, including identification of covariates influencing PK.

## 1/ Description of the analysed data set:

The  model  development  dataset  included  data  from  subjects  in  study  GS-US-74-0144.  The  dataset included 700 plasma samples from 60 subjects. A portion of the samples (60 samples) were BLQ, leaving 640 measurable TFV plasma concentrations. The remaining dataset had a total of 640 data points from 58 subjects, and was used for the analysis (Table below). Figure below shows the TFV plasma concentrations versus time profile for all subjects.

## 2/ Model development:

## o Structure Model:

Based on the previously established adult CHB PopPK model (Vemlidy PopPK model), a two-compartment model  was  considered  the  initial  base  model.  The  model  was  further  characterised  with  first  order absorption  (Ka),  and  first  order  elimination  from  the  central  compartment  and  parameterised  with apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume (Vc/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F),  apparent  peripheral  volume  (Vp/F),  and  first-order  absorption  rate  constant  (Ka),  with inter-individual variability (IIV) terms on apparent CL/F, Vc/F, and Vp/F. IOV was sequentially evaluated on each PK parameter (CL/F, Vc/F, Vp), and was included on CL/F based on statistically significant change in OFV (p&lt;0.05). Overall, TFV plasma concentrations were best described by a 2-compartment model with first order absorption, linear elimination, inter-individual variability term on CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F, IOV on CL/F, and a combined error model (Figure 2).

- o Final Model:

The effects of baseline demographic covariates (age, WT, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical region), pathophysiological covariates (BCLCRSW), disease related covariates (HBVGT, HBeAg) and FAST and FORM on TFV CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F were assessed graphically followed by linear regression (continuous covariates) and ANOVA testing (categorical covariates). Individual specific random effects (ETA) for CL/F, Vc/F, and Vp/F were plotted versus the covariates to identify potential relationships. Body weight, age, and HBeAg were found to show significant (p&lt;0.05) trends with PK parameters in this screening step and were subsequently examined further using NONMEM for significance on CL/F, Vc/F, and Vp/F.

Testing of covariates in a step-wise forward addition and backward elimination methodology for TFV resulted in the addition of only WT as a statistically covariate (p&lt;0.001) on CL/F. BCLCRSW (p=0.8) was retained as a covariate on CL/F in the final model, based on renal excretion being the predominant elimination pathway for TFV. FORM (powder versus tablet; p=0.04) was retained as a covariate on Ka to improve the characterisation of TFV absorption profile. The final model included covariates of WT and BCLCRSW on CL/F and FORM on Ka.

Table 5 shows the median and 95% CIs of the PK parameter estimates derived from bootstrap method (N = 500). Median values following bootstrapping were very similar to the parameter estimates of the original dataset and the 95% CIs overlapped with those of the original datasets, indicating that the final PopPK model was stable with good precision of parameter estimation.

## Shrinkage:

Shrinkage of the final model parameters is presented in Table 7. The η-shrinkage for CL/F was 18%, Vc/F was 47%, and Vp/F was 31% which were considered reasonable. Thus, the final PopPK model generated reliable Bayesian estimates for CL/F, Vc/F and Vp/F.

## 4/ Model-based prediction:

- -Impact of WT on TFV Exposure:

Body weight was identified as a statistically significant covariate on TFV CL/F in the final model (Table 4). The impact of WT on TFV exposure is presented in Table 9. In paediatric CHB subjects between 10.5 to 51.1 kg, TFV exposures demonstrated approximately 2-fold change between the lowest and highest AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau quartiles. These differences were not considered clinically significant, based on the factors mentioned previously.

## -Impact of BCLCRSW (Estimated creatinine clearance derived by the Schwartz equation) on TFV Exposure:

BCLCRSW was included as a covariate on TFV CL/F in the final model (Table 4). The impact of BCLCRSW on TFV exposure is presented in Table 10. In paediatric subjects across the range of BCLCRSW values (114 to 237 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), TFV exposures demonstrated approximately ≤40% difference between the lowest and highest AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau quartiles. These differences were not considered clinically significant, based on the factors mentioned previously.

## -Impact of FORM on TFV Exposure:

Formulation was included as a covariate on TFV Ka in the final model (Table 4). The impact of FORM on TFV exposure is presented in Table 11. Paediatric subjects with CHB who received the tablet formulation had higher (≤50%) AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau compared with subjects who received the powder formulation. The difference in exposures is reflective of the effect of body weight, which explains the majority of variability in TFV exposures. These differences were not considered clinically significant, based on the factors mentioned previously.

## Pharmacokinetics  of  TFV  for  Paediatric  CHB  Subjects  2  to  &lt;  12  Years  Old  Relative  to Paediatric HIV Subjects

Predicted systemic TFV exposures in paediatric CHB subject 2 to &lt; 12 years old receiving TDF 8 mg/kg were compared with those from paediatric HIV subjects of the same age who received TDF 8 mg/kg in combination with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) or nelfinavir (GS-US- 104-0352 Interim Week 48 CSR).

TDF is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).  LPV/r,  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp  and  BCRP,  has  been  shown  to  moderately  increase  mean  TFV concentrations (32%). Therefore, observed TFV AUCtau for paediatric HIV subjects who received TDF with LPV/r were scaled by AUCtau/1.32 to account for LPV/r-induced increases in TFV AUCtau. Observed TFV AUCtau for paediatric HIV subjects who received TDF with nelfinavir were not adjusted, as nelfinavir is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP.

Figure below presents the comparison of population PK-predicted systemic TFV AUCtau in pediatric CHB subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years old receiving TDF 8 mg/kg with exposures in paediatric HIV subjects of the same age who received TDF 8 mg/kg in combination with LPV/r or nelfinavir.

TFV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) were similar for the paediatric HBV and HIV subjects:

- a Population PK-predicted exposures for subjects receiving TDF in Study GS-US-174-0144.
- b Pediatic HIV subjects in Study GS-US-104-0352. PK parameters were calculated by scaling the observed exposues by AUCuw/1.32 for subjects with TDF administered with LPV/r. Observed values were used for subjects administered TDF with nelfinavir.
- GLSMs were obtained by the back-transfonmation of least-squares means of the parameters from an ANOV A using a mixed model based on the natural logarithmic scale.

The CHMP noted that the AUC was comparable between CHB paediatric population (estimated by PKpop) and HIV paediatric population (historical data) of the same age receiving the same dose of TDF.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

Exposure-response  relationships  for  efficacy  (HBV  DNA  &lt;  69  IU/mL,  ALT  normalisation)  and  safety (change from baseline in spine and whole body bone mineral density [BMD])at Week 48 were evaluated using TFV exposure estimates (AUCtau and Cmax) derived from population PK modelling.

Subjects with missing data for specific analysed endpoints were excluded from that analysis.

Five subjects were excluded from the PK/PD efficacy analysis due to missing HBV DNA values at Week 48 (missing = excluded [M = E]). One subject was excluded from the PK/PD efficacy and safety analyses due to missing ALT and whole body BMD data at Week 48, respectively (M = E).

## Exposure-Response for Efficacy

The exposure-efficacy relationship for TFV was evaluated by determining the proportion of subjects who achieved the primary (HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48) and secondary (normalised ALT at Week 48) efficacy endpoints as a function of TFV exposure quartiles (AUCtau and Cmax). Further analyses determined the proportion of subjects stratified by age (&lt; 6 years and ≥ 6 years) who achieved these efficacy endpoints as a function of median TFV exposures for that age group (i.e., above or below the age group median).

- -by TFV AUCtau and Cmax Quartiles

Overall, high virologic response rates were observed across all quartiles, with no statistically significant trends observed in the exposure-response relationship (p = 0.44 for TFV AUCtau, p = 0.14 for TFV Cmax). Of the 4 subjects in Q1 who did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 48, 2 subjects achieved HBV DNA&lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 56 or 72.

<!-- image -->

Analysis were based on an M = E approach.

The numbers presented in brackets are the sample size, minimal, median, and maximal values of the TFV PK parameter.

For both TFV AUCtau and Cmax, a numerically higher proportion of subjects in Q1 and Q3 compared with Q2 and Q4 had ALT normalisation at Week 48. The reason for these numerical differences is unclear; there were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of subjects with ALT normalisation at Week 48 observed across quartiles (p =0.42 for TFV AUCtau, p = 0.25 for TFV Cmax)

<!-- image -->

- -by Age (2 to &lt; 6 years and ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years)

For subjects in the 2 to &lt; 6 years old group, there were no statistically significant differences in response rates for those with TFV exposures above or below the age group medians (p = 1.00 TFV AUCtau, p = 0.62 for TFV Cmax). Similarly, for subjects in the ≥ 6 to 12 years old group, the differences in response rates for subjects with TFV exposures above or below the age group medians were not statistically significant (p = 1.00 for TFV AUCtau, p = 0.60 for TFV Cmax).

<!-- image -->

A numerically higher proportion of subjects in the both age groups with TFV AUCtau below the age group median had ALT normalisation at Week 48 compared with subjects with AUCtau above the age group median. The difference was statistically significant for the ≥ 6 years old group (p = 0.045) but not for the &lt; 6 years old group (p = 0.15). The proportion of subjects with ALT normalisation at Week 48 was similar for those &lt; 6 years and ≥ 6 years with AUCtau below the age group median.

A numerically higher proportion of subjects &lt; 6 years old with TFV Cmax below the age group median compared with above the age group median had  ALT normalisation at Week 48.  The proportion of subjects ≥6 years old with ALT normalisation at Week 48 was similar for those above or below the age group median; no statistically significant differences were observed in the proportion of subjects with ALT normalisation by Cmax (p = 0.15 and p = 0.74 for subjects &lt; 6 years and ≥ 6 years, respectively)

- -Pharmacokinetics of TFV for Paediatric CHB Subjects With and Without HBeAg Seroconversion at W48

Due to small sample sizes, the same exposure-response analyses (by quartiles, age, etc.) were not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

planned for HBeAg seroconversion; instead a comparison of TFV exposure by subjects who did or did not have HBeAg seroconversion at Week 48 was performed.

A comparison of the population PK model-predicted systemic TFV AUCtau between subjects who had HBeAg seroconversion and those who did not have HBeAg seroconversion at Week 48. The TFV AUCtau of subjects with seroconversion was within the range of the exposure of subjects without seroconversion. Similar results were observed for TFV Cmax.

Horizontal lines on the box plots are median and interquartile ranges; circles represent individual values, diamonds represent mean values, and vertical lines are maximum snd minimum values within 1.5 x the interquartile range.

## Exposure-Response for Safety

The  exposure-efficacy  relationship  for  TFV  was  evaluated  by  determining  the  percent  change  from baseline in spine and whole body BMD as a function of TFV exposure quartiles (AUCtau and Cmax). Further analyses determined the proportion of subjects stratified by age (&lt; 6 years and ≥ 6 years) who achieved these safety endpoints as a function of median TFV exposures for that age group (i.e., above or below the age group median).

- -By TFV AUCtau and Cmax Quartiles

The median percent changes from baseline in spine and whole body BMD were similar across quartiles of TFV AUCtau and Cmax, indicating the lack of an exposure-safety relationship (spine BMD: p = 0.100 for TFV AUCtau, p = 0.40 for TFV Cmax; whole body BMD: p=0.47 for TFV AUCtau, p = 0.50 for TFV Cmax).

Within age groups, there were no significant differences in percent change from baseline in spine BMD for subjects &lt; 6 years old (p = 1.00 for TFV AUCtau and p = 0.27 for TFV Cmax) or subjects ≥ 6 years old (p = 0.22 for TFV AUC tau and p = 0.62 for TFV Cmax).

For both age groups, the percent changes from baseline in whole BMD were numerically similar for subjects with TFV AUCtau and Cmax above or below the age group median. Within age groups, there were no significant differences in percent change from baseline in whole body BMD for subjects &lt; 6 years old (p = 0.89 for TFV AUCtau and p = 0.53 for TFV Cmax) or subjects ≥ 6 years old (p = 0.75 for TFV AUC tau and p = 0.80 for TFV Cmax).

These results indicated an overall lack of exposure-response relationship between TFV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) and percent changes from baseline in spine and whole body BMD at Week 48 by age group.

Horizontal lines on the boxplots are median and interquartile ranges; circles represent individual values,diamonds represent mean values, and vertical lines are maximum and minimum values within 1.5 x the interquartile range. Nuumbers in brackets below each plot are sample size, minimum, median, and maximum values for TFV AUCuu or Cm for subjects included in the subgroup.

The CHMP noted that the Relationship between TFV exposure (AUC and Cmax) and efficacy (HBV DNA &lt;69 IU/ml, ALT normalisation, HBeAg seroconversion) and safety (spine and whole body BMD) was explored by PK pop analysis and that no clinically significant differences were observed in exposure-response relationship.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  PK  of  TFV  in  paediatric  CHB  subjects  was  evaluated  using  all  sparse  and  intensive  plasma concentration data available from Study GS-US-174-0144. Tenofovir exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) were estimated using a population PK approach, and compared with historical data in paediatric subjects infected with HIV who were receiving the same dose of TDF (i.e., 8 mg/kg).

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Tenofovir exposures in CHB paediatric subjects were estimated using a population PK approach and were found similar to historical data in HIV infected paediatric subjects. Clarification was required by the CHMP on the PK pop analysis before concluding on the reliability of the exposure estimation.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study - GS-US-174-0144

## Title of Study:

Study  GS-US-174-0144  is  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  double-blind,  multicentre  study  to  evaluate  the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of TDF versus Placebo in paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years with chronic hepatitis B infection.

## Methods

The study is ongoing.

Approximately 100 TDF-naive subjects with HBV DNA &gt; 10 5  copies/mL and ALT &gt;1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening were to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatments:

- TDF once daily by mouth for 48 weeks
- Placebo-to-match TDF once daily by mouth for 48 weeks

<!-- image -->

Randomisation was stratified by age (&lt; 6 years, ≥ 6 years) and geographic region (North America/Europe and Asia).

In the original study protocol (22 July 2011), subjects received double-blind TDF or placebo for 72 weeks, after  which  subjects  received  open-label  TDF  for  an  additional  120  weeks  (to  Week  192/end  of treatment). Subjects who were randomised into the study following protocol Amendment 3 (29 February 2016) received double-blind TDF or placebo for 48 weeks, after which subjects received open-label TDF for an additional 144 weeks (to Week 192/end of treatment). Subjects who were beyond Week 48 of double-blind treatment when protocol Amendment 3 became effective continued double-blind treatment to Week 72 (as originally planned) and switched to open-label TDF at the Week 72 visit.

All subjects who completed the study to Week 192 were offered continuation of open-label TDF in an extension phase until TDF became commercially available for patients of their age and weight in the country of their enrolment. During the extension phase, subjects were to attend study visits every 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks to assess efficacy and safety, conduct study drug accountability, and dispense study drug.

The interim Week 48 analysis was conducted after all randomised subjects had completed the Week 48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued study drug. All data collected by the Week 48 data cut (10 August 2017), except bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical laboratory data, which were collected up to the data finalisation date (16 January 2018), were included in the interim report provided in support of the extension of indication.

- Any other condition (including alcohol or substance abuse) or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator,  would  make  the  subject  unsuitable  for  the  study  or  unable  to  comply  with  dosing requirements.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomised to receive TDF (150, 200, 250, or 300 mg tablets or 40 mg/gram powder) or placebo to match TDF tablets and powder once daily with or without food followed by 240 mL of water.

The recommended oral dose of TDF for HIV infected paediatric patients ≥ 2 years is 8 mg/kg of body weight, to a maximum of 300 mg/day (&gt; 35 kg).

In this study,

- -paediatric subjects who weighed &gt; 17 kg and were able to swallow tablets received weight-based TDF as a 150, 200, 250, or 300 mg tablet (or matching placebo tablet) once daily.
- -Subjects who weighed ≥ 17 kg but were unable to swallow a tablet and subjects who weighed &lt; 17 kg received weight-based TDF as oral powder (or matching placebo powder).

Throughout the study, and depending on country-specific regulations, subjects were required to take a daily multivitamin. Multivitamins were supplied by the study site and contained ≥ 400 IU of vitamin D.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding

During the blinded portion of the study, HBV DNA results were not distributed to investigators, subjects, or clinical research personnel involved in the clinical conduct of the study. The only exceptions were if a Grade 4 ALT event was maintained for 16 weeks or an ALT flare occurred, both of which were considered situations of medical need; in those cases, serial HBV DNA values from screening through the duration of the event were made available to the investigator.

Blinding of study treatment was critical to the integrity of the study; therefore, if a subject's treatment assignment was disclosed to the investigator, the subject was discontinued from blinded study treatment and offered open-label TDF.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was:

- To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of TDF versus placebo in paediatric subjects (aged 2 to &lt; 12 years at the time of enrolment) with CHB

The key secondary objective of this study was :

- To evaluate the proportion of subjects with HBeAg seroconversion at Week 48 for subjects with baseline HBeAg seropositivity.

Other secondary objectives of this study were:

- To characterise the safety and tolerability profile of TDF in paediatric subjects (aged 2 to &lt; 12 years at the time of enrolment) with CHB

- To evaluate the biochemical and serological responses to TDF versus placebo

-  To  evaluate  the  incidence  of  potential  resistance  mutations  to  TDF  in  HBV  polymerase/reverse transcriptase (pol/RT)

- To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tenofovir (TFV) in subjects receiving the tablet formulation of TDF and those receiving the oral powder formulation of TDF.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the FAS with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 (according to the PCR-based assay).

The M = F approach was used for missing data. Accordingly, all missing HBV DNA data were treated as failing to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., HBV DNA was ≥ 69 IU/mL).

The primary efficacy analysis was conducted for the FAS after all randomised subjects had completed the Week 48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued study drug. The difference in the proportion of subjects  who  achieved  the  primary  endpoint  in  each  treatment  group  was  calculated  using  a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for the stratification factors age at baseline (&lt; 6 years, &gt; 6 years) and region (North America/Europe, Asia).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

A sample size of 100 subjects (67 subjects in the TDF group, 33 subjects in the Placebo group) would provide at least 85% power to detect a 20% treatment difference between TDF and placebo for the primary endpoint, assuming that the response rate for the TDF group would be 21% and the response rate for the Placebo group would be 1%. This calculation was based on a 2-sided Fisher's exact test with a significance level of 0.05. A similar placebo-response rate was observed in Study GS-US-174-0115 (0% at Week 48).

Due to difficulty enrolling subjects, and to limit exposure of subjects to placebo, the FDA agreed that approximately 90 subjects would be sufficient to conduct the study. The reduced sample size was unlikely to impact the power of the study, even adjusting for a change in the primary endpoint from Week 72 to Week 48, as the originally assumed response rate for the TDF group was only 21%. If the assumed response rate for the TDF group was adjusted to 80%, which is similar to the observed TDF-response rate in Study GS-US-174-0115 (86.5% at Week 48), the study would have well over 85% power with a sample size of 90 subjects. Initially, the primary efficacy endpoint should evaluate the difference between the TDF and Placebo treatment groups using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test. Instead, a CMH test was used that controlled for the randomisation stratification factors of age group and region. A 2-sided Fisher's exact test was used to perform sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint.

The individual efficacy measurements used in this study were standard for evaluating the antiviral activity of a drug in adults and paediatric patients with CHB. Reductions in HBV DNA levels indicate suppression of active viral replication, and permanent HBsAg seroconversion and normalisation of liver enzyme levels are usually accepted indicators of therapeutic benefit. The Roche COBAS TaqMan HBV test for use with the High Pure System was used to measure plasma HBV DNA in this study. It is the same assay used in the Phase 3 studies that led to TDF registration for treatment of CHB infection (Studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103) and the same assay used to assess the antiviral efficacy of TDF compared with placebo in adolescent subjects with CHB (GS-US-320-0115). While the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay is 29 IU/mL, the primary endpoint was based on a cut-off of 69 IU/mL (i.e., 400 copies/mL) as this was considered the standard of care at the time this study was initiated {Allice 2007}. The LLOQ of  the  assay  (29  IU/mL)  was  included  as  a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint.  An  endpoint  of  HBV  DNA suppression is widely recognised as a  useful marker for the assessment of  antiviral activity in CHB patients {Lok 2001}. Levels of HBsAg were quantified using the Abbott ARCHITECT assay, with an LLOQ of ≤ 0.05 IU/mL {Covance Central Laboratory Services 2014, Lou 2011}.

## Results

## Recruitment - Disposition of patients

Study GS-US-174-0144 was conducted at a total of 24 study centres in 6 countries (6 sites in India, 6 sites in South Korea, 6 sites in the US, 3 sites in Romania, 2 sites in Taiwan, and 1 site in Bulgaria).

A total of 90 eligible subjects were randomised, and 89 randomised subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the Full Analysis Set (60 subjects in the TDF group and 29 subjects in the Placebo group). A total of 7 prematurely discontinued double-blind study treatment (4 subjects in the TDF group and 3 in the Placebo group).

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments

The original study protocol (22 July 2011) was amended 4 times. Key changes to the protocol for each amendment were as follows:

- The protocol was amended for the first time on 07 March 2012; changes at Amendment 1 were primarily updates to/clarification of study objectives, eligibility criteria, study procedures, and use of concomitant medications and oral contraception. Administrative changes were also made (change in medical monitor, updated schedule of data monitoring committee [DMC] meetings).
- The protocol was amended for the second time on 08 November 2012. Key changes in Amendment 2 included  updates to  the  design  and  conduct  of  the  PK  substudy  in  response  to  regulatory  authority comments. Subject dosing diaries, a section defining special situations and instructions for reporting special situations, and criterion and instructions for unblinding an investigator in the event of a medical emergency were also introduced. Other changes included a change in medical monitor and clarification of study objectives, eligibility criteria, and procedures.
- The protocol was amended for the third time on 29 February 2016. At this time, due to difficulty enrolling subjects, to limit exposure of subjects to placebo, and upon agreement of the FDA that approximately 90 subjects would be sufficient to conduct the study, the primary efficacy endpoint was changed from Week 72 to Week 48. The amendment specified that upon completing 48 weeks of blinded treatment, all subjects would switch to open-label TDF for the remainder of the study, and subjects who were beyond Week 48 under the previous protocol would switch to open-label TDF at Week 72 (as originally planned). All subjects would receive open-label TDF until Week 192 (end of study). Other amendments to the protocol included a change in the medical monitor, updates to the schedule of study assessments, and modifications to improve clarity and consistency throughout the protocol.
- The protocol was amended for the fourth time on 04 August 2016. At that time, an extension phase was added, whereby all subjects who completed the study were offered the opportunity to continue receiving open-label TDF until the time that TDF became commercially available for patients of their age and weight in the country of their enrolment. During the extension period, subjects were to attend study visits every

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12  weeks.  Study  procedures  were  updated  accordingly.  Protocol  Amendment  4  also  clarified  the requirements  for  dual-energy  X-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA)  scans  and  biochemical  bone  marker assessments  performed  at  Week  192/end  of  study  or  premature  discontinuation  of  study  drug  and updated the physical description of TDF 300 mg tablets.

## Protocol deviations

A total of 43 subjects had at least 1 important protocol deviation (IPD), and the IPD categories were similar  for  the  TDF  and  Placebo  groups.  Overall,  the  most  common  IPDs  were  due  to  treatment compliance  (33.3%  of  subjects),  off-schedule  procedures  (11.1%  of  subjects),  and  deviations  from eligibility criteria (10.0% of subjects).

Subjects with multiple important protocol deviations were counted only once in each protocol deviation category.

Most of the other treatment compliance issues were due to IP kits not retuumed and subject noncompliance.

Most  of  the  other  treatment  compliance  issues  were  due  to  IP  kits  not  returned  and  subject noncompliance.

None of these IPDs was considered to have affected the overall quality or interpretation of the study data.

## Baseline data

## Demographic Characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for the TDF and Placebo groups. Overall, the median age was 6 years (range: 2 to 12 years; 1 subject in the Placebo group turned 12 years old prior to the baseline/Day 1 visit), and the majority of subjects were male (56.2%), Asian (65.2% [including 15.7% Indian]); only 30% were White and there were no subject Hispanic or Latino. The median BMI value at baseline was 15.5 kg/m 2  (range: 11.6 to 26.7 kg/m 2 ), and the median BMI Z-score was -0.12 (range: -5.57 to 2.97).

## Baseline Disease Characteristics

Baseline disease characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups. The median (Q1, Q3) baseline HBV DNA value was 8.2 (7.8, 8.7) log10 IU/mL, and median (Q1, Q3) HBsAg was 4.49 (3.97, 4.72) log10 IU/mL. Overall, 83.1% of subjects had baseline ALT &gt; 1.5 × ULN based on central laboratory criteria, and the median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR by the Schwartz formula was 166.7 (144.4, 187.5) mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

Most subjects were infected with HBV genotype C (43.8%), reflective of the high proportion of non-Indian Asian subjects, or genotype D (41.6%), reflective of Indian and North American/European subjects. The majority of subjects (95.5%) were HBeAg positive at baseline.

Four subjects in the TDF  group were HBeAg-negative and anti-HBe positive at baseline; 1 of these subjects was HBeAg positive at screening. Overall, 75.3% of subjects were naive to prior HBV treatment, and a greater proportion of subjects in the Placebo group compared with the TDF group had received prior HBV  treatment  (41.4%  vs  16.7%,  respectively;  p  =  0.012),  primarily  with  interferon  alfa  and/or lamivudine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note, ALT ULN was defined using 2 criteria: that of the central laboratory and that of the American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD):

- Central laboratory ALT ULN was 34 U/L for females aged 2-15 years old or males aged 1-9 years old, and 43 U/L for males aged 10-15 years old.
- AASLD ALT ULN was 30 U/L for paediatric subjects between 0-12 years old.

## Treatment Compliance

Median (Q1, Q3) adherence to double-blind dosing was 98.9% (94.0%, 100.0%) for the TDF group and 99.4% (97.0%, 100.0%) for the Placebo group. Most subjects in the TDF (95.0%) and Placebo (89.7%) groups had ≥ 80% adherence to double-blind study drug, and a greater proportion of subjects in the Placebo group had adherence &lt; 80% (10.3%) compared with the TDF group (5.0%).

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48.

A significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with TDF group compared with Placebo achieved HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 (76.7% vs 6.9%, p &lt; 0.001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The between-group difference was also observed when HBV DNA &lt; 29 IU/mL at Week 48 was evaluated. Only 3 of 46 subjects in the TDF group with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 did not achieve complete suppression (i.e., HBV DNA &lt; 29 IU/mL). A similar percentages of subjects in the TDF (8.3%) and Placebo (10.3%) groups were considered treatment failures at Week 48 due to missing data .

The denominator for percentages was the number of subjects in the Full Analysis Set.

The results were similar when the primary efficacy endpoint analysis was conducted using the missing = excluded (M = E) approach (TDF 83.6%, 46 of 55 subjects; Placebo 7.7%, 2 of 26 subjects; p &lt; 0.001) and when using the Per Protocol Analysis Set with a missing = failure (M = F) approach (TDF 84.6%, 44 of 52 subjects; Placebo 8.0%, 2 of 25 subjects; p &lt; 0.001).

Additionally, a Breslow-Day test of homogeneity confirmed the assumption of homogenous odds ratios for subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 in the TDF group versus the Placebo group across randomisation strata (p = 0.129), indicating that the CMH test of group differences was appropriate.

## Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint

Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint using a M = F approach were conducted to evaluate what effect, if any, changing the duration of double-blind treatment from 72 weeks to 48 weeks under protocol Amendment 3 had on the primary efficacy endpoint.

For the subset of subjects included in the sensitivity analysis who completed Week 48 or discontinued blinded study drug prior to protocol Amendment 3, a statistically significant greater proportion in the TDF group compared with the Placebo group achieved HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 and Week 72 as follows:

- Week 48 TDF: 73.5%, 36 of 49 subjects, 95% CI 58.9% to 85.1%; Placebo: 4.2%, 1 of 24 subjects, 95% CI 0.1% to 21.1%; p &lt; 0.001
- Week 72 TDF: 79.6%, 39 of 49 subjects, 95% CI 65.7% to 89.8%; Placebo 12.5%, 3 of 24 subjects, 95% CI 2.7% to 32.4%; p &lt; 0.001

## Secondary endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Virologic suppression

Between-group differences in the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL were statistically significant at all assessments from Week 16 through Week 48.

Figure 1. GS-US-174-0144: Proportion of Subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL by Visit to Week 48, Missing = Failure (Full Analysis Set)

<!-- image -->

Treatment with TDF resulted in rapid decreases in HBV DNA. At every assessment from Week 4 through 48, the decline from baseline in HBV DNA was significantly greater for the TDF group compared with the Placebo group.

<!-- image -->

HBV DNA values below the 1ower limit of quantitation were imputed as 28 IU/mL (or 1.45 loguo IU/mL)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP noted that the kinetic of the virologic response is comparable to the one previously reported in adults study.

## HBeAg and HBsAg Loss and Seroconversion

The proportions of subjects with HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion progressively increased from baseline over 48 weeks of double-blind treatment and the proportion of subjects with HBeAg loss and seroconversion were similar for each treatment group at each time-point evaluated.

At Week 48, 30.4% of subjects in the TDF group and 27.6% of subjects in the Placebo group had achieved HBeAg loss, and 25.0% and 24.1%, respectively, had achieved HBeAg seroconversion. No statistically significant between-group differences in HBeAg loss or seroconversion were observed at any time point evaluated.

According to the MAH ad-hoc analysis showed that prior anti-HBV treatment did not appear to have an effect on the rate of HBeAg loss or seroconversion.

The proportion of subjects with HBsAg loss and seroconversion was minimal for both the TDF and Placebo groups  (3.3%  and  3.4%,  respectively,  at  Week  48).  No  subjects  in  either  group  achieved  HBsAg seroconversion during 48 weeks of treatment.

## Alanine Aminotransferase Normalisation

Nearly all subjects had abnormal ALT levels at baseline, including 96.7% in the TDF group and 93.1% in the Placebo group by central laboratory criteria, and 100.0% in the TDF group and 96.6% in the Placebo group by AASLD criterion (≤ 30 U/L).

By both criteria, the proportion of subjects with ALT normalisation was significantly greater for the TDF group compared with the Placebo group at Week 48.

Central laboratory normal ALT was defined as ≤ 34 U/L for females 2-15 years or males 1-9 years old, and ≤ 43 U/L for males 10-15 years.

AASLD normal ALT was defined as ≤30 U/L for males and females 0-12 years.

P-values were based on 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests adjusted for age at baseline and region strata.

The CHMP noted that the biochemical response was significantly higher in the TDF arm.

## Composites of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

When composite endpoints that included HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL, normal ALT, normalised ALT, and/or HBeAg loss or seroconversion were assessed, a significantly greater proportion of subjects with abnormal ALT at baseline in the TDF group compared with the Placebo group had achieved both ALT normalisation and HBV &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48.

In contrast, there were no between-group differences observed for any of the composite endpoints that included HBeAg loss or seroconversion and HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL. However, the proportion of subjects was numerically higher in the TDF group compared with the Placebo group for each of the 3-endpoint composites of HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL plus ALT normalisation (by central laboratory or AASLD criteria), plus HBeAg loss or seroconversion at Week 48.

P-values were based on 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests adjusted for age at baseline and region shata.

95% CIs were caleulated using the Clopper-Pearson method.

HBeAg seroconversion was defined as HBeAg loss and a change from HBeAb negative or missing at baseline to HBeAb positive.

HBeAg loss was defined as a change firom HBeAg positive at baseline to HBeAg negative with baseline HBeAb negative or missing.

Central laboratory normal ALT was ≤ 34 U/L for females 2-15 years old or males 1-9 years old, and ≤ 43 U/L for males aged 10-15 years old.

AASLD normal ALT was ≤ 30 U/L for males and females 0-12 years old.

## Subgroup Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint

Analysis of the proportion of subjects who achieved HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL by selected demographic and disease characteristics demonstrated that, with the exception of subjects with baseline ALT ≤ 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN; by either central laboratory or AASLD criteria), between-group differences were statistically significant for each of the subgroups evaluated, with a greater proportion of subjects in the TDF group achieving HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For subjects with ALT ≤ 2 × ULN at baseline, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL at Week 48 was numerically higher in the TDF group compared with the Placebo group; the small number of subjects included in the baseline ALT ≤ 2 × ULN category likely contributed to the lack of a statistically significant between-group difference, as evidenced by the wide 95% CIs.

## Ancillary analyses

## Virologic Resistance

Population sequence analysis of the HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase (pol/RT; amino acids 1-344) was attempted on serum samples obtained from all subjects at baseline and from subjects with HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL at Week 48 or at the time of early discontinuation of study drug for subjects with at least 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. This included subjects treated with TDF and those treated with placebo, since the study remained blinded through 48 weeks of treatment.

Virologic breakthrough was defined as confirmed HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL after having had HBV DNA &lt; 69 IU/mL during double-blind treatment or a ≥ 1.0 log10 increase from nadir in HBV DNA. Phenotypic resistance  evaluations  were  performed  for  all  subjects  in  the  TDF  group  who  either  developed substitutions at a conserved site or had virologic breakthrough.

A total of 10 subjects qualified for sequence analysis in the TDF group at W48: 8 subjects had HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL in the absence of virologic breakthrough, 1 subject (Subject 8993-1074) experienced an unconfirmed virologic blip, and 1 subject (Subject 9045-1043) experienced a virologic breakthrough.

Of 10 subjects in the TDF treatment group who qualified for sequence analysis at Week 48, 4 had no change from baseline sequence, 4 had polymorphic site substitutions, 1 had a conserved site substitution, and 1 was unable to be sequenced due to sample unavailability. No substitutions were detected in more than 1 subject in the TDF group.

- f Subject 8993-1074 had no serum sample available at Week 24; therefore, sequence results were not available.

Of 26 subjects in the Placebo group who qualified for sequence analysis at Week 48, 18 had no change from baseline sequence.

Two subjects in the TDF group met the criteria for phenotypic evaluation. One subject qualified at Week 48,  with  a  conserved  site  substitution  in  the  absence  of  virologic  breakthrough.  The  other  subject qualified due to virologic breakthrough with no sequence changes from baseline detected.

All post-baseline virus pools that were successfully tested remained sensitive to TFV based on fold change from  baseline  in  EC50.  Results  from  sequence  analyses  and  phenotypic  evaluation  demonstrate  no development of resistance to TDF at Week 48.

No  patients  had  TDF resistance-associated mutation through week 48 in this study.
- The study is ongoing with a FU of 192 weeks and will provide longer term data on resistance to TDF in children.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

To support the extension of the indication for VIREAD in children chronically infected with HBV, the MAH is submitting the interim Week 48 analysis (primary endpoint) of the ongoing study GS-US-174-0144. This study is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Tenofovir DF in paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years old.

The study was initiated in December 2012 and was primarily conducted in Asia and North America/Europe (the EU centres being in Romania and Bulgaria). At the time of the study initiation, entecavir was not yet approved in children and the study was designed as a placebo controlled study. The study therefore compared TDF and placebo over 48 weeks, at which time children from the placebo arm could switch to open-label TDF. Given the significant rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion in children and the concern around the bone and renal toxicity of TDF in children, a placebo-controlled study is appropriate. The open-label phase of the study (until Week 192) will provide useful information on the longer-term safety and durability of virologic response.

To select a paediatric population with immune-active disease, children should have ALT&gt;1.5 ULN at screening.  The  cut-off  was  chosen  based  on  recommendation  from  US  experts  panel  and  ESPGHAN guidelines. However, while US and EU experts recommends ALT should be persistently elevated (&gt;1.5 ULN on at least 2 occasions over 6 months), children were eligible in the study if ALT were &gt;1.5 ULN at screening without confirmation required. Therefore, whether all paediatric patients included in this study were in active immune phase is questionable, all the more there was no biopsy requirement in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study population consists mostly in male (56%), mean age of 6 y.o (even though 63% were &gt;6 y.o) of Asian origin (65%). Patients from US/Europe represents 45% of the study population and vertical transmission account for 73% of the source of contamination.

Contrarily to the study in HBV-infected adolescent, for which 85% of patients had prior exposure to anti-HBV agents, the majority of children were treatment naïve in this study. Of note, a significantly higher proportion of patients having received prior HBV treatment in the Placebo group (41.4% versus 16.7% in the Viread group). Moreover, all but 4 children had HBeAg+ disease. The MAH nevertheless applies for an unqualified (large) indication, which is acceptable when considering the efficacy of tenofovir in adults is regarded as established in both HBeAg+ and HBeAg- disease and prior exposure to anti-HBV agents did not impact response to TDF in adults and adolescents.

The primary objective of the study is to confirm the antiviral efficacy of Viread in children as a surrogate of the clinical benefit of the drug. Even though the association between viral suppression and reduction of the risk of progression of liver disease is less documented in paediatric patients, durable suppression of viral replication is acknowledged to be an appropriate marker in children.

As expected, a striking superiority  of  TDF  over  placebo  was  demonstrated  on  the  primary  endpoint (proportion of patients with HBV DNA &lt;69 IU/ml, equivalent to &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 48). Patients with abnormal ALT at baseline had notably greater rate of response as compared to patients who had normal ALT at baseline. Response rate was also higher in children aged &gt;6 y.o as compared to younger children.

Biochemical response was also significantly higher in the TDF arm. However, as previously raised for adolescents and for adults, the superior virological potency of TDF did not translate into a superior rate of HBeAg seroconversion. As a matter of fact, the rate of HBeAg seroconversion was similar in the TDF and the placebo arm at W48, and was around 25%. A similar very low proportion of patients (3%) achieved HBsAg loss and no patients achieved HBs seroconversion.

Similarly  to  adults,  TDF  seems  to  have  a  high  genetic  barrier  in  children  as  no  patients  had  TDF resistance-associated mutation through week 48 in this study.

Overall, the antiviral activity of TDF appears as high in children as in adolescents and in adults. Only 25% of TDF-treated patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion, a rate comparing similarly to the spontaneous rate of seroconversion reported in the placebo arm. This illustrates the need for a long-time treatment in the  majority  of  children  therefore  calls  for  a  cautious  assessment  of  the  benefit  versus  the  risk  of resistance and bone/renal toxicity in these young growing children.

The study is ongoing with an open-label phase for up to a total of 4 years that will help to document longer-term efficacy/safety and resistance of TDF in HBV-infected children.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Even  though  TDF  did  not  improve  HBeAg  seroconversion  rate  as  compared  to  spontaneous seroconversion, a striking superiority of TDF over placebo was demonstrated on the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with HBV DNA &lt;69 IU/ml, equivalent to &lt;400 copies/ml) at Week 48. Virologic endpoint  has  been  admitted  as  appropriate  surrogate  endpoint  in  HBV-infected  adults  but  also  in adolescent  and  younger  children,  for  which  Baraclude  has  already  been  approved  for  use  in  this population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with abnormal ALT at baseline had notably greater rate of response as compared to patients who had normal ALT at baseline. Response rate was also higher in children aged &gt;6 y.o as compared to younger children.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

Safety data are presented for 89 subjects treated with TDF (n = 60) or Placebo (n = 29) included in study GS-US-174-0144 as of the data cut for the Week 48 interim analysis (10 August 2017), except bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical laboratory data, which were collected up to the data finalisation date (16 January 2018).

## Patient exposure

Median (Q1, Q3) weeks of exposure to blinded study drug was 71.9 (59.8, 72.3) weeks for subjects in the TDF group and 71.9 (48.7, 72.1) weeks for subjects in the Placebo group. The majority of subjects in each treatment group had received blinded study drugs for ≥ 48 weeks at the time of the Week 48 data cut date (TDF 85.0%, 51 of 60 subjects; placebo 86.2%, 25 of 29 subjects).

Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  for  the  TDF  and  Placebo  treatment  groups. Overall, the median age was 6 years and the majority of subjects were male (56.2%), Asian (65.2%). The median body mass index (BMI) value at baseline was 15.5 kg/m 2  (range: 11.6 to 26.7 kg/m 2 ), and the median BMI Z-score was -0.12 (range: -5.57 to 2.97).

## Drug-related AEs

Nine subjects (15.0%) in the TDF group and 4 subjects (13.8%) in the Placebo group had AEs that were assessed as related to study drug by the investigator. The only treatment-related AE that was reported for &gt; 1 subject in either treatment group was increased ALT: 4 subjects (6.7%) in the TDF group and 2 subjects (6.9%) in the Placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse event/deaths

No deaths had been reported at the time of the interim analysis.

A total of 16.7% of subjects in the TDF group and 6.9% in the Placebo group had an SAE. The only SAE reported for &gt; 1 subject in either treatment group was ALT increased (4 subjects in the TDF group and 1 subject in the Placebo group).

Three SAEs in the TDF group (ALT increased) and one SAE in the placebo group (hypoglycaemia) were considered as related to study drug by the investigator.

## Adverse events of specific interest

## Renal Safety

## Renal adverse events

Two subjects both in the TDF group experienced AEs under the SOC Renal and urinary disorders, one 5-year-old Asian male patient had Grade1 AEs of hydronephrosis and pelvi-ureteric obstruction and one 3-year-old Asian male had a non-serious Grade 1 AE of dysuria. None of them were considered as related to study drug by the investigator.

## Serum creatinine

At baseline, serum creatinine levels were comparable between TDF and placebo arms. Slight increases from baseline were reported in both treatment groups at week 48 of +0.05 (0.092) mg/dL in TDF group and +0.01 (0.082) mg/dL in placebo group.

There were no confirmed increases from baseline in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or decreases from baseline in serum phosphorus &lt; 2 mg/dL

## Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate

At baseline, median eGFR was similar for the TDF and Placebo groups. As shown in the figure below, the median (Q1, Q3) decrease from baseline in eGFR at week 48 was significantly greater for the TDF group ( -8.71  [ -27.86,  4.99]  mL/min/1.72  m 2 )  compared  with  the  Placebo  group  ( -0.09  [ -14.44,  20.20] mL/min/1.72 m 2 ); p = 0.047.

## (Observed Data), Safety Analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

During the double-blind treatment phase, 2 subjects in the TDF group (3.3%) and 1 subject in the Placebo group (3.4%) had eGFR (CLcr; using the Schwartz formula) &lt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The same Placebo subject also had an event of CLcr &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

## Bone safety

## Bone-Related Adverse Events

Bone-related AEs were reported for 4 subjects (6.7%) in the TDF group and 1 subject (3.4%) in the Placebo group during the double-blind treatment phase:

A 6-year-old Asian male experienced a fracture of left arm) on Day 2 of double-blind treatment after experiencing a fall in the placebo group.

The four bone-related AEs in the TDF arm are presented thereafter:

- -A -7-year-old Asian female receiving TDF experienced a Grade 1 non serious pain in jaw concurrent with Grade 1 headache on Day 356. The AEs were assessed as unrelated to study drug by the investigator; study drug was not interrupted or discontinued, and both jaw pain and headache were resolved on Day 371. At the end of double-blind, this subject demonstrated an overall decrease from baseline in spine BMD ( -2.12%) and an overall increase from baseline in whole body BMD (+2.06%).Spine and whole body BMD Z scores were within the normal range for age at all time points evaluated.
- -A 7-year-old Asia, male receiving TDF had a Grade 2, non-serious tibia  fracture on Day 14. Whether the fracture was related to trauma was not reported The AE was assessed as unrelated to study drug by the investigator; study drug was not interrupted or discontinued, and the AE was considered resolved on Day 98. At the end of double-blind treatment, this subject demonstrated an overall increase from baseline in spine BMD (+6.75%) and an overall decrease from baseline in whole body BMD ( -10.13%). Spine and whole body BMD Z scores were within the normal range for age at all time points evaluated.
- -A 7-year-old Asian male in the TDF group, had Grade 1, non-serious BMD decreased on Day 170. The subject was treated with calcium phosphate. The AE was assessed as related to study drug  by  the  investigator;  study  drug  was  not  interrupted  or  discontinued.  At  the  end  of double-blind treatment, this subject demonstrated an overall increase in spine BMD (+8.82%) and an overall decrease in whole body BMD ( -9.93%). This subject's spine BMD Z-scores were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within the normal range for age at all time points evaluated; however, whole body BMD Z-scores were below the normal range for age at every time point evaluated (range -2.86 to -3.15).

- -A 9-year-old Asian male in the TDF group, had a Grade 1, non-serious AE of osteopenia reported on Day 169 that was assessed as related to study drug by the investigator. The subject was treated  with  risedronate  sodium  and  calcium  citrate  with  colecalciferol.  Study  drug  was  not interrupted or discontinued. Osteopenia was ongoing at the time of the Week 48 data cut. This subject also experienced a Grade 1, non-serious traumatic (per investigator report) fracture of the  sternum on  Day  836  during  the  open-label  dosing  period.  The  sternum  fracture  was assessed as unrelated to study drug by the investigator and was considered resolved on Day 867. At the end of double-blind treatment, this subject demonstrated overall increases from baseline in spine (+6.47%) and whole body (+7.77%) BMD. Spine and whole body BMD Z-scores were within the normal range for age for the duration of double-blind treatment, with the exception of the spine BMD Z-score at Week 24, which was below the normal range ( -2.06)

## Cumulative Incidence of ≥ 4% Decrease from Baseline in Spine and Whole Body Bone Mineral Density

The following table presents the cumulative incidence of ≥ 4% decreases from baseline in spine and whole body BMD at Weeks 24 and 48 by treatment group. At each time point evaluated, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 4% decreases in spine and whole body BMD was numerically higher for subjects in the TDF  group  compared  with  the  Placebo  group;  the  between-group  differences  were  not  statistically significant. With 1 exception (spine BMD for a TDF subject), subjects in both groups who experienced ≥ 4% decreases from baseline in BMD did so at Week 24

BMD = bone mineral density

Whole body BMD was calculated using the BodyTotalNoHead' region

Spine BMD was calculated using the 'SpineTotalAdequate' region.

BMD measurements and corresponding Z-scores were corrected for longitudinal changes in the scanner calibration

Missing Z-scores were either due to data not available in the manufacturer's references tables, or subjects were analyzed on an older DPX-NT machine which performs analysis using the BASIC rather than the ENHANCED mode.

Only subjects with nonmissing spine and whole body BMD at baseline were included in the spine and whole body DXA analysis sets, respectively.

In the TDF group, based on the observed data, none of the evaluable subjects had a spine or whole body BMD Z-score &lt; -2 at baseline, and no subjects had a decrease in spine or whole body BMD Z-score to &lt; -2 at Week 48. Two subjects with whole body Z-scores &lt; -2 at Week 48 were captured as 'missing' in the shift tables, as they did not have whole body Z-scores at baseline. In the Placebo group, 2 subjects had a spine BMD Z-score &lt; -2 and 1 subject had a whole body BMD Z-score &lt; -2 at baseline. BMD Z-score categories improved for these subjects during treatment.

## Relationship between Bone Mineral Density and Renal Laboratory Parameters

To  address  a  post-marketing  requirement  of  the  FDA  relating  to  the  further  investigation  whether changes in bone mineral density observed with TDF are secondary to renal phosphate excretion or effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on bone, the MAH evaluated in this study the relationship between select renal biomarkers (i.e serum and urine  creatinine  and  phosphate  (fasting  and  non-fasting);  calculated  eGFR  (CLcr)  by  the  Schwartz formula and TmP to eGFR and changes from baseline in spine and whole body BMD at Week 48.

Cross-sectional correlations between renal parameters and spine and whole body BMD at baseline and Week 48 were also evaluated. Both analyses were supplemented with exploratory tests for interactions of treatment and renal parameters with spine or whole body BMD as response.

Change from baseline in TmP/GFR and change from baseline in fasting serum phosphate were both negatively associated with percent change from baseline in whole body BMD at Week 48, both across and within  treatment  groups.  Treatment  (TDF  or  placebo)  had  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  the magnitude  of  these  associations.  No  other  consistently  significant  associations  or  interactions  with treatment were observed for change from baseline in renal parameters and percent change from baseline in spine or whole body BMD at Week 48.

Serum creatinine was positively associated with spine and whole body BMD at baseline and Week 48 when the analysis included all subjects (i.e., across groups) and when the analysis was conducted by treatment group. Treatment with TDF decreased the magnitude of the positive association between serum creatinine and spine and whole body BMD at Week 48 compared with placebo.

The MAH concludes that the clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. During 48 weeks of treatment with TDF, changes in BMD did not appear to be clinically related to changes in renal parameters in this population of paediatric CHB subjects.

## Laboratory findings

A total of 58 subjects in the TDF group (96.7%) and 29 subjects in the Placebo group (100.0%) had at least 1 graded laboratory abnormality. For the majority of subjects in each treatment group, the highest grade laboratory abnormality was Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate): 55.0% of subjects in the TDF group and 55.2% of subjects in the Placebo group. Grade 3 (severe) was the highest grade laboratory abnormality for 19.0% of subjects in the TDF group and 24.1% of subjects in the Placebo group. Seven subjects (12.1%) in the TDF group and 4 subjects (13.8%) in the Placebo group had a Grade 4 (life threatening) laboratory abnormality.

The following table presents Grade 3 and 4 chemistry and coagulation laboratory abnormalities that were reported for &gt; 5% of subjects in either treatment group.

## ALT flares and exacerbation of hepatitis

ALT flare and exacerbation of hepatitis were evaluated during the double-blind treatment phase according to the following criteria:

- -ALT &gt; 2 x study baseline and &gt; 10 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), with or without associated symptoms
- -
- Confirmed ALT elevation (defined as 1 grade increase or 2  p r e v io u s changes outside of the normal range in other laboratory parameters suggestive of worsening hepatic function (i.e., abnormal prothrombin time ≥ 2 seconds greater than study baseline; INR ≥ 0.5 over study baseline, abnormal serum albumin ≥ 1 g/dL below study baseline, or elevated

serum lactate ≥ 2 x ULN).

During double-blind treatment, 5 subjects (8.3%) in the TDF group and 1 subject (3.4%) in the Placebo group (none of whom had prior HBV treatment experience) met the first criterion for ALT flare and exacerbation of hepatitis (i.e., ALT &gt; 2 x study baseline and &gt; 10 x ULN, with or without associated symptoms). No subjects in either group met Criterion 2 for ALT flare a,d exacerbation of hepatitis (second bullet).

The MAH states that all of the above five subjects with ALT flares had graded elevations in ALT at baseline. Total bilirubin values remained normal for all subjects with ALT flare and no subjects with ALT flare had increases in HBV DNA; and all remained HBsAg positive.

No subjects in the TDF group experienced off-treatment ALT flare or exacerbation of hepatitis.

## Body Weight and Height

Body weight Z-scores were similar for the TDF and Placebo groups at baseline. During double-blind treatment, Z-scores decreased slightly for the TDF group and increased slightly for the Placebo group, with mean (SD) changes of -0.061 (0.3876) for the TDF group and +0.259 (0.5080) for the Placebo group at Week 48 (p = 0.005).

Height Z-scores were similar for the TDF and Placebo groups at baseline. During double-blind treatment, Z-scores decreased slightly for both groups, with mean (SD) changes of -0.171 (0.4048) for the TDF group and -0.115 (0.4408) for the Placebo group at Week 48.

## Tanner staging

As expected for the study population of 2- to 12-year-olds, the majority of males and females in both treatment groups were categorised at Tanner Stage 1(prepubertal) at enrolment for each category (male genitalia size and lack of pubic hair and female breast size and lack of pubic hair), and most of the subjects remained at Tanner Stage 1 at Week 48.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

No subjects prematurely discontinued TDF due to AEs. Two subjects prematurely discontinued placebo due to AEs: 1 subject due to hypoglycaemia, and 1 subject due to increased ALT

## Post-marketing experience

No post-marketing data are submitted with this application.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Safety data derived from this study pertains to 60 TDF treated subjects with HBV infection aged from 2 to 12 years of age and to 29 subjects of the same age category having received placebo in a double blind manner for 48 weeks.

The safety profile of TDF in this study is overall similar to what was reported so far in already approved paediatric indication, i.e. in HBV-infected adolescents aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years and in HIV-1 infected children aged from 2 to &lt; 18 years. The main safety concerns are those, already identified for TDF, namely its impact on renal function and bone loss.

Regarding renal safety, as already seen previously with TDF, an impact of TDF on creatinine clearance is observed. A greater decrease in mean eGFR from baseline was observed at week 48 in TDF-treated patients (-8.7mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared with those who received placebo (-0.09 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Two TDF-treated subjects experienced eGFR below 70mL/min/1.73m 2  during the double blind period but no information has been provided by the MAH, and whether additional subjects had lesser decrease i.e. comprised between 70 and 90mL/min/1.73m 2 . No serious renal AEs related to TDF have been reported in this study and no AEs of proximal renal tubulopathy were notified during the study. As a reminder, decrease was more pronounced in the youngest children in study 352 in HIV indication.

Regarding bone safety, two AEs of bone density decreased and osteopenia have been considered as related to TDF by the investigator. However, none were classified serious and none led to interruption or discontinuation to study drug. While spine and total BMD increased from baseline to week 48 in both

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment groups, smaller percent increases were reported for TDF group compared with placebo group. TDF-treated subjects also had higher decrease in mean BMD Z-scores than placebo-treated subjects at week  48,  even  though  these  Z-score  remained  within  normal  values  for  this  patient  population throughout the study. Overall, these changes in Z-scores remain limited and of unclear significance. More worrisome is the higher cumulative incidence of decrease &gt; 4% in spine and total body BMD reported in TDF group (18.3% and 6.7% respectively) versus placebo group (6.9% versus 0 respectively) even the difference was reported to be not statistically significant.

As previously and extensively discussed at the time of the MAA Application for the HIV-1 indication in paediatric population, these data also raise concerns on the long term impact of TDF in bone metabolism in this vulnerable population of patients of active modelling process, triggering the input of a SAG. Taking into the SAG advice, the extension of indication of Viread in HIV-1 infected children &gt; 2 years of age was approved by the CHMP taking into account notably the fact that there is no clear correlation between BMD decrease and clinical event and that the long term bone effects may thus be considered as theoretical while there are established benefits in this population in need of treatment. In parallel the SmPC of Viread was revised to include warnings to alert physicians, notably on the uncertainties on the long term effect of bone and renal toxicity.

In September, the provision of the long term 336 week data from study 352 in HIV-1infected children was assessed at CHMP level. Data are very limited to assess long term bone safety as only few patients were evaluated but the available data were overall rather reassuring showing that decreases in BMD Z-score (spine, Total Body and Total Body Less Head) observed during the first years of therapy were not progressive over time and seemed to be stabilised. Concerns were rather raised on the evolution of patients'  renal  function  over  time,  however  difficulties  in  the  interpretation  of  evolution  of  eGFR  in growing children with the Schwartz formulae were acknowledged. Finally, section 4.8 was updated to provide safety information on children who achieved eGFR &lt; 70mL/min/1.73m 2  while on long term TDF therapy.

More recently, the final results of the DUS GS-EU-174-0224 to assess physicians prescribing Viread to paediatric HBV infected patients in the EU were following the recommendations in the Viread SmPC and renal educational brochures were assessed within the type II variation II/188. Despite a low response rate, and acknowledged difficulties for interpreting and generalising study results, the final data show that a majority of physicians adhere to SmPC recommendations with regard to regular monitoring for renal and bone toxicity and consultation with specialists in case where renal or bone abnormalities are observed.

Given the above considerations, the current VIREAD SmPC and the current renal educational that have been maintained in the RMP in the perspective of this indication extension are considered sufficiently informative to alert physicians on the impact of TDF on bone and renal function and to provide appropriate recommendations for the management of these safety risks.

The final week 192 data of the current study in HBV infected children will have to be provided to further substantiate the long term renal and bone safety profile of TDF in this vulnerable population of patients.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of TDF in HBV infected children aged 2 to &lt; 12 years derived from the 48 week data of study GS-US-174-0144 is overall similar to what have been previously reported in the already approved paediatric indication of TDF. Renal and bone safety remain the most salient safety issues for TDF. The long term available study results in HIV-1 infected children recently assessed at CHMP level could not allow to fully dispel the concerns as regards the uncertainties on the long term impact of TDF on renal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

function and bone mineralisation in the paediatric population, due to difficulties in interpretation and low effective. This long term concern still remain.

The Viread SmPC is currently reflecting these uncertainties and provides relevant recommendations for managing  the  renal  and  bone  risks.  The  RMP  still  plans  renal  educational  brochure  for  paediatric population as risk minimisation measures and includes the provision of final week 192 data from study GS-US-174-0144 to further help at substantiating the long term safety impact of TDF in HBV infected children.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC for Viread 123 mg, 163 mg and 204 mg film-coated tablets and for Viread granules 33 mg/g have been updated to reflect the indication of CHB in paediatric patients. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have also been updated for Viread 245 mg. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated accordingly.

In addition, a discrepancy in the PI regarding the recommendation pertaining to pregnancy was corrected, by aligning the PL wording with that of the SmPC.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

Readability testing (user consultation) for Viread 123 mg, 163 mg, 204 mg and 245 mg tablets and Viread 33 mg/g oral granules has previously been conducted using the English language version of the package leaflets by Consumation Consumer Information Design. The proposed updates to the package leaflets to extend the indication to include paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years of age do not alter the readability of the leaflets and therefore additional testing is not considered necessary.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

Recent reports estimate that 250 to 350 million individuals were living with HBV (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive) in 2010, representing a worldwide prevalence of 3.6%, with considerable geographic variability. In 2013, an estimated 686,000 deaths were due to HBV infection and associated complications, placing it among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide.

Universal HBV vaccination and blood-donor screening have markedly reduced the rate of chronic infection including in Europe. However, a significant number of children are still infected each year. In Europe, prevalence remains elevated in some European areas (notably in Eastern and Southern Europe) and paediatricians are confronted with an increasing number of children adopted from higher prevalence countries.

Following acute HBV infection, the risk of developing chronic infection varies inversely with age. Chronic HBV infection occurs among about 90% of infants infected at birth, 25 to 50% of children infected at 1 to 5 years of age, and about 5 to 10% of persons infected as teens and adults.

Although most children with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic and severe liver disease during childhood is rare, children are at risk for developing serious complications later in life, notably cirrhosis and HCC. In addition, HBV carriers can transmit the disease for many years.

Chronic HBV infection is characterised by different phases of infection:

1) the immune tolerant phase, with markedly elevated levels of HBV DNA, detectable HBsAg and HBV e antigen (HBeAg), and normal or low levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT);

2) the immune active phase, characterised by elevated levels of HBV DNA with persistently elevated ALT, an indicator of ongoing liver damage;

3) the inactive HBsAg carrier phase, with undetectable or low levels of HBV DNA and the presence of anti-HBe antibodies; and

4) the reactivation phase, characterised by HBeAg seronegativity (and anti-HBe seropositivity) but with elevated HBV DNA levels and abnormal ALT.

Management of CHB in children and adolescents is evolving and optimal treatment is not well established. The current consensus is that no treatment is indicated for HBV-infected children in the immune tolerant or inactive HBsAg carrier phases (AASLD 2018, EASL 2017). However, treatment may be warranted for children  in  the  immune  active  or  reactivation  phases  to  suppress  viral  replication  and  prevent complications and poor clinical outcomes, including cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and HCC. Indeed, studies in adults suggest that a prolonged period of time in the immune active phase is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC.

As mentioned in the ESPGHAN clinical practice guidelines (Sokal et al. J of Heatology 2013), for all patients, the ideal end point of treatment is sustained HBsAg clearance, as it stops disease progression and  reduces  the  risk  of  HCC,  although  it  occurs  in  a  minority  of  treated  subjects.  When  HBsAg seroclearance is not achieved, sustained off-therapy suppression of viral replication (undetectable HBV DNA levels with a sensitive real time polymerase chain reaction assay), associated with durable anti-HBe seroconversion in originally HBeAg-positive patients, is a good end point, being associated with improved prognosis, including decreased risk of HCC. In the absence of off-therapy viral suppression, undetectable HBV DNA under long-term antiviral therapy (maintained virological response) is the next desirable end point. Reduction of viremia levels leads to decreased liver inflammation and subsequent normalisation of ALT levels, reducing the risk of disease progression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.1. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Currently, there are two main treatment options for CHB patients: treatment with oral antiviral agents or with IFNa, currently pegylated interferon alfa-2a. The rationale for a PegIFNa based approach is to induce long-term  immunological  control  with  a  finite  duration  treatment  (EASL  2017);  however,  pegIFN  is associated with important safety and tolerability issues. Entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are potent inhibitors of HBV replication with a high barrier to resistance, and these 3 agents are recommended as preferred monotherapies for CHB in adults regardless of the severity of liver disease (EASL 2017).

Entecavir, TDF and TAF as well as peginterferon alfa-2a are currently approved for use in CHB-infected adolescents in Europe. In children, only entecavir is approved for paediatric patients (from 2 years of age) and Pegasys (from 3 years of age). A study is ongoing with TAF in paediatric patients &lt;12 y.o.

Thus, TDF represents a new treatment option for children 2 to &lt; 12 years old. Given its potent antiviral activity in CHB, including patients with resistance to other oral antivirals, such as LAM and ETV, TDF would become a standard of care (with entecavir) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in children in need for treatment. To be noted that entecavir is only approved for use in nucleoside naive children while TDF could be use also in treatment-experienced children.

## 3.1.2. Main clinical studies

The application relies on the submission of the 48 weeks results of study GS-US-174-0144. The dose used in this study was the dose previously approved for use in HIV-infected children.

This study is an ongoing Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study that is evaluating the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of TDF versus Placebo in paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years with chronic hepatitis B infection.

The study was initiated in December 2012 and was primarily conducted in Asia and North America/Europe (the EU centres being in Romania and Bulgaria). At the time of the study initiation, entecavir was not yet approved in children and the study was designed as a placebo controlled study. The study therefore compared TDF and placebo over 48 weeks, at which time children from the placebo arm could switch to open-label TDF (until Week 192).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

As expected, a striking superiority  of  TDF  over  placebo  was  demonstrated  on  the  primary  endpoint (proportion of patients with HBV DNA &lt;69 IU/ml, equivalent to &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 48): 76.7% vs 6.9%; p&lt;0.001.

Biochemical response was also significantly higher in the TDF arm: 65.5% vs 14.8% at Week 48 by central laboratory criteria, p &lt; 0.001; 51.7% vs 17.9% by AASLD criterion, p = 0.002.

Similarly  to  adults,  TDF  seems  to  have  a  high  genetic  barrier  in  children  as  no  patients  had  TDF resistance-associated mutation through week 48 in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

To select a paediatric population with immune-active disease, children should have ALT&gt;1.5 ULN at screening.  The  cut-off  was  chosen  based  on  recommendation  from  US  experts  panel  and  ESPGHAN guidelines. However, while US and EU experts recommends ALT should be persistently elevated (&gt;1.5 ULN on at least 2 occasions over 6 months), children were eligible in the study if ALT were &gt;1.5 ULN at screening without confirmation required. Therefore, whether all paediatric patients included in this study were in active immune phase is questionable, all the more there was no biopsy requirement in this study.

Contrarily to the study in HBV-infected adolescent, for which 85% of patients had prior exposure to anti-HBV agents, the majority of children were treatment naïve in this study. Of note, a significantly higher proportion of patients having received prior HBV treatment in the Placebo group (41.4% versus 16.7% in the Viread group). Moreover, all but 4 children had HBeAg+ disease. Although sample size were small, treatment response to TDF did not differ according to prior treatment status or HBeAg status in this study. The MAH applies for an unqualified (large) indication, which is acceptable when considering the efficacy of tenofovir in adults is regarded as established in both HBeAg+ and HBeAg- disease and prior exposure to anti-HBV agents did not impact response to TDF in adults and adolescents.

The primary objective of the study is to confirm the antiviral efficacy of Viread in children as a surrogate of the clinical benefit of the drug. The association between viral suppression and reduction of the risk of progression of liver disease is less documented in paediatric patients. Nevertheless, durable suppression of viral replication is acknowledged to be an appropriate marker in children.

As  previously  raised  for  adolescents  and  for  adults,  the  superior  virological  potency  of  TDF  did  not translate  into  a  superior  rate  of  HBeAg  seroconversion.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  rate  of  HBeAg seroconversion was similar in the TDF and the placebo arm at W48, and was around 25%. This implies there is a need for long-term treatment for a majority of children.

A  similar  very  low  proportion  of  patients  (3%)  achieved  HBsAg  loss  and  no  patients  achieved  HBs seroconversion.

Patients with high ALT level (&gt;2N) at baseline had notably greater rate of response as compared to patients who had ALT &lt;2 N at baseline. The difference is no longer observed when cut-off for ALT is 1.5 N. Response rate was higher in children aged &gt;6 y.o as compared to younger children (15/22, 68% versus 34/38, 89.5%; updated analysis). While treatment response in subgroups combining ALT and age categories were provided, those results are difficult to interpret given the small sample size and no clear trend can be retrieved from those data.

A finding for a numerically lower response rate in genotype D, most common in Europe, as compared to other genotypes (54% versus 75-100%) was also found.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

Safety data derived from this study pertains to 60 TDF treated subjects with HBV infection aged from 2 to 12 years of age and to 29 subjects of the same age category having received placebo in a double blind manner for 48 weeks.

The safety profile of TDF in this study is overall similar to what was reported so far in already approved paediatric indication, i.e in HBV-infected adolescents aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years and in HIV-1 infected children aged from 2 to &lt; 18 years. The main safety concerns are those, already identified for TDF, namely its impact on renal function and bone loss.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding renal safety, as already seen previously with TDF, an impact of TDF on creatinine clearance is observed. A greater decrease in mean eGFR from baseline was observed at week 48 in TDF-treated patients (-8.7mL/min/1.73m 2 ) compared with those who received placebo (-0.09 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). The magnitude of the decrease in TDF-treated children was more pronounced in the youngest children the decrease in renal function with TDF therapy was more pronounced in the youngest category (-17.97 mL/min /1.73m 2  for subjects between 2 and 6 years of age versus -5.60 mL/min/1.73m 2  for subjects between 6 and 12 years of age at week 48). Similar differential was previously reported in the study 352 in HIV infected children. Three TDF-treated subjects experienced eGFR below 70mL/min/1.73m 2  during the double blind period but the decrease in eGFR in these patients was transient and not associated with laboratory abnormalities that could speak in favour of tubular damage. No serious renal AEs related to TDF have been reported in this study and no AEs of proximal renal tubulopathy were notified during the study nor infraclinical PRT.

Regarding bone safety, two AEs of bone density decreased and osteopenia have been considered as related to TDF by the investigator. However, none were classified serious and none led to interruption or discontinuation to study drug. While spine and total BMD increased from baseline to week 48 in both treatment groups, smaller percent increases were consistently reported for TDF group compared with placebo group whatever the age category (2 to &lt;6 years or 6 to &lt; 12 years). For both spine and whole body BMD the magnitude of the mean percentage increases in the TDF and Placebo groups was greater in the younger compared with the older age group.

TDF-treated subjects also had higher decrease in mean BMD Z-scores than placebo-treated subjects at week  48,  even  though  these  Z-score  remained  within  normal  values  for  this  patient  population throughout the study. Overall, these changes in Z-scores remain limited and of unclear significance. More worrisome is the higher cumulative incidence of decrease &gt; 4% in spine and total body BMD reported in TDF group (18.3% and 6.7% respectively) versus placebo group (6.9% versus 0 respectively) even the difference was reported to be not statistically significant.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Renal and bone safety remain the most salient safety issues for TDF. The long term available study results in HIV-1 infected children recently assessed at CHMP level could not allow to fully dispel the concerns as regards the uncertainties on the long term impact of TDF on renal function and bone mineralisation in the paediatric  population,  due  to  difficulties  in  interpretation  and  low  effective.  The  potential  long-term toxicities of Viread in paediatric patients are not known.

Finally,  unnecessary  early  therapy  with  nucleoside  analog  can  result  in  development  of  resistance, thereby limiting treatment option later in life.

## 3.6. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

Although most children with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic and severe liver disease during childhood is rare, it is acknowledged that some children are at risk for developing serious complications later in life, notably cirrhosis and HCC. Thus, current clinical guidelines consider that no treatment is indicated for HBV-infected children in the immune tolerant or inactive HBsAg carrier phases but treatment may be warranted for children in the immune active or reactivation phases to suppress viral replication and prevent complications and poor clinical outcomes, including cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and HCC.

This approach has already been discussed and agreed upon at the time of the approval of entecavir in paediatric patients from 2 to &lt;18 years of age. Considering that entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are recommended as preferred monotherapies for CHB in adults, there is no obvious reason that this will not be the case in paediatric patients. To be noted that use of TAF in paediatric patients &lt;12 y.o. is currently explored in an ongoing study.

Moreover, while entecavir is only approved for use in nucleoside naive children, TDF could be use also in treatment-experienced children given its antiviral activity is maintained in patients with resistance to other oral antivirals, such as LAM and ETV.

The MAH has shown the exposure of HBV-infected children with the 8mg/kg dose was similar to the exposure previously reported in HIV paediatric population of the same age receiving the same dose of TDF. Moreover, the formulation proposed to be used in HBV-infected children are the same than those already approved for use in HIV-infected children, i.e. low-strength Viread tablets (123 mg; 163 mg; 204 mg) and Viread 33mg/kg granules.

Viread has been shown to supress viral replication in paediatric patients in study GS-US-174-0144 (n=60 receiving Viread). Even though the association between viral suppression and reduction of the risk of progression of liver disease is less documented in paediatric patients, the clinical benefit of durable suppression of viral replication has been shown in adults.

The majority of children in this study were treatment naïve (83%) and all but 4 children had HBeAg+ disease. The MAH nevertheless applies for an unqualified (large) indication, which is acceptable when considering the efficacy of tenofovir in adults is regarded as established in both HBeAg+ and HBeAgdisease and prior exposure to anti-HBV agents did not impact response to TDF in adults and adolescents.

The salient aspects of the safety profile of Viread remain the renal and bone safety, which may be of particular concern for the vulnerable population of paediatric patients in active modelling process. This issue has already been extensively discussed during the approval of Viread in HIV-infected children with involvement of a SAG. Even though the uncertainties on the long term impact of TDF on renal function and bone mineralisation in the paediatric population could not be dispel, it was concluded that in absence of  a  clear  correlation  between  BMD  decrease and  clinical  event,  the  long  term  bone  effects  may  be considered as theoretical while there are established benefits in this population in need of treatment. The SmPC of Viread has been reinforced with warning to alert physicians on the impact of TDF on bone and renal function and to provide appropriate recommendations for the management of these safety risks. Moreover, there is a specific renal educational dedicated to paediatric patients.

The same approach can apply for HBV-infected paediatric patients.

Overall, the CHMP is of the view that the attention should be paid that the indication and warning in the SmPC should prevent going beyond a population in immediate need for treatment. This is all the more important  that,  unnecessary  early  therapy  with  nucleoside  analog  can  result  in  development  of resistance, thereby limiting treatment option later in life. In line with the CHMP proposal, the indication now selects for a paediatric population with immune active disease and a warning was added in the SmPC to encourage the prescribers to cautiously weigh the benefit and risks when deciding to initiate treatment in  paediatric  patients  from  2  years  of  age.  It  was  agreed  at  the  CHMP  level  to  make  optional  the requirement for histological evidence in the indication, acknowledging biopsy is not universally performed and considering section 4.4 will call for a particular weighing of the decision to treat.

The CHMP considers essential that the relatively rare cases of children with need for HBV treatment are managed and monitored for bone and renal toxicity at specialised centres.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication based on results from interim Week 48 clinical study report (CSR) for Study GS-US-174-0144;  a  'Randomized,  Double-Blind  Evaluation  of  the  Antiviral  Efficacy,  Safety  and Tolerability of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Versus Placebo in Pediatric Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection', resulting in the following changes:

- 1) Viread 123 mg, 163 mg and 204 mg film coated tablets: new chronic hepatitis B (CHB) indication to include treatment of CHB in paediatric patients aged 6 to &lt; 12 years, update of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC.
- 2) Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets, update of Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.
- 3) Viread granules 33 mg/g: extension of the existing CHB indication to include treatment of CHB in paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt; 12 years, update of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly for all formulations.

In  addition,  a  discrepancy  in  the  PI  regarding  the  recommendation  pertaining  to  pregnancy  was corrected, by aligning the PL wording with that of the SmPC.

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) submitted a revised RMP version 24.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk management plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## Additional risk minimisation measures

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to prescribe/use Viread in paediatric patients are provided with a physician educational pack containing the Summary of Product Characteristics and an appropriate educational brochure, as detailed below:

- HIV paediatric educational brochure
- HBV paediatric educational brochure

The HIV and HBV paediatric educational brochures should contain the following key messages:

- That a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of paediatric patients
- That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV and HBV infected patients associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Viread
- That Viread is not recommended for use in paediatric patients with renal impairment
- That use of Viread should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. If Viread is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely monitored according to the recommended schedule
- That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating Viread therapy
- The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Viread therapy
- Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of additional risk factors for renal impairment
- That if serum phosphate is confirmed to be &lt; 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week. If renal abnormalities are detected or suspected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to consider interruption of Viread treatment. Interrupting treatment with Viread should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.
- That Viread may cause a reduction in BMD and the effects of Viread associated changes in BMD on long term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown in paediatric patients
- That if bone abnormalities are detected or suspected then consultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0262/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
