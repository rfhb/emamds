Study WI203581 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, European, multi-cohort, open-label study in pediatric patients (≥1 and &lt;18 years of age) with R /R CD22-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); and study WI235086 is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability of InO in Japanese pediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 2.0 has also been submitted.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

With the current variation, the MAH proposes paediatric updates to the Besponsa SmPC, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. These changes are supported by an updated discussion of the results of Study ITCC059, which was previously submitted (March 17, 2023) and discussed within procedure EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004. Further, the MAH presents data from Study INO-Ped-ALL-1, which is a Phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability of InO in Japanese paediatric patients. Specifically, PK data from 6 paediatric patients included in study INO-Ped-ALL-1 is used to support SmPC updates on PK. An updated RMP has also been submitted.

The objectives of Study ITCC-059 were to identify the recommended dose of InO either as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B) for paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL, and to estimate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the selected recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of monotherapy InO (Phase 2), and to evaluate PK and PD in this patient population. As monotherapy data only are proposed for inclusion in the SmPC, only the monotherapy portions of the study are considered in this variation assessment report.

In the dose-finding portion of Study ITCC-059, the RP2D of InO as monotherapy in paediatric patients was 1.8 mg/m2 in Cycle 1. This is the same dose as recommended for adult patients in Cycle 1. The exposure in paediatric patients was slightly higher than in adults given the same dose, based on the population PK (popPK) analysis.

In the dose-finding portion of the study, including 20 evaluable subjects, the ORR after InO monotherapy (both dose levels combined) was 80% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7). In the Phase 2 portion of the study, including 28 subjects, the ORR after InO monotherapy (1.8 mg/m2 in the first cycle) was 78.6% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7).

DoR was 8.0 months (95% CI: 3.9-13.9) and 7.6 months (95% CI: 3.3-NE) in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In stratum 1A, eight (32.0%) participants had post InO allogeneic HSCT transplants. All were in CR at the time of HSCT. A total of 4 (16.0%) participants in Stratum 1A underwent at least 1 CAR T-cell therapy given after end of study therapy or after last dose of InO. In the Phase 2 Cohort, 18 (64.3%) participants had post InO allogeneic HSCT transplants. Seventeen of 18 participants were in CR/CRi/CRp at the time of HSCT. A total of 9 (32.1%) participants in Phase 2 Cohort underwent at least 1 CAR T-cell therapy given after end of study therapy or after last dose of InO.

The MAH suggests describing the ORR and DoR results in section 5.1 of the SmPC, which is largely accepted. The efficacy information should include how many subjects had subsequent HSCT, as this is relevant for the data on duration of response.

The safety database from Study ITCC-059 consists of 25 (Phase I) + 28 (Phase II), i.e. 53 paediatric patients treated with InO monotherapy. The subjects were acceptably evenly distributed over the paediatric age range, with 12 subjects &lt; 6 years, 20 subjects 6 to &lt; 12 years and 21 subjects 12 to &lt;18 years old.

The median number of cycles administered was two (2) for InO monotherapy.

The safety profile for InO in paediatric patients was generally manageable. In monotherapy, the most frequently reported TEAEs were pyrexia, vomiting, anaemia and decreased platelet count. Thus, as previously reported in adults, TEAEs were most commonly reported within SOCs Blood and lymphatic disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. Dose-limiting toxicity as evaluated in Cycle 1 of the dose-finding portion of the study included ALT increased, decreased platelet count, and decreased neutrophil count.

An increased risk for veno-occlusive disease (VOD), above the risk of standard chemotherapy, has been observed in adult patients treated with InO. This risk is most marked in patients who undergo subsequent HSCT, and in particular patients who receive a conditioning regimen containing two alkylating agents. In the pivotal registration study in adults, VOD was reported in 14% of the patients. In 3% of the patients, the event was not associated with HSCT. In the paediatric Study ITCC-059, VODs were reported in 8/53 patients (15.1%) after InO monotherapy. Thus, the VOD rate in this study was in the same range as that previously reported in adults. Five of the 8 VOD events occurred after HSCT. As in adults, VOD was more commonly reported in paediatric subjects with hepatic dysfunction (5 events) than in subjects with normal hepatic function (3 events). This was even more evident in patients undergoing subsequent HSCT (1 event in a subject with normal hepatic function and 4 events in subjects with hepatic impairment). Risk factors for VOD are well described in the SmPC. The MAH proposes to describe the paediatric VOD rate in the SmPC which is adequate.

As the paediatric indication investigated in Study ITCC-059 is the same as that approved in adults, the paediatric safety data is described in section 4.8 of the SmPC, in line with the Q&amp;A document Revision 1 - Frequently asked questions on SmPC paediatric information (europa.eu) .

Given the limited paediatric efficacy and safety data available, the proposed standard text in section 4.2, i.e.: 'Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made' is considered adequate.

The variation is recommended for approval.

The benefit/risk of InO in the approved indication remains unchanged.

## Annex: Rapporteur's assessment comments on the type II variation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Introduction

Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO, BESPONSA) is an ADC, with CD22-directed humanized immunoglobulin type G, subtype 4 antibody covalently linked to N-Acγ -calichaemicin dimethylhydrazide, a potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, approved for adult patients with R/R BCP-ALL. InO causes cell death by inducing double-strand DNA breaks.2,3 CD22 is a B-cell adhesion molecule that is expressed on both normal cells of the mature B-lymphocyte lineage and on the malignant cells of the majority of B-cell cancers. It is highly expressed in more than 90% cases of childhood BCP-ALL.

To date, approvals of InO for treatment for adults with R/R ALL have been granted in the US (on 17 August 2017, the EU (on 29 June 2017), Switzerland (10 July 2017), and Japan (19 January 2018).

The approved indication in the EU is:

BESPONSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+ ) relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)

On March 17 th , the MAH submitted the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for study ITCC-059 for inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, to fulfil the requirement to report paediatric data within 6 months of primary completion date (PCD). This CSR was discussed within procedure EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004. No amendments to the SmPC or RMP were then proposed.

With the current variation application, the MAH submitted an updated discussion of the results of Study ITCC-059 to add additional safety information that were not available at the time of the previous Article 46 submission. Further, the MAH presents data from Study INO-Ped-ALL-1, which is a Phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability of InO in Japanese paediatric patients. Specifically, PK data from 6 paediatric patients included in study INO-Ped-ALL-1 is used to support product information updates on PK.

With the current variation, the MAH proposes paediatric updates to the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, supported by the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity data from single agent cohorts and population PK results from Study ITCC-059 and Study INO-Ped-ALL-1.

A Clinical Overview and Clinical Summaries have been provided discussing the paediatric data supporting the proposed SmPC updates.

Further, the MAH submitted the final CSR for a non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) of InO to characterise complications post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following InO Treatment in adult and pediatric patients with B-cell precursor ALL. This was included in the EU RMP, under Part III. Pharmacovigilance Plan, Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities (EU Post Authorization Study (PAS) register number - EUPAS23056). This non-interventional study was designated as a post-authorization safety study (PASS) and was a commitment to post-marketing requirement (PMR 3259-1) by the FDA.

An updated RMP has also been submitted.

The proposed SmPC updates are outlined in Section 10 below and in the appended, annotated Product information.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

The design and PK data from Study ITCC-059 (WI203581) which was a Phase 1/2, multicenter, European, multi-cohort, openlabel study in paediatric patients (≥1 and &lt;18 years of age) with R/R CD22-positive ALL have been previously described in EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004 and have been included in the popPK analysis, see below. The data is also summarised in Table 2 for the 1.8 mg/m2 dose.

Study INO-Ped-ALL-1 (WI235086): A Phase I Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin as a Single Agent for Paediatric Patients in Japan with Relapsed/Refractory CD22-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

This was a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study to with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of InO in Japanese patients aged 1-17 with R/R CD22-positive ALL. Evaluation of PK and preliminary efficacy were secondary objectives.

A total of seven patients were enrolled (thereof one screen failure). Data is available for 6 patients. The six included patients were aged 2-17 years, weighed 9.3 to 53 kg, had a BSA of 0.47 to 1.53 m 2 , and 50% of patients were female.

Three dose levels were defined in the protocol; however, all patients were given the same dosing regimen, which is also identical with the adult regimen. At cycle 1, the InO dose was 1.8 mg/m2 and was fractionated D1, 8 and 15: 0.8, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/m2. For the second cycle, the dose was 1 mg/m2 fractionated in 3x 0.5 mg/m2, unless patients did not achieve CR/CRi, in which case the same dose regimen as the first cycle was given. Of 6 subjects in the per protocol set, 5 subjects achieved CR or Cri and were dosed accordingly.

Blood samples for PK and ADA were to be collected from all participants for analysis according to the protocol specified schedules. Bioanalysis of InO (substance code PF-05208773) and the cytotoxic moiety N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide using LC/MS-MS was conducted at PPD using previously validated methods (B1939001 and A9016002, respectively). For InO, it is an indirect analytical method using N-acetyl-epsilon-calicheamicin after several sample workup steps as a surrogate for inotuzumab ozogamicin.

The within study validations showed performance within pre-set criteria, samples were measured within established long-term stability and ISR was performed for InO, where 20/21 samples were within 30%.

For antidrug antibodies (ADA), the previously validated and assessed method B1937005 was used, including a population specific cutpoint for ALL.

## Assessor's comment:

The validations of both methods were found acceptable at the time of the initial MAA. Within study validation showed adequate performance of the methods.

According to the ICH M10 bioanalysis guideline, 20% and not 30% is to be applied for ISR for LCMS/MS based methods. Two additional samples did not fall within 20%, however it is still more than 2/3 of samples that passed ISR. As this study does not formally require an ISR, the issue is not pursued.

A summary of InO serum concentrations by visit and time for the PK analysis set (n=6) is provided in Table 12. The data has also been included in the popPK analysis. Mean peak serum InO concentrations were observed at the end of infusion (1-hour post-dose) with a peak mean concentration of 330 ng/mL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by Cycle 1 Day 1. There was no clear trend for trough serum InO concentrations increasing after cycle 1. Overall, the InO serum exposures in paediatric patients with ALL were similar to those previously reported in adult patients with ALL (Table 23).

Serum concentrations for N-acetylgamma calicheamicin DMH were &lt; LLOQ for all tested samples.

Summary statistics have been calculated by setting concentration values below the LLOQ to zero. The LLOQ was 1.00 ng/mL.

Amongst InO single agent treated participants, none had ADA positive results.

A summary of InO serum concentrations by visit and time following 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle in adult and paediatric patients with B-cell ALL is provided in Table 23. InO serum concentrations in paediatric patients with ALL administered as 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle dosing regimen were generally comparable to those in adult patients with ALL administered as the same dosing regimen.

Only concentration data collected at the same time points in at least 2 studies are shown. Summary statistics have been calculated by setting concentration values below the LLOQ to zero. The LLOQ was 1.00 ng/mL.

## Pop PK analysis

A pop PK analysis (PMAR-EQDD-B193e-DP4-1490) was conducted using NONMEM to characterize the PK of InO in paediatric patients with R/R ALL and to compare InO PK between adult and paediatric patients with R/R ALL.

The current popPK analysis was conducted based on pooled data (N = 824, previously n = 765 adults) adding 2 studies in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (n = 59) from Japan (n = 6) and global (n = 53) to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of inotuzumab ozogamicin in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Of the 8978 observations, 3397 (37.8%) observations were &lt; LLOQ, with the majority of the data &lt; LLOQ originating from the NHL studies, and the M3 method was used. In pae diatric patients, 0.8% were &lt; LLOQ. The model developed previously for adults with NHL or ALL re-estimated on the updated dataset (including paediatric data) was used as base model and was found of adequate structure (2-compartment popPK model with both linear and time-dependent clearance) to characterize InO PK in paediatric patients.

In the previous analysis in adults, significant covariates included baseline body surface area (BBSA) on linear clearance (CL1), clearance associated with time-dependent clearance (CL2), and volume of distribution in central compartment (V1); disease and/or bioanalytical assay method (PTST) on CL1 and decay coefficient associated with time-dependent clearance (kdes); inotuzumab ozogamicin administered with rituximab (RITX) on CL1; and baseline percent of blasts in peripheral blood (BLSTPB) on kdes. No other significant covariates were identified.

In this analysis, covariates were added to the base model (Table 3) sequentially in a stepwise addition manner. The model resulting from the forward selection algorithm was subjected to a backward elimination algorithm using likelihood ratio tests (based on ∆OFV) to assess the significance of the covariate parameters in the model when excluded one at a time.

There were no strong correlations identified based on the visual inspection of the base model ETAs versus covariate plots, except for one identified trend which kdes tended to be higher in paediatric patients with ALL compared to adult patients with NHL or ALL. As a result, Patient Type (1=NHL adults, 2=ALL adults, 3=ALL paediatrics) was identified as a potential covariate for further investigation by the forward and backward selection algorithm and was included in the final model (Table 4).

The model predicted the population and individual concentrations well and the majority of CWRES and IWRES were evenly distributed across the x-axis of both concentration and time, indicating no major deviation or trend over the entire concentrations and observation time in the population.

VPC plots based on the actual sampling time of observed data after first dose for all patients with ALL, and paediatric patients with ALL are shown in Figure 1 top and bottom, respectively.

There were no trends in ETA vs categorical or continuous covariates, as shown for age, bodyweight and baseline body surface area (Figure 2).

InO Cmax, Ctrough, cumulative AUC and β half -life were simulated for adult and paediatric patients with ALL using the post-hoc estimates (accounting for covariate effects) from the final model. Fixed dosing regimen of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle of inotuzumab ozogamicin, administered at fractionated doses of 0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 for the first 21 days and then every 28 days were simulated for 4 continuous cycles. Table 5 shows the median (range) and mean (SD) of simulated inotuzumab ozogamicin exposures and β half -life for the patients with ALL included in the popPK analysis. Figure 3 shows boxplots of the simulated inotuzumab ozogamicin exposures for the patients with ALL included in the popPK analysis. The median exposures of inotuzumab ozogamicin in paediatric patients with ALL seemed to be slightly higher than those in adult patients with ALL. However, boxplots of the range of simulated inotuzumab ozogamicin exposures for the patients with ALL showed the simulated inotuzumab ozogamicin exposures including Ctrough between adult and paediatric patients with ALL generally overlapped (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Simulated PK Parameters in Patients with R/R ALL by Patient Type

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessor's comment:

A pooled PopPK analysis was performed including both adult and paediatric PK data. Including adult data is considered reasonable given the limited paediatric PK data.

According to VPCs, the final model gave acceptable description of the observed data, despite a slight trend of underprediction of the median concentrations over time in paediatric patients. The ETA vs covariate plots indicates that there were no relevant trends seen for the most important covariates related to age and body size. Age was not tested as a continuous covariate but only grouping all paediatric patients in a patient type. This is not a generally preferred approach, however, considering that baseline BSA is a significant covariate, and the lack of trend in the ETA of the different parameters vs age and bodyweight, this is acceptable.

The MAH proposes to update SmPC section 5.2 with the following text based on the popPK modelling:

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 824 patients, patient age group (paediatric [≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years of age] vs adult) is not considered to have a significant effect on inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition over the treatment duration.

The MAH´s conclusion that the exposure is similar in adults is however not fully agreed, as the boxed plots show higher median exposure in all PK parameters for paediatric patients compared to adult ALL patients, indicating that the dose may be slightly too high in paediatric patients. The clinical relevance of this higher exposure is unknown. The relative difference in exposure between adults and children should be described in the SmPC instead of the currently proposed text. The SmPC text should be revised to provide information on the exposure ( SmPC comment ), for example:

At the adult recommended dose, the exposure in paediatric patients with ALL (aged ≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years) was [xx%] higher than in adults. The clinical relevance of the increased exposure is unknown.

An exposure/response model has been provided but is not detailed here as no SmPC claims are based on it and no new indication is sought.

## 7. Clinical Efficacy aspects

## 7.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## 7.1.1. Study design Study ITCC-059

Paediatric participants (≥1 and &lt; 18 years) with relapsed (2 nd  or greater relapse or first relapse after transplant)/refractory CD22-positive BCP-ALL were enrolled in Study ITCC-059.

The objectives of the study were to identify the recommended dose of InO administered IV either as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B) for paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL, and to estimate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the selected recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of monotherapy InO, and to evaluate PK and PD in this patient population.

a. No enrollment of Stratum 1B-ASP occurred; thus analysis is not included in this report.

The study protocol includes two other disease strata, ie, Stratum 2 for other CD22 positive B-cell malignancies and Stratum 3 for VHR first relapse CD22-positive BCP-ALL patients; no data are included in the Summary of Clinical efficacy submitted with the current variation, as these cohorts were not included in the PIP (the VHR cohort was added as an amendment and continues to enrol patients).

## Assessor's comment:

As Besponsa is currently approved as monotherapy only in the EU, the MAH proposes to update the SmPC with data from Stratum 1A (Phase 1 and 2). Therefore, data from stratum 1B (combination therapy) will not be presented in this assessment report.

Efficacy data from both Stratum 1A and Stratum 1B have been previously presented in the assessment report for procedure EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004.

## 7.1.2. Treatments

Stratum 1A :

Dose escalation: 25 participants were treated; 12 received InO 1.4 mg/m 2 /cycle (dose level [DL]1) and 13 received InO 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle (DL2).

Phase 2 Cohort: 28 participants received InO 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle.

A cycle of therapy is defined as 3 doses of InO administered on Days 1, 8 and 15. Cycle 1 lasted 22 days (with possible delays allowed up to 42 days, depending on response and recovery from toxicity); subsequent cycles lasted 28 days, again with possible delays up to 42 days. Following Cycle 1, in patients who had achieved a CR/CRi/CRp, the Day 1 dose of InO was decreased slightly due to no loading dose requirement.

For these single agent InO cohorts, a maximum of 6 cycles of InO was allowed for patients not proceeding to HSCT. For patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of study treatment was 2 cycles, with a maximum of 3 cycles for any patient who was not MRD-negative after 2 cycles.

## 7.1.3. Objective(s), outcomes and endpoints

The primary objective of the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study was to identify a RP2D of InO administered IV either as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B).

The Phase 2 portion of the study further evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the selected InO dose as single agent, and evaluated PK and PD in this patient population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint in Phase 2 was overall response rate, ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with CR/CRi/CRp, measured as best response during InO treatment.

The efficacy objectives and outcomes are further described in Table 7 below.

## 7.1.4. Statistical Methods

Primary Estimand in Stratum 1A: The safety of single agent InO MTD or RP2D measured by DLT rate estimated based on data from DLT-evaluable participants during the first course of therapy in Stratum 1A. The estimand has the following attributes:

- Population: CD22+R/R BCP-ALL pediatric participants, as defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria to reflect the targeted population of the treatment, who received at least one dose of InO and either experience DLT(s) during the first course of therapy or did not experience DLT during the first course of therapy and received at least 2 out of 3 doses of the prescribed dose (67%) of the InO during that course.
- Variable: Occurrence of DLTs. DLTs are defined in Appendix 1.
- Population-level summary measure: DLT rate defined as the number of DLT- evaluable paticipants with DLTs during first course of therapy divided by the number of DLT-evaluable participants.

Primary Estimand in Phase 2: The treatment effect of single agent InO on ORR as assessed by investigator. The estimand has the following attributes:

- Population: CD22+R/R BCP-ALL pediatric participants, as defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria to reflect the targeted population of the treatment, who received at least 1 dose of study intervention and have completed a baseline disease assessment and at least one post-baseline disease assessment.
- Variable: Objective response defined as CR, CRi and CRp based on investigator's assessment during InO treatment.
- Intercurrent event(s): The intercurrent event is start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy and discontinuation from InO treatment. While on treatment strategy will be applied and data collected after the start of the intercurrent event will be excluded.
- Population-level summary measure: ORR defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population with an objective response and 2-sided 90% and 95% CI for ORR.

The binary endpoints (response rates) will be presented as a proportion with exact 2-sided 95% and 90% confidence intervals.

Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Unless otherwise specified, the calculation of proportions will include the missing category. Therefore, counts of missing observations will be included in the denominator and presented as a separate category.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Time-to-event endpoints (DOR) will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method or the competing risks method for cumulative incidence functions if time to disease transformation is included as an endpoint. The cumulative incidence and its standard error will be estimated using Gray's method.

When applying the Kaplan Meier method, median times and quartiles with associated 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the Brookmeyer-Crowley linear transformation method will be provided, assuming no ties among observed survival times. If median times will not be reached at the time of the analysis, survival rates at the specific time point will be provided together with the associated 2-sided 95% CI based on Greenwood's formula.

Methods to Manage Missing Data: The baseline value will be defined as the last non-missing value prior to first dose, unless specifically stated otherwise.

Partial dates are handled in the following way: if the month and year are present but day is missing, date is set to 15th of the month. If month is missing, it is set to June. No other imputation of missing data will be performed.

No formal interim analysis was planned for Stratum 1A, phase 2 or Stratum 1B. As this was an openlabel study, the SAP specified that the sponsor may conduct unblinded review of the data during the course of study for the purpose of dose confirmation and safety assessment.

## 7.2. Results

## 7.2.1. Study subjects

The Full Analysis Set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study therapy and was used for the efficacy analysis and the safety analysis (Stratum 1A: 25 participants, Phase 2 Cohort: 28).

The Response Evaluable Analysis Set (for primary analysis in the Phase 2 Cohort) included all participants who received at least 1 dose of InO and have completed a baseline disease assessment and at least 1 post-baseline disease assessment (28 participants). Therefore, the Response Evaluable Analysis Set is equal to the Full Analysis Set for Phase 2.

The PD Analysis Set included participants who were treated and had at least 1 of the PD parameters available (Stratum 1A: 25 participants, Phase 2 Cohort: 28).

## Stratum 1A:

Of the 25 participants enrolled and treated, 68.0% were male. The median age was 11 years (range: 1 to 16 years) and the median BSA was 1.22 m2 (range: 1-2 m2).

## At baseline:

- Median WBC count was 2.30×109/L (range: 0-17×109/L).
- 14 (56.0%) participants had bone marrow blasts ≥50%.
- Median peripheral blood blasts count was 149.5×106/L (range: 0-2950).
- Median mean fluorescence intensity for CD22-positive ALL cells was 2949 (range: 505- 8370).

In Stratum 1A, 12 (48%) participants had received at least 1 prior allogeneic HSCT; 2 (8.0%) participants had received prior CAR T-cell therapy.

## Phase 2 Cohort:

Of the 28 participants enrolled and treated, 67.9% were male. The median age was 7.5 years (range: 1 to 17 years) and the median BSA was 0.99 m2 (range: 1-2 m2). See Table 8.

## At baseline:

- Median WBC count was 2.78×109/L (range: 1-132×109/L).
- 17 (60.7%) participants had bone marrow blasts ≥50%.
- Median peripheral blood blasts count was 170.0×106/L (range: 0-15,140).
- Median mean fluorescence intensity for CD22-positive ALL cells was 2297 (range: 479- 9619).

In the Phase 2 Cohort, 14 (50.0%) participants had received at least 1 prior allogeneic HSCT; 3 (10.7%) participants had received prior CAR T-cell therapy.

## 7.2.2. Participant flow

A total of 85 participants were assigned to treatment and 83 participants were treated.

## Stratum 1A (Phase 1 dose-finding part of the monotherapy):

- In Stratum 1A, a total of 25 participants were treated: 12 received InO 1.4 mg/m 2 /cycle (DL1) and 13 received InO 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle (DL2).
- As of the data cut-off date, 6 (24.0%) participants completed the treatment phase and the required follow-up (FU). Eighteen (72.0%) participants discontinued due to death. One (4.0%) participant was lost to FU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase 2 Cohort (monotherapy):

- In Phase 2 Cohort, 28 participants were to receive InO 1.8 mg/m 2 /cycle (1 participant with unintended lower dose level at 1.4 mg/m 2 /cycle).
- As of the data cut-off date, one (3.6%) participant completed the 3-year FU. Eight (28.6%) participants remained ongoing in the long-term FU phase of the study. Seventeen (60.7%) participants discontinued due to death. Two (7.1%) participants were lost to FU.

## 7.2.3. Efficacy results

In the Phase 2 Cohort, the primary objective was met demonstrating CR/CRi/CRp rate significantly greater than the 30% null hypothesis rate (30% was chosen based on clinical expert opinion and recent studies in similar populations) with 1-sided p-value &lt;0. 0001. There were 22 participants who achieved an objective response (CR/CRi/CRp) among the 28 participants in the Response Evaluable Analysis Set (CR: 18, CRp: 1, CRi: 3). The estimated ORR (CR+CRi+CRp) was 78.6% (95% CI: 59.091.7). See Table 9.

Since the Full Analysis Set is equal to the Response Evaluable Analysis Set, the same results were obtained in both sets.

## 7.2.4. Hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and CAR T-cell Therapy Rate

## Stratum 1A:

Eight (32.0%) participants had post InO allogeneic HSCT transplants. All were in CR at the time of HSCT. A total of 4 (16.0%) participants in Stratum 1A underwent at least 1 CAR T-cell therapy given after end of study therapy or after last dose of InO.

## Phase 2 Cohort:

Eighteen (64.3%) participants had post InO allogeneic HSCT transplants. Seventeen of 18 participants were in CR/CRi/CRp at the time of HSCT. A total of 9 (32.1%) participants in Phase 2 Cohort underwent at least 1 CAR T-cell therapy given after end of study therapy or after last dose of InO.

## 7.3. Discussion of Clinical Efficacy aspects

Study ITCC-059 is an ongoing Phase I/II study. It is the first of two clinical studies included in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO). The primary evaluation of the study has been finalised and includes the following:

- -The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study was to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for InO as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (modified UKALL-R3-based re-induction regimen; Stratum 1B) in paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL.
- -The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study was to determine efficacy (ORR) for InO monotherapy at the RP2D in paediatric patients with R/R CD22-positive ALL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of the primary efficacy evaluation were already submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/004119/P46/004, however, no SmPC claims were then made. With the current variation, the MAH has suggested updates of the SmPC based on the data from the monotherapy stratum of the study, as Besponsa is currently approved in adults for monotherapy use only. Therefore, only the monotherapy data (Stratum 1A) are discussed in the current assessment report.

In the Phase 1 portion of Study ITCC-059, the RP2D of InO as monotherapy in paediatric patients was 1.8 mg/m 2  during Cycle 1, based on a slightly higher ORR than at the lower dose level, and an acceptable safety profile (see below).

This is the same dose as recommended for adult patients in the approved SmPC: 'For the first cycle, the recommended total dose of BESPONSA for all patients is 1.8 mg/m 2  per cycle, given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m 2 ), 8 (0.5 mg/m 2 ), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2).'

InO exposure in paediatric patients is presented under Clinical Pharmacology aspects above.

In the Phase 1 portion of the study, including 20 subjects, the ORR after InO monotherapy (both dose levels combined) was 80% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7). The ORR was slightly higher for the 1.8 mg/m 2  dose (84.6%, 95% CI: 54.6-98.1) than for the 1.4 mg/m 2  dose level (75.0%, 95% CI: 42.8-94.5).

In the Phase 2 portion of the study, including 28 subjects, the ORR after InO monotherapy (1.8 mg/m 2 in the first cycle) was 78.6% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7).

DoR was 8.0 months (95% CI: 3.9-13.9) and 7.6 months (95% CI: 3.3-NE) in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively.

The MAH suggests describing the ORR and DoR results in section 5.1 of the SmPC, which is accepted.

Given the limited paediatric efficacy data yet available, the proposed standard text in section 4.2, i.e.: ' Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made ' is considered adequate.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The basis for the proposed paediatric safety updates in the SmPC is the data from the monotherapy stratum (Stratum 1A) of Study ITCC-059. The study design is described under Clinical Efficacy above.

AEs described in the following sections were all TEAEs if not specifically identified. The AE causality was assessed by the investigator and/or the sponsor.

## 8.2. Results

Subject demographics, baseline characteristics and disposition are described under Clinical Efficacy above.

## 8.2.1. Exposure

A maximum of 6 cycles of InO could be given in this study for all patients, with a higher dose given on Day 1 of Cycle 1. For patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of InO was 2 cycles, up to a maximum of 3 cycles for patients who were not yet MRD negative after 2 cycles of InO. For the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stratum 1A and Phase 2 cohorts, a cycle of therapy was defined as 3 doses of InO administered weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15. All cycles lasted 28 days (except Cycle 1 may be as short as 22 days), with delays allowed up to 42 days to allow recovery from toxicity.

Stratum 1A:

25 participants were dosed; 14 (56.0%) participants started &gt; 1 cycle. The median number of cycles initiated was 2 (range: 1-4) cycles. The median total dose of InO received was 2.59 mg/m2 (range: 0.57-5.28 mg/m2), with a median dose intensity of 1.37 mg/m2/cycle (range: 0.57-1.83 mg/m2/cycle). The median relative dose intensity was 100.0% (range: 44.56%-105.13%).

## Phase 2 Cohort:

28 participants were dosed; 16 (57.1%) participants started &gt; 1 cycle. The median number of cycles initiated was 2 (range: 1-4) cycles. The median total dose of InO received was 3.22 mg/m2 (range: 0.76-6.47 mg/m2), with a median dose intensity of 1.66 mg/m2/cycle (range: 0.76-1.86 mg/m2/cycle). The median relative dose intensity was 100.04% (range: 70.83%- 105.22%).

## 8.2.2. Dose-limiting toxicity

DLT was evaluated in Cycle 1 only. The results are summarised in Table 11. In stratum 1A, the RP2D for InO was determined to be 1.8 mg/m 2  during Cycle 1.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined as any event increasing in severity from baseline or within 28 days of the last dose of study treatment.

a. Includes treatment-emergent adverse events leading to delay, reduction and adverse events leading to permanently discontinuation of study treatment.

## 8.2.4. Deaths

A summary of deaths during the study is provided in Table 149.

There were two deaths due to toxicity in Phase 2:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -one encephalopathy leading to cardiac arrest on Study Day 78, considered not related to InO but attributed to cumulative neuro-toxicity (pre-study prolonged intrathecal chemotherapy)
- -one bilateral pneumonitis on Study Day 120, 70 days post-transplant, considered at least possible related to InO as the event started after follow-up ALL treatment.

For 17 patients, the cause of death was described as Other, which included e.g. sepsis and transplantrelated events.

## 8.2.5. Serious adverse events (SAEs)

Stratum 1A - Phase 1

In Stratum 1A, 16 (64.0%) participants had TE-SAEs. Nine (36.0%) participants had treatment-related TE-SAEs.

The TE-SAE SOC with the highest proportion of participants was Infections and Infestations (n = 7 [28.0%]).

The most frequently reported TESAEs (by PT, ≥10%) were febrile neutropenia (n = 4 [16.0%]) and pyrexia (n = 3 [12.0%]).

Phase 2 cohort

In the Phase 2 Cohort, 17 (60.7%) participants had TESAEs. Nine (32.1%) participants had treatmentrelated TE-SAEs.

The TE-SAE SOCs with the highest proportion of participants were Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (n = 5 [17.9%]) and Infections and Infestations (n = 4 [14.3%]).

The most frequently reported TESAEs (by PT, ≥10%) were veno -occlusive disease (VOD; n = 6 [21.4%]) and febrile neutropenia (n = 5 [17.9%]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 8.2.6. Dose Modification and/or Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events

## Stratum 1A

One (8.3%) participant in DL1 had InO interruption due to headache (not treatment-related). Eight (32.0%) participants permanently discontinued InO due to TEAEs, of which 7 (28.0%) participants permanently discontinued InO due to treatment-related TEAEs. The all-causality TEAEs associated with permanent discontinuation in ≥2 participants included increased ALT and decreased platelet count

## Phase 2 Cohort

Five (17.9%) participants had study drug interruption/reduction/delay due to AEs of increased ALT (4), increased AST (2) and febrile neutropenia (1), all of which were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related.

Four (14.3%) participants permanently discontinued InO due to TEAEs of increased ALT/AST, VOD, disease progression and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The increased ALT/AST and VOD reported in 2 participants were treatment-related.

## 8.2.7. Adverse events of special interest - veno-occlusive disease (VOD)

All cases of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( SOS) are summarized as 'VOD' in this report.

All VOD events reported in Study ITCC-059 were considered probably/possibly related to InO or with multiple causalities.

## Stratum 1A:

VOD was reported in 2 (8.0%) participants; neither participant reported an allo HSCT before or after InO.

- In DL1, 1 participant developed Grade 3 VOD (59 days after the last dose of InO), which was ongoing at the time of death.
- In DL2, 1 participant developed Grade 4 VOD (44 days after the last dose of InO), which was ongoing at the time of death.

## Phase 2 Cohort:

VOD was reported in 6 (21.4%) participants, 5 of which occurred after follow-up allo HSCT. The postHSCT VOD rate was 5/18 (27.8% [95% CI: 47.8176-100.0]).

- 2 participants reported Grade 4 VOD:
- o Onset 17 days after HSCT; 1 ongoing at death;
- o Onset 4 days after HSCT; resolved.
- 3 participants reported Grade 3 VOD:
- o Onset 3 days after HSCT; ongoing at death;
- o 1 event was not associated with HSCT; onset of VOD occurred 7 days after the 1st dose of InO; resolved;
- o 1 event started 17 days after HSCT; resolved.
- 1 participant had Grade 2 VOD with onset 10 days after HSCT; resolved.

Among the treated participants, VOD was reported in 4 of 30 (13.3%) participants aged 2-&lt; 12 years and 4 of 21 (19.0%) participants aged 12-&lt; 18 years. Among the participants who proceeded to post study HSCT, VOD was reported in 3 of 14 (21.4%) participants aged 2-&lt; 12 years and 2 of 11 (18.2%) participants aged 12-&lt; 18 years. VOD was not reported by participants aged 1-&lt; 2 years during InO treatment or after post-study HSCT.

Among the treated participants, VOD was reported in 3 of 27 (11.1%) participants with normal hepatic function and 5 of 26 (19.2%) participants with mild hepatic dysfunction. Among the participants who proceeded to post study HSCT, VOD was reported in 1 of 13 (7.7%) participants with normal hepatic function and 4 of 13 (30.8%) participants with mild hepatic dysfunction.

In the Phase 2 Cohort, all (100.0%) participants had AESIs.

- 20 (71.4%) participants had Myelosuppression/Cytopenia. The most frequently reported TEAESIs (by PT) were decreased platelet count, anaemia (n = 12 [42.9%] each) and decreased neutrophil count and decreased WBC count (n = 10 [35.7%] each).

## 8.2.9. Clinical chemistry

One participant in the Phase 2 part of the study met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy's Law: concurrent ALT/AST ≥3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN and ALP ≤ 2 × ULN or missing . None of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these abnormalities were reported as AEs. This subject experienced a Grade 3 VOD on the same day of these laboratory abnormalities (shortly after the only dose of InO). The VOD resolved in a few days, and the laboratory abnormalities returned to normal. The concurrent abnormal LFTs may have been attributed to the VOD. Thus, this case was not a confirmed Hy's Law case.

## 8.2.10. Immunogenicity

In InO single agent treated participants, 1 (2.0%) participant in Stratum 1A was positive for ADA at pre-dose. No participant had treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA.

## 8.2.11. Intrinsic factors

TEAEs were analysed by intrinsic factors including age, gender, baseline hepatic function, baseline renal function, and baseline CD22 expression in leukemic blasts; and extrinsic factors including prior HSCT and other baseline diagnosis (prior line of ALL therapy). Due to the small sample size, Study ITCC-059 was not powered for formal analyses of factor effects. Based on the available data, the overall AEs do not appear to be substantially affected by these intrinsic or extrinsic factors.

## 8.3. Discussion of Clinical Safety aspects

The safety database from Study ITCC-059 consists of 25 (Phase I) + 28 (Phase II), i.e. 53 paediatric patients treated with InO monotherapy (Stratum 1A).

The subjects in Stratum 1A were acceptably evenly distributed over the paediatric age range, with 12 subjects &lt; 6 years, 20 subjects 6 to &lt; 12 years and 21 subjects 12 to &lt;18 years old.

The median number of cycles administered was two (2) for InO monotherapy.

The MAH suggests that the safety profile for InO in paediatric patients was acceptable and generally manageable. In monotherapy, the most frequently reported TEAEs were pyrexia, vomiting, anaemia and decreased platelet count.

Thus, as previously reported in adults, TEAEs were most commonly reported within SOCs Blood and lymphatic disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. Haemorrhage, likely secondary to thrombocytopenia, and infections appeared to be less severe and slightly less commonly reported in the paediatric patients compared with what was observed in the pivotal registration study in adults.

## Deaths

A total of 47 patients (56.6%) died during the study, the majority (n=28) due to disease progression. For 17 patients, the cause of death was described as Other, which included e.g. sepsis and transplantrelated events. For the remaining two patients, the cause of death was described as Toxicity, however, the MAH suggests the toxicity was not due to InO in either case: One case of cardiac arrest was suggested due to cumulative neurotoxicity and one case of bilateral pneumonitis started after followup ALL therapy. The latter case was considered at least possibly related to InO by the Investigator. The pattern of deaths in the study do not give raise to immediate concern.

## Veno-occlusive disease (VOD)

An increased risk for VOD/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), above the risk of standard chemotherapy, has been observed in adult patients treated with InO. This risk is most marked in patients who undergo subsequent HSCT, and in particular patients who receive a conditioning regimen

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

containing two alkylating agents. The risk is also increased in patients ≥65 years of age and patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN prior to HSCT. In the pivotal registration study in adults, VOD/SOS was reported in 14% of the patients. In 3% of the patients, the event was not associated with HSCT.

In study ITCC-059, VODs were reported in 8/53 patients (15.1%) after InO monotherapy. Thus, despite lack of some risk factors such as higher age, the VOD rate in this study was in the same range as that reported in adults. The rate reported in paediatric subjects without subsequent HSCT was about twice as high (3/53; 5.7%) as that reported in adults without subsequent HSCT (3%). However, the small number of events precludes definite conclusions on the rate. About half of the paediatric subjects had mild hepatic dysfunction. As in adults, VOD was more commonly reported in paediatric subjects with hepatic dysfunction (5 events) than in subjects with normal hepatic function (3 events). This was even more evident in patients undergoing subsequent HSCT (1 event in a subject with normal hepatic function and 4 events in subjects with hepatic impairment). Risk factors for VOD are well described in the SmPC.

## Dose-limiting toxicity, dose modifications and treatment discontinuations

Dose-limiting toxicity as evaluated in Cycle 1 of the dose-finding portions of the study included ALT increased, decreased platelet count, decreased neutrophil count, and veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD; the latter in combination with chemotherapy).

The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs leading to study drug interruption or dose reduction were increased ALT and increased AST. Other events included blood bilirubin increased, neutrophil count decreased, Escherichia infection, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, urticaria and febrile neutropenia.

A total of 11 patients permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs that were considered treatment related. The AEs leading to permanent discontinuation in ≥2 patients were increased ALT (n=4), increased AST (n=2), platelet count decreased (n=2) and VOD (n=2).

The pattern of dose modifications and treatment discontinuations in the paediatric patients, thus, mirrors the known safety profile from adults.

## Conclusion

Overall, it is agreed that the review of the data from Study ITCC-059 did not identify any new ADRs in paediatric patients, as the evaluated events are consistent with the ones already identified in the adult patients. As in adults, VOD was commonly reported in paediatric subjects (in about 15% of subjects after InO monotherapy), and the risk is increased in subjects undergoing HSCT and/or who have some degree of hepatic impairment.

## SmPC update

According to the EMA document 'EMA/551202/2010 Frequently asked Questions on SmPC paediatric information', safety data should be described in section 5.1 in case it has been collected in a paediatric development for an indication neither approved in children nor in adults. However, as the paediatric indication investigated in Study ITCC-059 is the same as that approved in adults, it considered more appropriate to describe the paediatric safety data in section 4.8. Accordingly, the MAH has updated Section 4.8 of the SmPC with paediatric immunogenicity and safety data, which is agreed.

## Summary of results (presented in Annex 7):

Study ITCC-059 was a Phase 1/2 multicenter, international, single-arm, multi-cohort, open-label study conducted in 53 paediatric participants ≥ 1 and &lt;18 years of age with relapsed or refractory CD22 -positive B-cell precursor ALL to identify a recommended Phase 2 Dose (Phase 1) of inotuzumab ozogamicin administered intravenously (IV) either as monotherapy (Stratum 1A) or in combination with chemotherapy (Stratum 1B) and to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the selected inotuzumab ozogamicin dose as a monotherapy agent (Phase 2). The study also evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inotuzumab ozogamicin as monotherapy.

## Data from MAH's Safety Database :

Cumulatively through 15 February 2023, 88 cases (2.3% of the total dataset) including 90 SAEs originating from the study ITCC-059 were identified. These cases involved 56 unique paediatric participants, since multiple cases were reported for the same participants.

There were 18 female and 38 male participants; age ranged from 17 months to 18 years.

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 3) AEs were: Febrile neutropenia (16), Venoocclusive liver disease (10), Sepsis (8), Pyrexia (6), Neoplasm progression (4), and Venoocclusive disease (3). The clinical outcome of the reported 90 SAEs were resolved (69), resolved with sequelae (2), not resolved (7), and fatal (12).

Out of these 88 cases, in 44 cases, the reported 44 SAEs were assessed related to the administration of inotuzumab ozogamicin by the investigator and/or the Company.

These 44 SAEs were: Febrile neutropenia (13), Venoocclusive liver disease (10), Venoocclusive disease (3), Neutrophil count decreased (2), Acute kidney injury, Atrial fibrillation, Blood bilirubin increased, Haemorrhage intracranial, Malaise, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Pain, Platelet count decreased, Pneumonia, Pneumonia fungal, Pyrexia, Renal failure, Sepsis, Sinusitis, Sinus tachycardia, and Varicella zoster virus infection (1 each).

PRAC Rapporteur comment: Venooclusive liver disease / sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in the context of the current treatment remains an issue of concern warranting further follow-up.

## b. Clinical trial exposure data for Study B1931030

This Phase 4 study is a PMR that was requested by the US FDA and is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 inotuzumab ozogamicin dose levels in adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL who are eligible for HSCT and who are at higher risk for developing VOD post-HSCT.

Primary Objective: To evaluate the rates of VOD and hematologic remission (CR/CRi) for 2 inotuzumab ozogamicin dose levels in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL who are eligible for HSCT and who are at higher risk for developing VOD post-HSCT.

Secondary Objective: Safety and efficacy of 2 inotuzumab ozogamicin dose levels.

Regarding the proposed text in section 5.2

## Paediatric population

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 824 patients, patient age group (paediatric [ ≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years of age] vs adult) is not considered to have a clinically meaningful effect on inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition over the treatment duration.

## Rapp Comment:

This should be revised to reflect the increased exposure in paediatric patients, for example:

At the adult recommended dose, the exposure in paediatric patients with ALL (aged ≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years) was [xx%] higher than in adults. The clinical relevance of the increased exposure is unknown.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Although Patient Type was identified as a statistically significant covariate on decay coefficient associated with time-dependent clearance (kdes), it is not considered to have a clinically meaningful effect on InO disposition.

The current population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis (Module 5.3.3.5, PMAR-EQDD-B193e-DP4-1490) for characterization of inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) PK in paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed best fit with a final model that incorporated the effect of Patient Type (paediatric patients with ALL, adult patients with ALL, and adult patients with nonHodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]) on decay coefficient associated with time-dependent clearance (kdes). The inter-individual variability (IIV) for kdes in the final model remained similar to that of the base model (55.5% versus 55.7%), indicating that the Patient Type did not substantially contribute to the IIV of kdes even though it was a statistically significant covariate of the parameter.

In the final model, the kdes was estimated to be 79.5% (95% CI: 72.9%-84.7%) lower in paediatric patients with ALL and 87.7% (95% CI: 84.7%-90.2%) lower in adult patients with ALL than that in adult patients with NHL, respectively. However, it is important to mention that time-dependent clearance (CLt [i.e., CL2·e[-kdes·Time]]) is one of the components of the total InO CL estimate (i.e., total CL=CL1+CLt) and its contribution changes over time. Thus, the actual impact of any covariate on kdes does not translate into a similar magnitude of change in elimination rate. The estimated 79.5% (ALL paediatrics) and 87.7% (ALL adults) decrease in kdes with BLSTPB =4% leads to variations in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

time that CLt is reduced to 50%, which ranges from 89 (ALL paediatrics) to 147 hours (ALL adults), respectively. For paediatric and adult patients with ALL, the contribution of CLt to total CL becomes negligible after 5 half-lives, or by 2.6 and 4.4 weeks, respectively. Given the estimated change from the typical value of kdes for both paediatric and adult patients, and considering that CL2 is not the only CL component, the Patient Type (paediatric patients with ALL versus adult patients with ALL) is not considered to have a clinically meaningful effect on InO disposition over the treatment duration.

While median exposures in all PK parameters appear to be higher for in paediatric patients compared to adult ALL patients, the simulated InO serum exposures generally overlapped between adult and paediatric patients with ALL (Module 2.7.2, Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies, Figure 1).

The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) identified in pediatric studies (ITCC-059 and INO-Ped-ALL-1) is the same as the approved dosing regimen in adults (1.8 mg/m2/cycle).

In summary, the MAH considers the following text 'Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 824 patients, patient age group (paediatric [≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years of age] vs adult) is not considered to have a clinically meaningful effect on inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition over the treatment duration.' adequately describes the InO PK for paediatric patients with ALL.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant has accepted the comments in all section except section 5.2. Further, information on number of subjects who received subsequent HSCT was only added to section 4.8 (as a risk factor for VTE) but not to section 5.1, as requested. As this information is considered relevant for the interpretation of Duration of Response data, it should be included also in section 5.1.

## Regarding the text in 5.2:

As noted previously, age was not tested as a continuous covariate but only grouping all paediatric patients referred to as a 'patient type' (adults vs non-adults). This is not a generally preferred approach, however, considering that baseline BSA is a significant covariate, and the lack of trend in the ETA plots for age and bodyweight, this is acceptable.

While it is agreed that the simulated InO exposures are overlapping, the medians for all parameters (Ctrough, Cmax, cumulative AUC) are still higher in paediatric patients than adults, which should be reflected in the SmPC. This could be an effect of BSA in the model.

Finally, the essence of pharmacokinetics is that the same dose (even when adjusted by BSA) does not necessarily result in the same systemic exposure. The comment is thus reiterated, the text in section 5.2 should read:

At the adult recommended dose, the exposure in paediatric patients with ALL (aged ≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years) was [xx%] higher than in adults. The clinical relevance of the increased exposure is unknown.

Conclusion: Issue not resolved. See outstanding comments in the Annotated SmPC.

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

- [ ] No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## Additional issue.

With the response, an amended CSR for Study ITCC-059 has been submitted.

## MAH's comment:

Pfizer recently found an error identified in W1203581 (Study ITCC-059) Clinical Study report (CSR) submitted to EMA as part of this Type II variation.

In the Phase 2 Cohort, the 1-sided p-value of overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete remission (CR) / complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) / complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), as primary efficacy endpoint, was mistakenly calculated using the 50% null hypothesis rate, instead of 30% null hypothesis rate as defined in the study protocol and the statistical analysis plan. In CSR v3.0 (03-Apr-2023), most changes were due to the new data transfer in February 2023 resulting in table and figure updates. In addition, a few programming errors were identified after CSR v2.0 approved on 21-Feb-2023 and were corrected in this amendment as well. Full summary of changes is enclosed within this submission.

Pfizer considers that there is no impact on the conclusion for this study or the positive benefit/risk profile of Besponsa in pediatric patients with R/R ALL.

Amended CSR for Study ITCC-059 along with the document providing the summary of changes is enclosed along with the response to the RSI.

## Assessor's comment:

The updated analysis led to the following amendment in the CSR:

'In the Phase 2 Cohort (Table 8), the primary objective was met demonstrating CR/CRi/CRp rate significantly greater than the 30% null hypothesis rate with 1-sided p-value &lt;0.0001 of 0.0019.'

It is agreed that this does not change the overall conclusion of the study. Section 7.2.3 of this AR has been updated accordingly.

Furthermore, the company has provided their view on the comments on the Product Information as circulated during second phase of the procedure by the Rapporteur:

- SmPC comment Section 5.1:

Information on subsequent HSCT was added in section 4.8. However, as this information is relevant also for the data on duration of response, the information should be given also here.

## MAH response:

Accepted. The Applicant has updated Section 5.1 to include the information on number of subjects that proceeded to subsequent HSCT, in alignment with Section 4.8.

## Assessment:

Issue resolved.

## SmPC comment Section 5.2 :

The MAH´s argumentation is not agreed. The text should reflect the increased mean exposure in paediatric patients, for example: \"At the adult recommended dose, the exposure in paediatric patients with ALL (aged ≥ 1 and &lt; 18 years) was [xx%] higher than in adults. The clinical relevance of the increased exposure is unknown.\"
