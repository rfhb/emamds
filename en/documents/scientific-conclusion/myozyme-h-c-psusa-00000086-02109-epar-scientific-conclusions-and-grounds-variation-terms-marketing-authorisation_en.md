## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alglucosidase alfa, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on infusion associated reactions from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the  PRAC considers a  causal relationship between  algucosidase  alfa and the following  adverse  drug reactions:  dyspepsia,  dysphagia,  transient  skin  discoloration,  blister,  palmar  erythema,  infusion  site erythema, infusion site urticaria, and hypoxia, is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing alglucosidase alfa should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for alglucosidase alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alglucosidase alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
