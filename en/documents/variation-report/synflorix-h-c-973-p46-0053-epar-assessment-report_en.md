-  Description
-  Methods
- Objectives

## Primary :

- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in terms of occurrence of adverse events with grade 3 intensity after booster vaccination.

## Secondary:

- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine after administration of any vaccine dose.
- To assess one month post-booster dose, the immunogenicity of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine.
- To assess the immunogenicity of a 2-dose catch-up vaccination with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the second year of life.
- To  assess  the  antibody  persistence  11  to  18  months  after  completion  of  the  primary vaccination course with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-032.
- To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals'  DTPa  vaccine when co-administered with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine at 15-21 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study design

The study was an open study with two parallel groups which included subjects from a single centre. The vaccination schedules were as follows:

- Pn-Pn group: Booster vaccination at 15-21 months of age.
- Zil-Pn group: Two-dose catch-up vaccination at 15-21 months and 17-23 months of age, with an interval of 56-118 days.

A booster dose of DTPa vaccine was co-administered with a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine or the first dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT catch-up vaccination (at 15-21 months of age).

Blood sampling: two blood samples were collected in each group.

- Pn-Pn group: prior to and one month post-booster vaccination
- Zil-Pn group: pre-vaccination and one month post-dose 2

## Type of study:

- Pn-Pn group: booster vaccination study following primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT032.
- Zil-Pn group: catch-up vaccination study in children during their second year of life.

Data collection: hard copy Case Report Form (CRF).

- Study population /Sample size

Healthy male or female subjects, between and including 15-21 months of age at the time of Visit 1. Subjects in the Pn-Pn group should have completed the full vaccination course with 10Pn-PD-DiT in the study 10PN-PD-DIT-032. Subjects in the Zil-Pn group were those who were previously enrolled in the

Written informed consent, signed or thumb printed was to be obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of control group of the study 10PN-PD-DIT-032. the subject.

Where parent(s)/LAR(s) were illiterate, the consent form was to be countersigned by a witness.

The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  Nigerian  subjects  who  received  three  doses  of pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-032  (110521),  i.e.  77  planned  subjects. Assuming  that  around  20%  of  these  subjects  might  not  enter  this  study,  one  could  consider  that approximately 60 subjects would receive the booster dose of study vaccine.

- Treatments

Both  groups  received  the  same  vaccines  in  this  study.  The  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  was  administered intramuscularly into the anterolateral region of the thigh. The DTPa vaccine was injected intramuscularly into the left thigh.

- Outcomes/endpoints

## Safety and reactogenicity:

- o Solicited local and general adverse events (AEs)
- o Occurrence of each solicited local adverse event (any, grade 3) within 4 days (Day 0Day 3) after each vaccine dose.
- o Occurrence  of  each  solicited  general  adverse  event  (any,  grade  3,  related)  within  4 days (Day 0-Day 3) after each vaccine dose.
- o Unsolicited adverse events
- o Occurrence  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  within  31  days  (Day  0-Day  30)  after  each vaccine dose.
- o Serious adverse events (SAEs)
- o Occurrence of serious adverse events during the entire study period.

## Immunogenicity:

## Pn-Pn group

Evaluation of the immune responses to the components of the investigational vaccine prior to and one month after the booster immunization:

- o Concentrations of antibodies against vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F.
- o Opsonophagocytic activity against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F*.
- o Concentrations of antibodies against cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A.
- o Opsonophagocytic activity against cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A*
- o Concentrations of antibodies against protein D.

## · Immunogenicity results

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on ATP cohort for analysis of antibody persistence or on the ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  Since,  in  any  group,  the  percentage  of vaccinated  subjects  with  serological  data  excluded  from  the  ATP  cohort  for  persistence  and  for immunogenicity was less than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort was not performed.

The immune responses measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA results one month after completion of the primary vaccination course, prior to and one month after the booster dose (Pn-Pn group) or prior to dose I and one month after dose II (Zil-Pn group) are detailed in Tables 57 and 58.

Assessor's comment: The responses in the 2-dose catch-up group were in some cases lower than the post-dose 3 responses in the primed group (e.g. ELISA results for serotypes 5 and 6B). The study was not  designed  or  powered  for  formal  comparisons  between  the  groups,  and  larger  studies  with  that objective were assessed during the approval procedure for Synflorix. The responses to a single booster dose were generally higher compared to the 2-dose catch-up groups, not unexpectedly. Considering the high response rate in terms of percentage of subjects achieving ≥0.2 µg/mL, and the similarity of these rates to those reported in previous studies, the immunogenicity results of this study do not raise further concern that would result in SPC changes.

- Safety results (summary)

## Solicited local adverse events:

- o In the Pn-Pn group, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event during the  4-day  post-booster  vaccination  period  reported  in  36.8%  of  subjects  who  received  the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine.  Swelling at the 10Pn-PD-DiT administration site was the only grade 3 solicited local adverse event reported (2.9% of subjects).
- o A large swelling reaction was reported for one subject in the Pn-Pn group at the 10-Pn-PD-DiT injection  site on  Day  1  following  booster  vaccination.  The  swelling  was  at  maximum 60 mm diameter, not involving an adjacent joint, and resolved without sequelae within 2 days after onset.
- o In the Zil-Pn group, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event during the 4-day post-vaccination period (30.6% following dose 1 and 13.9% following dose 2 at the 10Pn-PD-DiT administration site). Grade 3 swelling and redness were reported for one subject after dose 1 of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine.

## Solicited general adverse events:

- o In  the  Pn-Pn  group,  fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event during the 4-day post-booster vaccination period (11.8% of subjects). There were no reports of grade 3 solicited general adverse events.
- o In  the  Zil-Pn  group,  fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event during the 4-day post-vaccination period (4.2% of doses; 8.3% of subjects). For one subject, grade 3 fever (axillary temperature &gt; 39.5 °C) was reported following the first dose of 10PnPD-DiT co-administered with DTPa and this was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

## Unsolicited adverse events:

- o In  the  Pn-Pn  group,  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  within  the  31-day  postvaccination  period,  classified  by  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred Term  was  reported  for  45.6%  of  subjects.  A  grade  3  unsolicited  adverse  event (drowning) that also was a serious adverse event, was reported for one subject. None of the reported adverse events were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.
- o In the Zil-Pn group, for 31.9% of doses (50.0% of subjects), at least one unsolicited adverse event within the 31-day post-vaccination period, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term was reported. None of them were grade 3 or were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serious adverse events:

- o In the Pn-Pn group, one fatal event (drowning) was reported for one out of 68 subjects during the entire study period. This event was considered by the investigator as not causally related to vaccination. No non-fatal SAEs were reported in this group.
- o No SAE was reported for subjects in the Zil-Pn group.

Withdrawals due to serious adverse events:

- o One subject in the Pn-Pn group died due to drowning during the study period.

Assessor's comment: The frequency of adverse events, solicited and unsolicited, do not cause further safety concern compared to previously reported safety results.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The current study, which was a booster and catch-up study in Nigerian children 15-21 months of age, does  not  cause  further  concern  regarding  immunogenicity  or  safety  results.  Thus,  the  procedure  is considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is required.
