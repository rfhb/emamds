|         | (including human error-related medication errors) from an important potential risk to an important identified risk following a Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) request (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001753/201710) and in accordance with the Good practice guide on risk minimisation and prevention of medication errors, issued by the PRAC in 2015. Furthermore, in accordance with the updated GVP Module V guidance on RMPs, the Work sharing Applicant (WSA) proposed to remove this risk as it is fully characterised and managed through routine pharmacovigilance and no additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures are planned or being currently undertaken. Information regarding the avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors is included in the PIL for the concerned products. In consequence, section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated in order to add a warning on accidental mix-ups/medication. Additionally, the WSA took the opportunity include minor updates to Annex IIIA to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version.

Further to a CHMP request based on the recommendations from PhVWP, the Product Information (Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated by adding a warning on an increased incidence of heart failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors. In addition to the above the MAH took the opportunity to update annex IIB \"Other conditions\" with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance system. This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of | 17/02/2011 | 17/03/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. After the review of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin containing products should include warning on increased cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. Annex IIB \"Other conditions\" was also updated with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance system. |

The introduction to section 4.8 of the SPCs has also been updated to state that hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect, but no exact frequency is included, as the frequency of hypoglycaemia is highly variable among various patient populations and dose regimens. This update of section 4.8 also includes the removal of hyperglycaemia. All information on hyperglycaemia (including symptoms) has been located in section 4.4, including the warning of the risk of fatal outcome of untreated hyperglycaemic events. The terms `diabetic retinopathy' and `painful neuropathy' have been added to section 4.8. The adverse event \"Fainting/loss of consciousness\" is also added to the list in section 4.8.
