## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 7 July 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of indication for Giotrif to include patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated in accordance.

Furthermore, minor editorial changes have been introduced throughout the PI.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## MAH request for additional market protection

The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. However, during the assessment by the CHMP of the significant benefit towards granting the additional year of marketing protection, the MAH withdrew its request.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013).

The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma accounting for approximately 15% to 25% of all NSCLC (~230,000 to 380,000 cases) 12 .

Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 2013).

Non-small cell lung cancer is associated with high mortality rates as &gt;70% of the patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Molina et al 2008) [stages III and IV according to the American joint committee on cancer staging (AJCC)].

Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for lung cancer, with up to 80% of lung cancer patients reporting a history of tobacco use. Approximately 10% to 30% of non-SQ NSCLC occurs in patients with a never smoker history and a strong correlation with the presence of an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or gene translocation. Squamous NSCLC almost universally occur in patients with a history of tobacco use and only rarely are tumours found, which contain an EGFR activating mutation 3 .  Similarly, mutated ALK and ROS-1 appear rare and mutated KRAS has been reported in about 5% of squamous NSCLC, i.e. in a lower frequency than in adenocarcinoma (about 30%). Alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway appear common, up to close to 50%. TP53 is also frequently mutated 4567 .

In addition to the high mortality associated with NSCLC, a high proportion of patients experience severe morbidity as a result of local and metastatic spread of disease. Common morbidities include generalized weakness and fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea. Local spread of tumour can result in obstructive pneumonia, lobar collapse, haemoptysis, pain from chest wall and rib invasion, and pleural effusions, while distant spread to bone, brain, liver, and adrenals can lead to pain, neurologic sequelae, and laboratory abnormalities. Generalized effects of metastatic disease also include cachexia, thrombotic and embolic events, paraneoplastic conditions, and infections.

Historically, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC have been treated with standard chemotherapy and/or radiation, and while these treatments may provide modest survival benefits, they are rarely curative.

## Refractory SQ NSCLC

Despite new treatments for NSCLC in the last 15 years, most of the available agents do not benefit patients with SQ NSCLC. Limited progress has been made in the treatment choices for these patients, especially in the second-line setting once their disease progresses after first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Recently, nivolumab, an anti-PD1 anti-body, has been approved for the treatment of patient with NSCLC with SQ cell histology, on the basis of a randomized trial conducted in 272 patients where nivolumab appeared to improve median OS of about 3.2 months when compared with docetaxel, given as second line treatment after first line platinum-combination chemotherapy.

## About the product

Giotrif (afatinib) is an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TKI). It covalently binds to and blocks signalling from all homo- and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members EGFR (ErbB1), HER 2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4. Aberrant ErbB signalling triggered by receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype.

Giotrif was first approved in the EU on 25 September 2013 for the following indication:

Giotrif as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of EGFR TKI-naïve adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s).

The recommended dose is 40 mg once daily. Treatment should be continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the patient.

The MAH applied to extend the indication as follows: treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

The proposed recommended dose is the same as the one already approved.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted studies investigating the activity of afatinib in EGFR wild-type NSLC disease models. In addition, supplemental data on binding to secondary receptors are reported.

## 2.2.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The in vivo anti-tumour activity of afatinib as monotherapy was tested in 27 patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer xenografts expressing wild type EGFR (9/27 of squamous origin) passaged subcutaneously in female NMRI nude mice. Afatinib and its vehicle were administered orally (p.o.) once a day for 18 to 42 days (apart from dosing holidays), depending on tumour growth rates and efficacy. The dose volume for all treatments was 10 ml/kg, the dose of afatinib generally 12.5 mg/kg.

The range of sensitivity towards afatinib was wide and ranged from insensitive to very sensitive. Tumour regressions (TGI &gt; 100%) were observed in 3/18 adenocarcinoma and 4/9 squamous carcinoma models (Figure 1).

Overview over all tested tumour xenografts ordered according to increasing (A) TGI values (i.e. increasing sensitivity) or (B) increasing minimum T/C values (i.e. decreasing sensitivity). The statistical analysis was done on the last day of each experiment. Asterisks indicate statistical significance of BIBW 2992 -induced tumour growth inhibition relative to the vehicle control group.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

More in-depth functionality evaluations were performed for CCK4 [CCKA], MC4, α2- and β1-adrenergic receptors. No agonistic activity of BIBW 2992 was observed on any of the four receptors tested up to concentrations ranging from 10-100 μM (depending on the tested receptor). Compared with the clinical peak exposure, the highest respective test concentrations of BIBW 2992 were &gt;189-, &gt;189-, &gt;63- and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

&gt;6300-fold higher. Furthermore, no antagonistic activity of BIBW 2992 was observed on the α2 adrenergic receptor up to the highest tested concentration of 10 μM. For CCK4 [CCKA], MC4, and β1adrenergic receptors, the respective IC50 concentrations were determined (22 μM, 30 μM, and 47 μM). The values were thus &gt;63-, 139-, 189- and 297- fold higher than the clinical peak exposure of afatinib (158 nM at 50 mg).

## 2.2.3. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The PECsurface water for the already approved NSCLC indication was calculated using the default value for the market penetration (0.01) and the maximum daily dose of 50 mg afatinib is the same for the additional squamous NSCLC indication. The PEC/PNEC ratios calculated for the original approval is valid also in this case:

| Compartment    |   PEC/PNEC ratio [-] |   Trigger for Tier B |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Surface water  |              0.156   |                  1   |
| Microorganisms |              0.00055 |                  0.1 |
| Groundwater    |              0.00046 |                  1   |

The screening for the potential for bioaccumulation/biomagnification as well as the screening for a risk for the terrestrial compartment in the approved ERA for afatinib also revealed no concern.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The submitted non-clinical data has no impact on the benefit-risk assessment and does not result in a need for changes to the product information.

Afatinib is approved for use in patients with tumours with sensitizing EGFR mutations. In the indication applied for, EGFR mutations are rare. The mouse xenograft data show that tumours with wild-type EGFR can be sensitive to afatinib, but also that sensitivity is highly variable. Data were available from only nine xenografts from patients with SQLC, but the analyses conducted are considered comprehensive and properly hypothesis driven and included ligand-receptor loop activation, EGFR mRNA expression, Erb-related gene amplification, however, without positive findings as regards potential predictive value.

## 2.2.5. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

There are no objections to the extension of indication in squamous NSCLC from a non-clinical point of view. The conducted xenograft studies are of obvious interest but the heterogeneity with respect to mutational patterns in SQLC, makes inconclusive findings highly likely. However, an outstanding clinical issue is related to the activity of afatinib in tumours negative by IHC for EGFR expression. The MAH is recommended to address this issue also from a non-clinical perspective.

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of afatinib. Considering the above data, afatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

Study LUX-Lung 8 (1200.125): A randomized, open-label Phase III trial of afatinib versus erlotinib in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as second-line therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy

## Methods

## Study participants

First patient first visit was in March 2013, primary analysis of progression free survival (PFS) was conducted in September 2014, and the overall survival analysis March 2015.

## Key inclusion criteria:

The study was planned to enrol patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC squamous cell histology who have disease progression after completion of at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy treatment in the first-line setting of advanced disease, and who are eligible to receive 2 nd line therapy

- Squamous (or mixed) histology advanced stage NSCLC.
- At least 4 cycles of platinum based doublet.
- Including: Relapse within 6 months after adjuvant treatment.
- Discontinuation due to toxicity (but not PD) after at least 2 cycles
- Measurable disease
- ECOG 0 or 1
- Tumour tissue available
- Adequate organ function

## Key exclusion criteria:

- Prior EGFR directed therapy.
- Active brain metastases

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Significant gastrointestinal disorder
- History or presence of significant cardiovascular disorders

## Treatments

Patients received:

- Afatinib: 40 mg once daily in treatment courses of 28 days. The dose of afatinib was permitted to be escalated to 50 mg at the start of Course 2 in case of minimal toxicity (defined in the study protocol) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

- Erlotinib: 150 mg once daily in treatment courses of 28 days. Patients were to receive continuous daily treatment until the development of progressive disease or unacceptable adverse events.

Prior EGFR directed therapy was not accepted. The erlotinib dose was in accordance with the SmPC.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of afatinib with erlotinib as second-line treatment in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

PFS, as determined by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. One to 5 target lesions (not exceeding 2 lesions per organ) were to be identified at baseline. The central independent review was blinded for relevant data including investigators' selection of target lesions.

Imaging was performed at baseline, and weeks 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter.

Secondary endpoint:

- Overall survival (OS)

- Objective response (defined as complete response [CR], or partial response [PR]) according to RECIST version 1.1

- Disease control (defined as CR, PR, or stable disease [SD]) according to RECIST version 1.1
- Tumour shrinkage

- Health-related Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13 questionnaires and EQ-5D):

- time to deterioration, defined as the time to a 10-point worsening from the baseline score. Patients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of death. Disease progression without scale deterioration will be censored at the time of the last scale measurement. Patients with no HRQoL assessments will be censored at day of randomisation.
- change in cough, dyspnoea and pain scores assessed using a mixed effects growth curve model with the average profile over time for each endpoint described by a piecewise linear. The proportion of patients that are improved will be assessed. Improvement is defined as scores that improve by at least 10 points at any time during the study. All randomized patients will be included in the denominator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- all single items and subscales (functional and symptom) from questionnaires
- usage of cough, dyspnoea, and pain medication
- incidence of cough and dyspnoea AEs

Biomarkers and pharmacogenomic analyses were considered investigational and required a separate consent.

## Sample size

It was estimated that 372 PFS events would provide 90% power for the long-rank test, presuming a hazard ratio of 0.714 for afatinib relative to erlotinib (corresponding to median times of 14 vs. 10 weeks, respectively), with a two-sided α=0.05.

## Randomisation

The randomisation was performed in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by the race of the patient (Eastern Asian vs. Non-Eastern Asian).

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label trial, treated as blinded by the sponsor until the time of the primary PFS analysis database lock.

## Statistical methods

The analysis of PFS considered all data collected until the cut-off date of 07 October 2013, i.e., the estimated date by which 372 PFS events had occurred. Three hundred seventy two was the protocolspecified number of PFS events required for the primary analysis. Overall survival was the key secondary endpoint. The primary analysis of OS will be conducted when 632 death events have occurred.

The alternative hypothesis of the primary analysis was that the progression-free survival time for patients treated with afatinib is different from that of patients who receive erlotinib. That is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The null hypothesis tested by this trial is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where S(t) is the probability that a patient passes time t without dying or experiencing disease progression. The subscripts represent the two treatment groups of either afatinib or erlotinib. The null hypothesis was tested at the two-sided 0.05 level.

Two analysis data sets were defined for this trial, the Randomised Set and the Treated Set.

Randomised Set (RS) : all patients who were randomised, regardless of whether they received investigational treatment. The RS was used for disposition tables and listings, tables for demographic and other baseline characteristics, as well as for the primary evaluation of efficacy.

Treated Set (TS) : all randomised patients who received at least one dose of investigational treatment (i.e., afatinib or erlotinib). Patients were allocated according to treatment actually rece3ived. The TS was used for the safety analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint analysis was performed on the RS. A stratified log-rank test (2 sided, α = 0.05) was used to test for the effect of afatinib on PFS compared with erlotinib. The test was stratified by race (Eastern Asian vs. non-Eastern Asian).

A Cox proportional-hazards model, stratified by race, was used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the two treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% CIs (using Greenwood's standard error estimate) were tabulated at 12-week time points and included a comparison of the treatment arms using a z-test (approximation of the normal distribution). KaplanMeier curves for the two treatment groups were also produced.

## Results

## Participant flow

## Recruitment

At the time of the data cut-off, 835 patients were enrolled at 183 centres in 23 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America and recruitment was ongoing.

## Conduct of the study

The protocol was amended on 24 October 2012. The main change in the conduct of the trial was the inclusion of patients intended for four cycles of chemotherapy but who went off after 2 cycles due to toxicity (not PD) became eligible.

An interim 'futility' analysis was performed after 130 patients of the first 176 patients randomised into

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the trial had experienced PD or death. Objectives: (1) continue accrual until 800 patients had been randomised, as planned; (2) partially curtail accrual to the 500 patients required for the analysis of PFS; or (3) stop accrual for futility, safety, or extreme efficacy (Haybittle-Peto, p &lt;0.0001).

The trial continued to full accrual. The MAH and the trial team remained blinded throughout this process and were notified only of the DMC's final recommendation, but not the analysis result.

## Ancillary analyses

## Disease progression after 1st line chemotherapy

According to the study protocol, patients were eligible if PD was diagnosed after at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Different platinum doublets were used. The cycle time varies between regimens, 3 - 4 weeks. A 28 days cut-off after last administration was used to mark the end of 1st line therapy as chemotherapy is administered in 3-4 week cycles and thus this window is considered as on treatment for the last received chemotherapy. The MAH reviewed the timing of progression on or after platinumbased chemotherapy (see table below).

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

In line with the pivotal study protocol, a dose escalation to a maximum of 50 mg/day may be considered in patients who tolerate a 40 mg/day starting dose (i.e. absence of diarrhoea, skin rash, stomatitis, and other adverse reactions with CTCAE Grade &gt; 1) in the first 28 days of treatment. The 50 mg dose of afatinib was tested in a prior study in first generation TKI refractory patients with the aim to overcome EGFR mutation T790M related resistance. Otherwise 40 mg once daily has been the selected dose in other confirmatory studies. A starting dose of 40 mg with optional increase to 50 mg is considered reasonable

In support of the proposed indication for the treatment of 'patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy' the MAH has conducted a randomised, erlotinib controlled study. Of note, the study was conducted open label.

At time of initiation of the trial in 2013, docetaxel would have been the typical reference therapy, but erlotinib was also licensed for the treatment of patients with NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Recently, a change of importance took place due to the restriction of the indication to switch maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy.

The restriction was due to the negative outcome of the IUNO trial. In this study, early (end of chemotherapy) vs. late erlotinib (at PD) was investigated in patients with NSCLC and at least stable disease after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC were excluded, but patients with both squamous (38%) and non-squamous tumours were eligible.

PFS during the first 'blinded' stage, erlotinib vs. no treatment, showed a HR of 0.94 (unstratified) and 0.87 (stratified). In patients with squamous NSCLC (SQLC) the PFS HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.61; 1.04).

Overall survival (primary endpoint) in this comparison of early vs late erlotinib was negative (stratified analysis HR 1.07, unstratified HR 1.02). This was the case also for patients with SQLC: HR 1.0. This is expected due to planned cross-over and low activity as measured by PFS also in SQLC.

Differences between LUX-Lung 8 and IUNO, in addition to enrolment or not of non-squamous NSCLC, are also related to the inclusion only of patients with progressive disease (PD) in LUX-Lung 8.

Erlotinib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Licensure of erlotinib in this indication was based on the placebo-controlled study BR.21. In patients with SQLC, the OS HR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.5; 0.9). The HR was similar in patients treated with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens.

The outcome of IUNO has casted some doubt on the activity of erlotinib in patients with wild type EGFR NSCLC. The outcome in patients with mutation positive SQLC in BR.21 is not reported separately, but the percentage of EGFR mutation positive was 5% in patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. Later studies with modern technologies have confirmed the low frequency of EGFR mutation positive SQLC. In 2012, the Cancer Genome Atlas reported EGFR mutation positive to be 'rare' in SQLC 8 . There were no cases in 178 samples of del 19 or L858R (the most common alterations in adenocarcinoma), but there were two, in adenocarcinoma NSCLC uncommon mutations being sensitive to erlotinib. Rekhtman et al. screened 95 biomarker-verified SQLCs and found no case of EGFR mutation positive 9 . Altogether, the incidence of EGFR mutation positive in SQLC is too low to explain the positive outcome in patients with SQLC in study BR.21.

Based on these findings, it is still considered appropriate to view erlotinib as an active comparator in LUX-Lung 8, even though PFS in patients with SQLC in the maintenance study IUNO did not reach statistical significance.

As the indication for erlotinib as late line treatment of NSCLC (SQLC and non-SQLC) is restricted to EGFR expressing tumours, data in support of the activity afatinib were requested. In LUX-LUNG 8, however, there were only 60 samples available for EGFR expression analysis. As the estimated proportion of EGFR negative tumours by IHC in patients with SQLC, is about 5% 10 , the sample size did not allow conclusions as regards activity in this subgroup. Thus there is no clinical evidence in support

of activity of afatinib in this subgroup, even though the panErb inhibitory character at least opens for the possibility, in contrast to EGFR targeting MoAbs and erlotinib.

Altogether and in a superiority study there are no objections to the selected reference regimen; erlotinib is sufficiently likely to be active in terms of OS in patients with SCC in the target population of this study.

The conduct of the study as open label is justified by the MAH by differences in the expected toxicity profiles, afatinib being more prone to induce e.g. diarrhoea. Qualitatively, however, the safety profiles are similar and in order to reduce possible bias in the reporting of safety and PRO data it would have been preferable at least to initiate the study as double blind and to unblind assigned treatment when dose reduction was considered.

The primary endpoint was PFS, but mature OS data have been submitted in support. The planned primary PFS analysis showed only statistically borderline results (p=0.04). OS data, however, are considered statistically more robust, p=0.008 based on mature event rates, &gt;75% of the events in the long run.

During the review of the application, the wording of the indication encompassing patients progressing on platinum-based chemotherapy was questioned. The MAH provided further information regarding inclusion of patients with disease progression on or after 1 st  line chemotherapy within the study LUXLung 8 which provided reassurance regarding the targeted patient population.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The HRs for PFS and OS are very similar, meaning that the absolute OS benefit is larger than the PFS benefit. This is not unexpected in NSCLC at hazard ratios not far from 1. Furthermore, there are no signs of imbalances in next-line therapies. The independent and investigator derived HRs for PFS are also very similar despite the higher censoring rates in the independent review.

None of the OS subgroup analyses raise specific concerns. As for most molecules studied in SQLC, no difference in OS between treatment arms was observed in older patients however the activity of erlotinib in older patients with SQLC in study BR.21 has not been reported. As a consequence, information regarding the OS data in older patients has been reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Three PRO instruments (including EQ5D) were used however no primary hypothesis was defined and multiplicity issues were not addressed. In addition, the study was conducted open label. General claims, such as improved physical, role, cognitive and emotional functioning were therefore not accepted and actually found implausible due to the small difference in anti-tumour activity and added adverse reactions. However, a table reporting disease related symptoms (cough, dyspnoea and pain) was accepted for inclusion in the SmPC.

Exploratory, e.g. genetic biomarker analyses, were to be conducted, but have not been reported yet. The As EGFR by IHC has been reported to be of interest for cetuximab activity, at least these data would be of putative value as the survival benefit in the whole study population is modest. The MAH is recommended to conduct genetic biomarker analyses.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Sufficiently methodologically robust study data support the conclusion that a modest survival benefit has been shown in comparison with the licensed medicinal product erlotinib.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety profile of afatinib in the treatment of NSCLC is relatively well characterised based on previously assessed confirmatory NSCLC trials, first-line and after failure on first generation TKIs. The assessment is focused on the results from the LUX-Lung 8 study.

## Patient exposure

By convention Adverse Events included events up to 28 days after end of treatment. About 35% of patients in both study arms initiated next-line therapy during this period of time. The cut-off for AE reporting was March 2015.

The duration of therapy was slightly longer in the afatinib arm: mean 121 vs. 97 days, median 65 vs. 58 days.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea was more frequently reported in the afatinib group (see table above). Time to onset was typically &lt;4 weeks. Altogether 16 patients (4%) in the afatinib group and 6 (1.5%) in the erlotinib group discontinued due to diarrhoea.

The diarrhoea substudy enrolled only 36 + 27 patients. The reported duration of grade 3 diarrhoea was 3 days in the afatinib group.

## Rash

Rather similar between groups (table above). Time to onset was typically &lt; 4 w. Dose reductions due to rash were reported in 6% (afatinib) and 9% (erlotinib) and discontinuations in 2.6% and 2%, respectively.

Of note, among afatinib treated patients, the renal event occurred post treatment in 10 patients and was classified as drug-related in 3 cases. On therapy there were 7 events and 4 were reported as drug-related. One fatal, day 26 post treatment event was reported as drug related.

## Stomatitis

The adverse events of stomatitis were more commonly reported in the afatinib arm, 30% vs. 11% in the erlotinib arm. In three individuals the event was classified as SAE. Dose reductions were reported in 3% in the afatinib arm vs. none, discontinuation 1% in the afatinib arm vs. none.

These events were more commonly reported in the erlotinib arm, but events considered drug-related were reported in similar frequencies. Dose reductions and discontinuations were infrequent, &lt;1% in both study arms. There was one fatal event in the erlotinib arm.

Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations were observed in 1.6% (LUX-Lung 8) of patients with normal baseline liver tests treated with 40 mg/day. There were no Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations in patients with abnormal baseline liver tests in LUX-Lung 8.

## Heart failure (HF)

HF is of potential interest due to HER2 inhibition (afatinib). Of note patients were excluded if there was a 'History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia as determined by the, investigator, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to randomization.'

The overall incidence (about 2%) is rather similar in the study arms and the event was considered drug related in about 1%. Treatment was discontinued in 3+3 individuals.

In the pooled safety data of all patients treated with afatinib monotherapy, the frequency of ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of treated patients.

## Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis has been classified as an important potential risk. There were no cases of pancreatitis identified in the afatinib group. In the erlotinib group, 1 patient experienced a serious post-treatment event of pancreatitis that was considered not related to erlotinib and resolved after 12 days.

Renal AEs were higher among older Afatinib treated patients, with drug related events  observed in less than 5% in either age group. More than half of the renal impairment AEs in afatinib treated patients were defined  by the investigator as not drug related. Review of drug-related renal SAEs due to diarrhoea showed age did not impact the  frequency of renal AEs.

Only 2 patients &gt;70 years of age out of 122 (1.6%) developed diarrhoea related renal  failure (or renal SAEs) indicating that diarrhoea induced pre-renal insufficiency is  manageable in elderly patients.

GI adverse reactions did not show significant differences in the two age groups. Diarrhoea was more frequently reported in elderly patients in both study arms.

## Renal impairment

Afatinib-treated patients with moderately impaired renal function at baseline (creatinine clearance 30 to &lt;60 mL/minute) had a higher overall incidence of AEs as compared to patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥90 mL/minute) or mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 60 to &lt;90 mL/minute). Patients with moderately impaired renal function also reported a higher incidence of diarrhoea and stomatitis, had a higher incidence of Grade 3 AEs and had a higher incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. In the erlotinib group, there were no consistent trends were noted when examining AEs by renal function subgroup.

Altogether 11% vs. 5% of AEs leading to discontinuation were considered drug related by the investigator in the afatinib and erlotinib arms respectively, the difference largely attributable to diarrhoea and stomatitis.

Diarrhoea was the leading cause of dose reduction in the afatinib arm whilst rash dominated in the erlotinib arm.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Afatinib is currently approved in more than 60 countries and the overall cumulative patient exposure to marketed Giotrif is estimated to be 5086 patient-years from July 2013 to March 2015.

In general, the safety pattern in the post-marketing experience has been consistent with that observed in the clinical trials. The majority of the AEs are related to EGFR inhibition (e.g. diarrhoea, rash) and the underlying disease. Characteristics of key risks such as ILD and cardiac disorders have been consistent with clinical trial data.

The adverse event profile of afatinib in LUX Lung 8 is very similar to what has been reported in prior first-line studies. Actually no new safety concerns have been identified. The major benefit from a safety evaluation perspective was the head to head comparison with erlotinib, being a reversible EGFR TK inhibitor. The only major differences are related to diarrhoea, mucositis and paronychia, probably due to the pan ErbB mechanism of action of afatinib. Irrespective of the type of event, most of the new/worsening of events were reported during the first 2 cycles.

The most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 3%) in the afatinib treatment group were pneumonia (6.6%), malignant neoplasm progression (5.9%), diarrhoea (4.6%), dehydration (3.1%), and dyspnoea (3.1%).

In the erlotinib group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 3%) were dyspnoea (7.6%), pneumonia (4.1%), malignant neoplasm progression (4.1%), and respiratory failure (3.0%).

SAEs considered related were more frequently reported in the afatinib arm, 12 vs. 6%. Differences in diarrhoea and dehydration made up for most of this difference.

In relation to the reported fatal events, it is difficult to determine causality: underlying disease, comorbidity, treatment, or an interaction between treatment and disease.

Total AEs leading to death were similar between treatment arms. An apparent increase is seen for infectious events and general disorders in the afatinib arm and in the control, respiratory and cardiovascular. Also 'drug related' events leading to death appear similar without informative patterns.

Further to the CHMP request, the applicant provided data to support the claim that dose reduction would lead to AE grade reduction which was considered acceptable.

About 35% of patients initiated next-line therapy during the 28 days after end of treatment, however, this has not confounded the incidence of AEs.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

No new safety concern has been identified on the basis of the data submitted in support of this application. Available safety data are sufficient to support a risk-benefit assessment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP):

The PRAC considered that the RMP 5.0 (dated 14 December 2015) is acceptable.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

Category 3 studies are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  postauthorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC  also considered that routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

A survival benefit of 1.1 months (6.8 vs. 7.9 m HR=0.81 [95% CI 0.69; 0.95], p=0.008) has been shown over erlotinib. Whilst modest, the data are mature and considered sufficiently robust.

PFS was the primary endpoint and at the primary analysis, the p-value was borderline statistically significant p= 0.043. At time of the updated PFS analysis, the p-value for the independent review analysis was 0.01 and the HR=0.8 (95% CI, 0.69; 0.96). The absolute benefit in terms of difference in medians was small (1.9 vs. 2.4 m.).

With respect to PRO data, it is accepted that descriptive information related to symptom control are included in section 5.1 of the SmPC despite deficiencies in the planning of the study.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The MAH has reported extensive data derived from analyses using the Foundation One Next generation sequencing platform and human explants mouse xenografts. No biomarkers, however, have been identified of predictive value. This is perhaps not surprising due to the extreme heterogeneity in SQCL as regards putative driving and passenger mutations. Thus available data do not at this stage allow the identification of patients likely to derive more benefit from the treatment with afatinib and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

applicant is recommended to further investigate genetic biomarkers of efficacy.

No OS benefit over erlotinib has been shown in patients above 65 (70) years of age and the activity of erlotinib in older patients with SQLC is unknown (Tarceva EPAR).

Even though there is a potential for anti-tumour activity of this panErb inhibitor in patients with SQLC with EGFR negative tumours by IHC, the efficacy of afatinib has not been established.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most frequently reported grade 3 ADRs in the pivotal trial were diarrhoea (9.9%), rash (5.4%), stomatitis (4.1%) and decreased appetite (3.1%).

A benefit from the perspective of the assessment of safety is the comparison of this pan ErbB inhibitor with erlotinib an ErbB1 (EGFR-TK) inhibitor. This comparison reveals a clear increase in diarrhoea, mucositis and paronychia at rather similar levels of rash/acne.

The safety profile as documented in prior studies remains essentially unaltered.

Altogether 9% vs. 4% (afatinib vs. erlotinib) of AEs leading to discontinuation were considered drug related by the investigator, the difference largely attributable to diarrhoea and stomatitis.  Overall 18 vs. 14% discontinued due to AEs. Taking number of patients at risk, there was no difference between study arms.

Dose reductions were undertaken in about 24 and 12% of patients treated with afatinib and erlotinib, respectively.

It has been clearly shown that dose reductions lead to reduction of stomatitis and diarrhoea.

Diarrhoea is the main concerns from a tolerability perspective and dehydration and pre-renal renal events have been reported, but at a rather low level also in patients above 70 years of age.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Missing data as regards patients with non-trivial heart disorders remains a potential concern due to inhibition of HER2/ErbB2.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefit-risk balance

Mature and reliable survival data have been provided and the safety profile of afatinib, taking prior confirmatory studies into account, is considered sufficiently well documented for a benefit - risk assessment. Overall, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive in view of the survival advantage and acceptable toxicity profile.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The benefit-risk balance of Giotrif in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy is considered positive. The MAH is recommended to further investigate the activity/efficacy of afatinib according to biomarkers (in particular EGFR status).

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:
