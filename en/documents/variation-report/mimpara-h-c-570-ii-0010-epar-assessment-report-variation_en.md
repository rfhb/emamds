## 1. Introduction

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) maintains normal serum calcium levels by mobilising calcium from bone, by reabsorption of calcium from the renal tubular fluid and by increased gastrointestinal absorption of calcium through stimulation of renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.

Cinacalcet (Mimpara) is a calcimimetic, i. e. it belongs to a class of small organic synthetic molecules that act as allosteric modulators of the calcium receptor (CaR) on the cell surface of the parathyroid gland  cells.  Calcimimetics  can  regulate  PTH  secretion  by  amplifying  the  receptor  sensitivity  to extracellular calcium and thereby reducing PTH, resulting in a decrease in serum calcium levels.

The CaR is activated by elevated calcium concentrations and this activation signals inhibition of PTH secretion. Decreased serum calcium inhibits CaR, thereby stimulating PTH secretion.

Worldwide, cinacalcet is approved in 36 countries, including the US and the EU, for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis and for the treatment of hypercalcaemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.

When cinacalcet was approved within the EU in 2004, the CHMP considered the indication for use in patients  with  parathyroid  carcinoma  to  be  approvable  while  the  proposed  indication  'patients  with intractable primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy is not a treatment option' was not considered to be sufficiently well defined to support approval based on the limited data submitted in support of this indication. At the time of the initial application for cinacalcet, study 20000204 included results from 10 subjects with parathyroid carcinoma and 5 subjects with intractable primary HPT.

In 2005 the MAH submitted the interim results from study 20000204 and in May 2006 the final results from this study. The CHMP concluded that the assessment of these data showed that: ' The treatment is  clearly  of  benefit  for  patients  with  parathyroid  carcinoma  even  though  the  interindividual variability  seems  to  be  rather  large.  Also  patients  with  intractable  primary  HPT  have  a  benefit  of cinacalcet treatment. The patients are still rather few, but  the results are clearly positive .'

The MAH now therefore submits final data from the 20000204 study plus additional supportive data from the four other completed clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate primary HPT.

The  aim  of  the  variation  is  to  introduce  a  new  indication,  ' primary  HPT  in  patients  with  primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated '.  Some subsequent changes of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 are also suggested, plus a major revision of the PL.

The MAH has submitted an updated Pharmacovigilance System and a new Risk Management Plan (version 1.0).

## 2. Clinical aspects

## Rationale for the proposed change

Parathyroidectomy  is  the  only  curative  treatment  for  primary  HPT  and  is  very  successful  in experienced hands. Serum PTH as well as serum and urinary calcium are normalised after successful parathyroidectomy,  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  is  normalised,  the  risk  of  fracture  and  of  kidney stone formation is reduced as is the risk of cardiovascular disease; in addition the quality of life (QoL) as well as survival is improved.

Parathyroidectomy is recommended for patients with symptomatic HPT. In the US, the NIH in 2002 published a workshop on symptomatic primary HPT, with guidelines for criteria for surgery in these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

asymptomatic patients. According to these guidelines, patients who have symptoms of primary HPT (history of kidney stones) or meet one or more of the following criteria should undergo surgery:

- serum calcium &gt; 1 mg/dl above the upper limit of normal  (ULN)
- 24-hour urine calcium excretion &gt; 400 mg
- 30 % reduction in creatinine clearance compared with age-matched controls
- BMD T-score &lt; -2.5 at the lumbar spine, hip or distal 1/3 radius
- age &lt; 50 years

No approved medical therapy for primary HPT exists in the EU.

Clinical  trials  carried  out  outside  the  European  Union  meet  the  ethical  requirements  of  Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 3. Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

Three randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies were performed on patients with primary HPT plus one open label extension study for these studies plus one open-label pivotal study in patients with parathyroid cancer or intractable primary HPT (see table 1).

QD:  once daily; BID:  twice daily; iPTH:  intact parathyroid hormone

a Forty  subjects  (32  cinacalcet,  8  placebo)  were  enrolled  in  the  QD  phase  of  this  study.    Twenty-two  subjects  (16 cinacalcet, 6 placebo) were enrolled in the BID phase of this study.  Eight subjects (7 cinacalcet, 1 placebo) in the BID phase had not participated in the QD phase.

b Twenty-two subjects who enrolled in Study 990120 had previously participated in Study 980125.

c All subjects had participated in Study 990120 before enrolling in Study 20000159.

d Before  July  2004,  subjects  titrated  from  30  mg  BID  to  50  mg  BID.    After  July  2004,  because  of  a  change  in  dose strengths,  subjects  instead  titrated  from  30  mg  BID  to  60  mg  BID.    Ongoing  subjects  receiving  50 mg  BID  were switched at that time to 60 mg BID.  Subjects receiving 30 mg BID had the option to reduce to 30 mg QD, if necessary.

e Twenty-nine subjects with parathyroid carcinoma and 17 subjects with intractable primary HPT participated in Study 20000204.

Studies 980125, 990120 and 990160 included patients with primary HPT defined on the basis of both PTH and calcium  concentrations.  Studies  990120  and  990160  requested  patients  to  have  an  iPTH concentration &gt; 45 pg/ml and study 98 0125 had iPTH ≥ 45 pg/ml as an inclusion criterion. For studies 990120 and 980125, serum calcium concentration had to be &gt; 10.3 and ≤ 12.5 mg/dl while in study 990160 it was to be ≥ 11 mg/dL. Study 20000159 enrolled patients who had completed the protocolspecific  treatment  for  the  parent  cinacalcet  study  990120.  Study  20000204  included  subjects  with more  severe  disease,  parathyroid  carcinoma  or  intractable  primary  HPT,  with  serum  calcium concentration &gt; 12.5 mg/dL. This study was an open study as placebo was not considered ethical for this group of severely ill patients; the study had no inclusion criteria related to iPTH.

## Endpoints of the main studies

All five studies on primary HPT assessed the absolute values and percentage changes in calcium and iPTH concentrations over time. The primary endpoint of study 990120 was the proportion of subjects with a mean serum calcium concentration ≤ 10.3 mg/dl and a mean decrease in serum calcium of at least  0.5  mg/dl  during  the  maintenance  phase.  In  study  20000204,  the  primary  endpoint  was  the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 1 mg/dl reduction in serum calcium from baseline to the end of titration phase.

## Study 20000204

This study enrolled the first patient in April 2001 and the last patient was discontinued in September 2005.  The  study  was  a  multicentre,  open-label,  single-arm,  dose-titration  study  consisting  of  three parts:  a  30-day  screening  period,  a  variable-length  titration  phase  of  two  to  sixteen  seeks  and  a maintenance phase. During the titration  phase,  assessments  of  serum  calcium  took  place  at  weekly visits. The initial cinacalcet dose was 30 mg twice daily (BID) and then titration was done every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily (QID). Dose escalation was halted when the subject reached a serum calcium concentration of 10 mg/dl or the subject reached the maximum study dose or an adverse  event  (AE)  precluded  further  dose  escalation.  Dose  adjustments  were  permitted during the maintenance phase according to the same procedures as during the titration phase. For key inclusion criteria, see table 1. For ethical reasons, no placebo group was included in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients

Study centres in the US (15), France (3), Italy (3), Canada (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1) recruited a  total  of  46  patients  in  the  study,  29  (63  %)  with  parathyroid  carcinoma  and  17  (63  %)  with intractable primary HPT.

## Objectives of study 20000204

The primary objective was to assess the ability of cinacalcet to reduce serum calcium concentrations, recorded as the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 1 mg/dl reduction in serum calcium from baseline to the end of titration phase.

Secondary objectives were:

- To assess the effect of cinacalcet on plasma iPTH concentration
- To assess the effect of cinacalcet on the bone turnover markers serum N-telopeptide (Ntx) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP)
- To assess the long-term safety of cinacalcet in this population
- To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cinacalcet in this population
- To assess the effect of cinacalcet on patient reported outcome (PRO) domains

## Statistics

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize safety and efficacy data.

a Includes one patient who discontinued after the titration phase, prior to the maintenance phase

Only 3 patients in this study were identified by the investigator as having contraindications to surgery.

Discontinuation  rate  was  high,  especially  among  patients  with  parathyroid  carcinoma  which  could partly be explained by the mortality rate in this group of severely ill patients.

Serum calcium levels, plasma iPTH, serum phosphorus, BALP and NTx at baseline were higher in patients with parathyroid carcinoma than in those with intractable primary HPT. Standard deviations were great.

## Efficacy results

Efficacy data are given for the intent-to-treat population. No extrapolation of missing values was used for the maintenance phase.

The  greatest  reductions  in  serum  calcium  levels  were  noted  in  patients  with  the  highest  baseline calcium concentrations (in subjects with parathyroid carcinoma).

Figure 1. Proportion of subjects with serum calcium reduction ≥ 1 mg/dl at the end of titration phase

<!-- image -->

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  serum  calcium  reduced  by ≥ 1  mg/dl  remained  relatively  stable through the maintenance phase, ranging from 60 % to 86 % for subjects with parathyroid carcinoma and from 67 to 83 % for subjects with intractable primary HPT.

Figure  2.  Mean  serum  calcium  concentrations  at  each  scheduled  visit  during  the  titration  phase (Standard Error = SE)

<!-- image -->

Study patients achieved modest but significant reductions of their serum calcium levels. Patients with intractable primary HPT had a faster reduction of their serum calcium levels during the titration phase than  patients  with  parathyroid  cancer.  Both  patient  categories  remained  relatively  stable  during  the maintenance phase. Interindividual variations were great, especially among patients with intractable primary HPT.

Plasma iPTH concentrations at baseline  were  highly  variable and  no  consistent  changes  in  predose plasma  iPTH  concentrations  were  seen  during  the  titration  phase.  Plasma  iPTH  concentrations  at baseline  and  at  the  end  of  the  titration  phase  were  697  (SE  93.9)  pg/ml  and  593  (SE  67.7)  pg/ml respectively, for patients with parathyroid carcinoma. The mean change from baseline was -6.1 % (SE 7.27 %). Subjects with intractable primary HPT had mean plasma iPTH concentrations at baseline and the end of the titration phase of 243 (SE 26.3) pg/ml and 396 (SE 158.2) pg/ml, respectively, and for these  patients,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -2.5  %  (SE  13.65  %).  The  mean  plasma  iPTH concentrations during the maintenance phase were similar to those observed at the end of the titration phase.

Serum NTx was generally increased or constant over the titration phase. Mean (SE) serum NTx at baseline and at the end of the titration phase were 110.3 (26.7) nM and 142.9 (37.8) nM, respectively, for patients with parathyroid carcinoma. For subjects with intractable primary HPT, mean (SE) serum NTx concentrations at baseline and at the end of the titration phase were 78.8 (38.5) nM and 168.1 (118.9)  nM,  respectively.  During  the  maintenance  phase,  mean  serum  NTx  concentrations  did  not change  notably  from  the  end  of  the  titration  phase  in  subjects  with  parathyroid  carcinoma  but decreased among subjects with intractable primary HPT.

Serum BALP concentrations generally increased or remained constant over the titration  phase.  For subjects with parathyroid carcinoma, mean (SE) serum BALP concentrations at baseline and the end of the titration phase were 72.6 (20.6) ng/mL and 114.2 (28.9) ng/ml, respectively. For subjects with intractable  primary  HPT,  mean  (SE)  serum  BALP  concentrations  at  baseline  and  the  end  of  the titration  phase  were  60.4  (27.7)  ng/ml  and  82.2 (37.0)  ng/ml,  respectively.  During  the  maintenance phase, mean serum BALP concentrations did not change notably from the end of the titration phase in subjects with parathyroid carcinoma but decreased among subjects with intractable primary HPT.

PK assessments: The limited exposure data obtained in this study was consistent with the previously obtained PK profile of cinacalcet. Across subjects, cinacalcet concentrations appeared to increase with increasing dose. As expected, the frequent dosing utilized in this study resulted in low peak-to trough fluctuation  and  notable  accumulation  of  cinacalcet. At  the end  of  the titration  phase,  iPTH concentrations at both 2 and 4 hours postdose were lower than the predose concentration, suggesting that cinacalcet can elicit a transient reduction in iPTH in these populations. Although serum calcium levels  decreased  from  day  1  to  the  end  of  the  titration  phase,  calcium  levels  remained  relatively constant over the 4 hour sampling period on both sampling days.

Quality of life: At baseline, the patients with parathyroid carcinoma or intractable primary HPT had relatively poor functional status, 1 SD below the mean for a US population on the SF-36 QoL scale. The Physical Component Summary score was more than 1 SD below the general population mean in both  populations.  The  Mental  Component  Summary  score  was  more  than  1  SD  below  the  general population  mean  only  for  the  patient  group  with  intractable  primary  HPT.  Most  scales  showed minimal improvement at the end of titration phase for subjects with parathyroid carcinoma. Of the 15 subjects  with  evaluable  data  in  this  group,  27  to  67  %  had  an  improvement  at  the  end  of  titration, depending on the scale. Among subjects with intractable primary HPT, all mean scale scores improved from baseline. Of the 15 subjects in this group, 33 to 80 % had an improvement at the end of titration, depending on scale.

Results for bone turnover markers were insignificant as these were PK results. There was a positive trend  for  QoL  parameters,  especially  for  patients  with  intractable  primary  PTH.  However,  study 20000204  did  not  have  a  control  group  and  in  addition,  a  large  number  of  post-baseline  QoL assessments  were  incomplete  which  makes  definitive  evaluation  of  QoL  data  from  this  study impossible.

## Analysis performed across trials

Integrated analyses of data from studies 980125, 990120, 990160 and 10000159 were performed to provide support for the efficacy of cinacalcet in the now proposed additional indication, analysing the ability  of  cinacalcet  to  decrease  elevated  serum  calcium  and  iPTH  concentrations  in  the  following categories of subjects:

- Patients with persistent or recurrent primary HPT after parathyroidectomy, 'failed parathyroidectomy' = category 1

· Patients who met at least one criterion (according to the NIH criteria) for consideration of surgical intervention  but  had  not  undergone  a  parathyroidectomy,  'indicated  for  parathyroidectomy'  = category 2

- All other study participants = category 3

About  46  %  of  the  subjects  in  these  4  studies  fulfilled  at  least  one  criterion  for  consideration  of surgical  intervention  but  had  not  undergone  parathyroidectomy.  It  should  be  noted  that  data  on medical contraindications to surgery were not collected in 3 of these 4 studies.

Although  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  of  these  studies  varied,  the  studies  all  assessed  the absolute values and percentage changes in calcium and iPTH concentrations over time. Most studies also assessed the proportion of subjects who reduced their serum calcium to within normal limits. Statistics:  Descriptive  statistics  was  used  for  the  studies  on  primary  HPT.  In  studies  980125  and 990120, hypothesis testing was also performed.

Efficacy  results  of  each  of  the  studies  in  the  broader  primary  HPT  population  are  presented  as representative  of  the  effects  of  cinacalcet  in  the  narrower  population  included  in  the  proposed  new indication.  Two  sets  of  integrated  analyses  were  performed.  The  first  set  assessed  efficacy  over  6 months, using all data from studies 980125 and 990160 plus data from the 12-week titration and 12week maintenance phases of study 990120. The other set assessed efficacy over 5.75 years, using all data from studies 990120 and 20000159.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For each integrated dataset, absolute concentrations and percentage changes from baseline over time were  summarized  for  serum  calcium  and  plasma  iPTH  concentrations.  The  proportion  of  subjects having a decrease in serum calcium concentration to within the normal range (8.4 - 10.3 mg/dl) at each study visit and the proportion of subjects having a ≥ 1 mg/dl reduction from baseline in serum calcium concentration at each study visit were summarised.

Patients  in  studies  980125,  990120,  990160  and  10000159  had  mild  or  moderate  primary  HPT,  in contrast to patients in study 20000204, who had a more severe disease, according to inclusion criteria in the studies. Also, the patients in study 20000204 had a variable length titration phase. The efforts made to pick out patients who are supposed to have a contraindication to surgery from primary HPT studies other than 20000204 can be questioned as data were not collected prospectively.

All cinacalcet groups had an immediate decrease in serum calcium concentration from baseline that was  maintained  during  the  study  period,  although  with  great  inter-individual  variations  and  great standard errors.

There was no significant difference in plasma iPTH concentrations between cinacalcet treated patients and  placebo  treated  patients  in  pooled  data  from  studies  980125  +  990160  and  990120  for  patient categories 1, 2 and 3 (see p 11). Standard errors were great.

There was a trend towards higher long term values for iPTH in patients indicated for parathyroidectomy but not operated and for patients with failed parathyroidectomy compared to all others. Again, standard errors were great.

## 4. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

On the cut-off data of the most recent PSUR report, 28 February 2007, the worldwide postmarketing exposure to cinacalcet up to 28 February 2007 is estimated to 138.354 patient-years.

The number of subjects who received cinacalcet and the number of subjects who received placebo in the five studies performed to evaluate cinacalcet in subjects with primary HPT are presented by study in Table 1.

## Study 20000204

## Adverse events

Twenty-four (83 %) parathyroid carcinoma patients and 15 patients with intractable HPT (88 %) had AEs that were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related. The most common treatmentrelated AEs ( ≥ 10 %) included nausea, vomiting and paresthesia. The overall incidence of treatmentrelated AEs was similar among subjects with parathyroid cancer and subjects with intractable primary HPT.

Altogether nine subjects withdrew from the study due to AEs. Five patients with parathyroid cancer withdrew  due  to  AEs  including  nausea,  vomiting,  hypercalcaemia  and  urticaria,  Four  patients  with intractable primary HPT  withdrew  due  to AEs  including nausea, vomiting, hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, muscle weakness and neoplasm.

Nausea and  vomiting  were  the  most  common  AEs.  The  pattern  of  AEs  did  not  differ  between  the patient groups.

## Serious adverse events and deaths (study 20000204)

Eight deaths (7 patients with parathyroid cancer, 1 with intractable primary HPT) occurred in study 20000204. The fatal events were recorded as due to cardiac arrest (2) and one case each of cardiac failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypotension, metastatic neoplasm and multi-organ failure. The fatal outcome for the patient with intractable primary PTH was initially coded as arrhythmia but later re-classified as heart failure as cause of death. Narratives were provided for all these patients. None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the investigational product.

Twenty  subjects  with  parathyroid  cancer  (69  %)  and  6  with  intractable  primary  HPT  (35  %) experienced  SAEs.  Four  of  the  subjects  with  carcinoma  had  SAEs  that  were  considered  by  the investigator  to  be  treatment-related,  including  nausea  and  dehydration;  vomiting  and  dehydration; hypercalcaemia, anorexia and asthenia; hypercalcaemia, dehydration and hypokalaemia.

## Laboratory findings

No trends indicating  treatment-related  effects  were  seen  for  other  laboratory  values  than  for  serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Elevated mean serum ALP concentrations were seen from baseline to the end of the titration phase. At baseline, the mean serum ALP concentration was 187.5 U/l and at the end of the titration phase, the mean ALP concentration was 284.5 U/l.

The CHMP agreed with the MAH that these elevations are due to cross-reactivity of the enzyme assay with  the  BALP  isoform  as  no  SGOT/SGPT  or  clinical  sign  of  hepatic  or  biliary  symptoms  were observed.

## Analysis performed across trials

## Adverse events

The  safety  profile  of  cinacalcet  was  similar  across  the  five  studies  in  patient  with  primary  HPT although subjects with intractable primary HPT or parathyroid carcinoma in study 20000204 tended to have a greater incidence of nausea and, in particular, of vomiting than subjects in the other studies.

However, patients  in  study  990160  also  had  a  high  incidence  of  nausea.  This  can  be  explained  as subjects  in  studies  990160  and  20000204  had  higher  baseline  serum  calcium  concentrations  than subjects in the other studies and hypercalcaemia can cause nausea. Nausea is also a known common adverse reaction associated with cinacalcet.

In  the  double-blind  studies  980125,  990120  and  990160,  nausea,  dizziness,  fatigue,  diarrhoea  and paraesthesia were reported to be more common in the cinacalcet groups than in the placebo groups. The most common AE was nausea. These events are mentioned as common adverse effects in the SPC for cinacalcet. Most of these adverse effects are related to the calcium-lowering effect of cinacalcet.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

The only SAEs reported in the double-blind studies occurred in study 990120. In this study, 8 % of patients  in  both  the  cinacalcet  and  the  placebo  groups  experienced  SAEs.  These  SAEs  were:  neck pain, sepsis, renal calculus (2), diverticulosis and dislocation. None of these SAEs were considered by the  investigator  to  be  treatment-related.  In  study  20000159,  8  subjects  (38  %)  who  had  received cinacalcet in the prior study and 8 (33 %) who had earlier received placebo had SAEs. One subject in each  prior  treatment  group  experienced  syncope.  None  of  the  SAEs  in  this  study  were  considered related to investigational drug by the investigator.

Two subjects died during the long-term extension study 20000159. The cause of death was metastatic colon cancer in one of the patient and cerebral ischemia in the other patient. None of these deaths was considered by the investigator to be related to cinacalcet.

## Laboratory findings

With  the  exceptions  of  serum  calcium  and  serum  phosphorus,  no  clinically  relevant  trends  in laboratory parameters were seen in subjects with primary HPT or parathyroid carcinoma.

Serum phosphorus concentrations were increased with cinacalcet due to renal retention of phosphorus caused by reduced PTH levels. The mean phosphorus concentrations still remain within the normal range, 2.2 to 5.1 mg/dl. Urine volume and urine calcium excretion were recorded in study 990120.

This study enrolled patients with normal kidney function (creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min) and no effect of cinacalcet on urine volume or urine calcium excretion over 24 hours was seen during 1 year of measurement.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety in special populations

Safety was not found to be different between the study subgroups: failed previous parathyroidectomy, indicated for parathyroidectomy and others in the studies for primary HPT. Children, adolescents or pregnant women were not included in any of the cinacalcet clinical studies.

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  (version  2.1)  as  described  by  the  MAH fulfils the legislative requirements.

Annex II has been updated accordingly.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAH submitted a Risk Management Plan (version 1.0).

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 6. Changes in the Product Information

Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated as a consequence to the addition of the new indication.

There has been a substantial revision of the Package Leaflet further to the results of the readability testing performed in October 2007. The list of local representatives has been updated.

In  addition,  the  MAH  has  submitted  the  Pharmacovigilance  System  (version  2.1)  and  a  new  Risk Management Plan (version 1.0). Annex II has been updated to reflect this.

## 7. Overall conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The treatment of choice for primary HPT is surgical parathyroidectomy. However, there is a limited number of patients for whom surgery for various reasons is not achievable. At present, no approved medical treatment exists in the EU for these patients with primary HPT.

Study 20000204 provides evidence that cinacalcet has a beneficial effect in patients with surgically intractable  HPT,  even  if  the  individual  variability  is  large.  Twenty-nine  patients  with  parathyroid carcinoma,  fourteen  patients  with  failed  parathyroidectomy  and  three  patients  with  documented medical  contraindication  for  surgery  were  included  in  this  study.  Even  if  the  number  of  included patients  is  still  small,  the  mean  observation  time  in  the  study  was  328  days  for  patients  with parathyroid cancer and 347 days for patients with primary intractable HPT.

This relatively long observation time plus the circumstance that the pattern of adverse effects was not different  from  what  has  been  observed  in  patients  with  other,  earlier  approved  indications,  are favourable  for  an  approval  of  an  indication  for  cinacalcet  in  primary  HPT  patients  for  whom parathyroidectomy is indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not feasible. When pooling data from studies 980125, 990120, 990160 and 10000159, altogether 21 patients with failed parathyroidectomy and 38 patients with primary HPT and at least one indication for surgery but not operated were identified. Even if these  studies  were  not  designed  to  evaluate  data  from  patients  refractory  to  or  contraindicated  for curative parathyroid surgery, the pooled data for primary HPT patients with failed parathyroidectomy or indicated for surgery but not operated give some support to the conclusions from study 20000204.

The risk/benefit ratio is considered to be positive for the indication 'reduction of hypercalcaemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on  the  basis  of  serum  calcium  levels  (as  defined  by  relevant  treatment  guidelines),  but  in  whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated'.

## 8. Conclusion

On 24 April 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
