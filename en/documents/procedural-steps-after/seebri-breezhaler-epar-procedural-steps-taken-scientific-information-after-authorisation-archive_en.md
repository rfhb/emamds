| WS/0456   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to accurately reflect the percentage of cases of dry mouth and section 5.1 to revise the p-values of trough FEV1 and the information on the reduction of COPD exacerbations in the pivotal studies A2304 and A2303. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template, to make minor editorial changes and to include the black triangle to reflect that the product is under additional monitoring. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | 18/12/2013   | 19/06/2014 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The clinical phase III development program for glycopyrronium bromide included two pivotal studies: a 6- month placebo-controlled study (CNVA237A2304) and a 12-month placebo and active-controlled (open label tiotropium 18 micrograms once daily) study (CNVA237A2303), both in patients with clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. The SmPC reflects the primary endpoint trough FEV1 for glycopyrronium bromide compared to placebo at the 6-month time-point (108mL) for study A2304 and at the 12-month time-point (97mL) for study A2303. In order to more precisely reflect the study results, the p-values for both studies are being changed from p<0.05 to p<0.001 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In addition, the information related to the reduction of COPD exacerbations is being revised in section 5.1 of the SmPC to improve clarity and accuracy. The percentage of cases of 'dry mouth' reported for glycopyrronium bromide compared to placebo is 2.4% versus 1.1% for the MedDRA Preferred Term 'dry throat'. This was changed in order to reflect the actual number of patients with the MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) 'dry mouth' in the 6-month database i.e. 2.2% versus 1.1% in accordance with the EPAR. |
