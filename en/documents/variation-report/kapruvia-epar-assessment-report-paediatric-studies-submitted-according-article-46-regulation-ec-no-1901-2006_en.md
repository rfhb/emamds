## 2.3.2. Clinical study

KOR-PED-201, 'An Open-label, Single Arm Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of a Single Dose of Intravenous Difelikefalin in Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years on Haemodialysis'.

## Description

The primary objective of KOR-PED-201 study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single dose of difelikefalin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years on HD, and the secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of difelikefalin in this population.

## Methods

KOR-PED-201 was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study. A single dose of difelikefalin was administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus based on 0.5 μg/kg of dry body weight on Day 1 within 15 minutes after completion of HD treatment on the first HD treatment of the calendar week (HD #1). The expected duration of subject participation was up to 32 days, including a:

1. Screening period (up to 21 days), during which informed consent was obtained; demographics, medical history, and prior and concomitant medications were recorded; a physical examination was performed; height, prescription dry body weight, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG were measured; serum pregnancy test was performed, haematology, and serum chemistry were assessed; and eligibility was determined.
2. PK period (3 days), with 3 visits (on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3). Study drug was administered on Day
1. The Day 1 visit also included confirmation of eligibility, safety assessments, PK blood sampling, recording concomitant medications, and vital signs. The Day 2 visit included safety assessments, PK blood sampling, recording concomitant medications, and vital signs. Day 3 was also the day of the second HD treatment and included safety assessments, PK blood sampling, recording concomitant medications, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG.
3. Follow-up period 7 (up to 10) days after study drug administration. The follow-up visit included recording concomitant medications and any AEs.

All post-dose PK samples were to be obtained from a venous access different than the one used to administer the study drug, see table below. On Day 1, samples were to be obtained pre-dose, and at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 6 hours post-dose (6 samples in total). On Day 2, a sample was to be obtained at 24 hours post-dose given on Day 1, and on Day 3 a sample was to be obtained 44 or 48 hours after study drug administration on Day 1 but before the second HD treatment and a second sample was to be obtained within 5 minutes after the second HD treatment.

PK sampling time points are presented in the table:

## Pharmacokinetic analysis

Concentration-time data for difelikefalin were analysed using noncompartmental methods in Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 8.3.4, Certara, L.P.) in conjunction with Certara IntegralTM (Version 23.4.1, Certara USA, Inc.). Integral provides protected and structured storage, audit trails, and version control for study data, analyses, and related files, supporting 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. During the PK analysis, concentrations BLQ up to the time of the first quantifiable concentration were treated as zero. Embedded (values between 2 quantifiable concentrations) and terminal BLQ concentrations were treated as 'missing'.

Main PK-parameters calculated:

Tmax, Cmax, C44, AUCinf, AUC0-48, AUClast, T½, CL, Vz, and ERd.

Bioanalytical method: Plasma samples were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method difelikefalin with a validated lower limit of quantitation of 0.0500 ng/ml for difelikefalin

## Study participants and Participant flow

Planned: at least 6 subjects evaluable for the PK endpoint

Screened: 10 subjects

Received study treatment: 8

Completed: 8 subjects

Analysed: 8 subjects in the Safety Set and 7 subjects in the PK Set

## Results

As planned in the SAP, a descriptive comparison of most relevant PK parameters in adolescents (this study) and adults (from the previous CR845-CLIN2005 study) is shown in Table 14, see below. Cmax, AUC0-48, and AUCinf values in KOR-PED-201 and in the previous study in an adult HD population (CR845CLIN2005) after administration of 1 dose of difelikefalin 0.5 μg/kg of dry body weight were as follows:

- Mean (95% confidence intervals) Cmax was 6.03 (4.36 to 7.71) ng/ml for adolescents (KORPED-201) and 5.43 (4.19 to 6.68) ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).
- Median (range) Cmax was 6.57 (3.56 to 8.07) ng/ml for adolescents (KOR-PED-201) and 5.35 (3.36 to 7.04) ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).
- Mean (95% confidence intervals) AUC0-48 was 63.4 (47.4 to 79.5) h*ng/ml for adolescents (KOR-PED-201) and 56.5 (42.0 to 71.0) h*ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).
- Median (range) AUC0-48 was 62.8 (38.1 to 87.2) h*ng/ml for adolescents (KOR-PED-201) and 56.1 (36.6 to 78.3) h*ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Mean (95% confidence intervals) AUCinf was 72.5 (50.6 to 94.4) h*ng/ml for adolescents (KOR-PED-201) and 81.0 (50.1 to 111.9) h*ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).
- Median (range) AUCinf was 73.0 (39.8 to 100) h*ng/ml for adolescents (KOR-PED-201) and 81.0 (39.2 to 119.3) h*ng/ml for adults (CR845-CLIN2005).

Intersubject variability (measured using CV%) was generally comparable for adolescent and adult HD populations for Cmax, AUC0-48, and AUCinf, ranging from 27.4% to 32.6% in adolescents (KOR-PED201) and from 24.9% to 41.3% in adults (CR845-CLIN2005) (Table 14).

In this study in adolescents (KOR-PED-201), mean (SD) total clearance was 5.71 (1.76) ml/min. Mean T1/2 in adolescents was 15.4 (4.44) hours, lower than in CR845-CLIN2005 study in adults: 24.4 (12.6) hours; however, large SDs should be noted for this parameter especially for the study in adults (Table 13 and [11]).

Conclusion: The PK profile following administration of 1 difelikefalin dose of 0.5 μg/kg, based on dry body weight, in adolescents on HD (KOR-PED-201) was comparable to that in adults on HD (CR845CLIN2005). In particular, this was shown in a pre-specified numerical comparison of the median and 95%. confidence intervals for the mean for Cmax, AUC0-48, and AUCinf values. Theoverall drug exposure following administration of 1 dose of difelikefalin of 0.5 μg/kg, based on dry body weight, was found to be comparable between adolescents and adults on HD.

## Safety results

The Safety Set included 3 (37.5%) males and 5 (62.5%) females. Mean age at informed consent was 15.0 years; minimum age was 12 years and maximum age 17 years. The majority of subjects in the Safety Set were White (75.0%) and all were not Hispanic or Latino (100%). Mean dry body weight and body-mass index (BMI) were 44.6 kg and 21.0 kg/m2, respectively. The mean (SD) time since onset of (chronic kidney disease) CKD was 4.8 (4.14) years and the mean (SD) time since first HD was 3.3 (3.09) years. The most commonly reported primary reason for CKD was classified as 'other' (5 [62.5%] subjects). Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for the PK set.

In the Safety Set, medical and surgical history was reported in 7 (87.5%) subjects. The most common medical and surgical history terms by SOC were blood and lymphatic system disorders (75.0% of subjects) and surgical and medical procedures (50.0% of subjects). The most common medical and surgical history terms by PT were nephrogenic anaemia (62.5% of subjects) and hypertension (37.5% of subjects). Medical history was similar for the PK Set.

Eight subjects received a single difelikefalin dose of 0.5 μg/kg of dry body weight and were part of the Safety Set.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no deaths and no serious TEAEs reported during the study.

2 TEAEs were reported in 1 (12.5%) subject. Both TEAEs were nervous system disorders (1 event each of headache and dizziness) and started 2 minutes after study drug administration. These TEAEs were considered mild and possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. Both events resolved and no action was taken with the study drug. The event of dizziness was also considered a TEAESI. No TEAEs led to study withdrawal.

Laboratory parameters were consistent with the underlying condition of this population (CKD on HD) and abnormal values were generally considered as NCS. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory parameters (creatinine and urea nitrogen) were reported in 1 subject overall.

Vital signs showed no trends or clinically relevant changes over time. Physical examination findings at Screening were normal except for clinically significant abnormal findings in 1 (12.5%) subject in the body systems of general appearance, skin, and abdomen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ECG parameters were generally stable from Baseline to Day 3. There was a decrease in mean (SD) PR interval from 206.8 (218.74) milliseconds at Baseline to 133.4 (28.56) milliseconds at Day 3. Of note, 1 subject had a change in PR interval from 744 milliseconds at Baseline to 112 milliseconds at Day 3; the ECG at Baseline was not considered CS by the Investigator. A shift in 12-lead ECG overall interpretation from normal at Baseline to abnormal NCS at Day 3 was reported in 1 (12.5%) subject (Table 14.3.7.6). This was not the subject who had a PR interval of 744 milliseconds at Baseline described above.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The study KOR-PED-201 is part of the approved clinical paediatric development plan for Kapruvia. The strategy is to first confirm that the same dose as in adults with chronic-kidney disease-associated pruritus on haemodialysis (HD) of 0.5 μg/kg difelikefalin, results in a simil ar exposure in adolescents on HD.

The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 0.5 μg/kg difelikefalin was evaluated in 8 adolescents. The plasma PK-profile over 48 hr was determined from 9 plasma samples and plasma PK-parameters were determined by NCA. The PK-methodology applied in the study was adequate. The final PK-set included 7 adolescents, as one subject was excluded, as all the samples were below LLOQ. An explanation of the lack of plasma data for this subject is not available. This is acceptable, though not optimal. The key adolescent exposure PK-parameters, mean Cmax, mean AUC0-48 and mean AUCinf, were compared with previous determined adult parameters. The mean Cmax, mean AUC0-48 and mean AUCinf were very comparable with the adult parameters, 1.21 fold, 1.12 fold, 0.89 fold of adult values, respectively. Also their respective 95% confidence interval were very comparable. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the administration of a single dose of difelikefalin of 0.5 μg/kg, based on dry body weight provides comparable exposure in adolescents as in adults on HD.

Eight adolescents received a single dose of which one subject reported 2 TEAEs. The events were headache and dizziness, in line with the already known safety profile in adults. No deaths and no serious TEAEs occurred and no TEAEs led to study withdrawal.

One subject who had elevated creatinine, urea nitrogen and urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio at Screening, Baseline, and Day 3 which showed no increase over the time of dosing and thus not can be accounted to the drug.

CKD patients undergoing HD have a markedly increased CV risk, which is likely to be further impacted by CKD-aP why electrocardiograms are of special interest in this setting. A numerical decrease in mean PR interval from Baseline to Day 3, mainly driven by one subject. One change in overall classification of ECG from normal to abnormal but not clinically significant was made by the investigator for one subject. This does not point in the direction of any negative cardiac influence.

As no new safety signals were identified it is endorsed to further investigate difelikefalin 0.5 μg/kg of dry body weight in adolescents on HD with moderate-to-severe pruritus after multiple administrations, as planned as the next part of the clinical paediatric development program.

The information on PK and safety from this study should be incorporated in the SmPC.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

It has been demonstrated that the administration of a single dose of difelikefalin of 0.5 μg/kg, based on dry body weight provides comparable exposure in adolescents as in adults on HD.

The safety profile of difelikefalin 0.5 μg/kg of dry body weight, administered in adolescents as a single IV dose, was consistent with the known safety profile of difelikefalin in adults.
