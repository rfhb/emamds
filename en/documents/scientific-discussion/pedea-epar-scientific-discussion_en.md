## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Pedea. For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

On  14  February  2001,  the  European  Commission  to  Orphan  Europe,  France,  granted  orphan designation for ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus.

Pedea solution for injection is an aqueous solution of ibuprofen intended for intravenous administration for the treatment of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm  neonates  of  gestational  age  less  than  34  weeks.    Maximum  dose  level  is  10-mg/kg  body weights. The solution for injection contains 10 mg ibuprofen in a 2 ml ampoule. Ibuprofen has been marketed as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug since the 1960's.  The first published clinical use in PDA was described in a letter to the Lancet in 1995.

Ibuprofen is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, leading to reduce synthesis of prostaglandins. Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of S (+) and R (-) enantiomers. In  vivo and in  vitro studies indicate that the S (+) isomer is responsible for the clinical activity. Ibuprofen is (+/-)-2-(pisobutylphenyl)  propionic  acid  (C13H18O2)  with  a  molecular  weight  of  206.3;  and  has  the  structure shown below.

In the normal foetus the ductus arteriosus (DA) connects the main pulmonary trunk to the descending aorta, in effect it acts as a 'short circuit' to divert blood from the relatively high-pressure pulmonary circulation  of  the  non-aerated  lungs.  At  term  the  ductus  is  about  10  mm  in  diameter,  similar  to the descending aorta.  However, it differs from other vessels of the foetal circulation in that the media is composed mainly of a spiral layer of muscle fibre and the intima is thicker and develops mounds or cushions in the third trimester of pregnancy. Constriction of the musculature of the ductus is inhibited by local and circulating prostaglandins and by low oxygen tension of the blood.

At birth the lungs expand and arterial oxygen content rapidly rises, circulating prostaglandin levels fall: both these changes will tend to initiate ductal closure. In full-term infants closure begins at birth and is complete by about twelve hours. However, in premature infants circulating prostaglandin levels are  higher  than  at  term,  and  respiratory  difficulties  may  lead  to  a  state  of  hypoxia;  both  of  which contribute to the failure of the ductus to close generating a 'left to right' anatomical shunt through the patent  ductus.  The  consequence  of  this  is  relative  underperfusion  of  the  systemic  circulation  and overperfusion or the pulmonary circulation.

The pulmonary effects of PDA include an increase in pulmonary blood flow and pressure leading to pulmonary oedema and occasionally, pulmonary haemorrhage. Lung compliance is decreased and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is increased.

The effect of the cardiac shunt is to enlarge the left atrium and left ventricle. Despite an increase in left ventricle  output,  systemic  perfusion  is  reduced.    Reduced  renal  and  gut  blood  flow  impairs  renal function  and  increases  the  incidence  of  intestinal  ischaemia.    PDA  is  linked  to  intra-cranial haemorrhage and ischaemia from cerebral steal and fluctuations in cerebral blood flow.

The  frequency  of  PDA  is  inversely  related  to  gestational  age  being  higher  in  infants  of  lower gestational age. About 42% of infants under 1 kg at birth have a patent DA, falling to 21% for those

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weighing 1-1.5 kg, and 7% for those 1.5-1.75 kg.  The risk is increased by the presence of Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Prostaglandins  are  synthesised  from  arachidonic  acid  by  cyclooxygenase.  Therefore,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  that  inhibit  cyclooxygenase  are  likely  to  reduce  prostaglandin levels and promote closure of the DA.

Animal data and the observation that in human congenital heart disease, the DA could be prevented from closing by infusion of prostaglandins led to the hypothesis that it could be pharmacologically closed  by  inhibition  of  prostaglandin  synthesis.  This  was  demonstrated  and  published  in  1976  by groups working in San Diego and San Francisco using the NSAID indomethacin (NEJM, 1976).

Indomethacin has been shown to block the release of vasodilator prostaglandins at the site of the PDA. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study from 1983, Gersony et al. showed that in 460 pre-term  newborns  &lt;1.75  kg,  PDA  closure  at  48  hours  occurred  with  indomethacin  in  75-80%  of cases,  compared  to  25-30%  with  placebo.  Some  21%  of  patients  needed  a  further  dose  of indomethacin.

In  the  early  1980's,  Perlman  et  al.,  1981,  observed  an  increase  in  cerebrovascular  resistance  and hypercapnoea  while  the  DA  is  patent,  with  reversal  following  closure.    The  haemodynamic disturbance  caused  by  ductal  opening  and  closure  was  thought  to  be  a  causative  or  a  contributory factor to a feared complication of prematurity: subependymal and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). The opportunity to pharmacologically close the patent DA offered the hope of removing a source of haemodynamic instability and protecting against IVH.

The studies of Banstra et al., 1988, and Bada et al., 1989, involved well over 100 patients each and showed a beneficial effect of treatment with indomethacin.

The  study  by  Ment  et  al.,  1994,  confirmed  the  hypothesis  that  prophylactic  indomethacin  has  a protective effect against IVH. The investigators enrolled 431 neonates of 600 - 1250 g birth weight and found a statistically significant (p = 0.03) reduction; 12% of indomethacin and 18% of placebo treated infants developed IVH in the first five days of life.

However, the functional benefit of prophylactic indomethacin in terms of survival without neurological impairment has been disappointing. A recent large study (Schmidt et al., 2001) in 1202 infants with birth weight of 500 - 999 g found benefits in short-term outcomes: PDA was found in 24% of indomethacin and 50% of placebo treated infants; the corresponding rates of severe IVH were 9% and 13%. However, the rate of survival without neurological impairment at 18 months was 47% for indomethacin and 46% for placebo (p = 0.61).

A meta-analysis by Fowlie et al., 1996, showed that when used prophylactically within 24 hours of birth in pre-term infants &lt;1750 g, indomethacin reduces the incidence of PDA by about 36% (95% CI of  26-47%).    There  was  a  trend  for  a  reduction  in  mortality,  but  no  improvement  in  neurological outcome at five years.

Thus, for many years there has been concern that indomethacin causes a reduction in cerebral blood flow  and  though  this  might  have  a  protective  effect  against  haemorrhage  it  might  contribute  to ischaemic injury and contribute to long-term cerebral damage. However, recent long-term follow up (Vohr et al.,  2003)  suggests  that  later  neurological  impairment  is  associated  with  the  occurrence  of IVH in the neonatal period rather than treatment with indomethacin.

Adverse events with indomethacin include a worsening renal function, bowel ischaemia, prolongation of bleeding time, and reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygenation.

Ibuprofen was developed as an alternative to indomethacin for PDA in the hope that it might be as effective in the pharmacological management of PDA with possibly a better safety profile due to a lesser effect on the systemic blood flow (see clinical part) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Current  treatments  for  PDA  include  also  the  correction  of  anaemia  to  maintain  oxygen  carrying capacity and the optimising of fluid balance.

Pedea is indicated for treatment of a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm newborn infants less than 34 weeks of gestational age. Treatment with Pedea should only be carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit under the supervision of an experienced neonatologist.

The applicant has submitted documentation covering non-clinical and clinical study reports based on studies carried out by the applicant and bibliographic references. The relevance of the data submitted which concern a product different from Pedea has been addressed satisfactorily. Where certain studies were lacking, justifications have been given (see also non-clinical and clinical aspects).

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Pedea  is  presented  in  the  form  of  solution  for  injection  containing  5  mg/ml  of  ibuprofen.  Other ingredients are trometamol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid 25% and water for injections.

The solution is filled into 2 ml Type I glass ampoules.

## Active substance

The  active  substance  ibuprofen  complies  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  A  certificate  of  Suitability  of  the Monograph  of  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (CEP)  is  available  for  the  manufacturer  of  the  active substance.

Batch analytical data in two consecutives batches demonstrate conformance with the specifications.

A validated HPLC method is used to assess the content and purity of ibuprofen. Hence, the quality of ibuprofen can be properly controlled and assured using the proposed testing methods and specifications.

## Stability of the active substance

No stability data are provided on the grounds that the CEP defines a re-test period for the substance when stored in fibre drums.

## Other ingredients

With the exception of hydrochloric acid, all excipients comply with the requirements of relevant Ph. Eur.  monographs.  Hydrochloric  Acid  25%  is  tested  according  to  the  current  monograph  of  the Ph. Helv.  Appropriate  certificates  of  analysis  are  presented  for  each  excipient,  showing  that  the compendial requirements were met. All the excipients are commonly used in parenteral formulations.

None of the materials are stated to be of animal origin, therefore there is no TSE risk.

The  solution  is  filled  into  2  ml  colourless  OPC  (One-Point-Cut)  Type  I  glass  ampoules  with  blue point. The ampoules meet the standard of quality of glass with hydrolytic resistance (Ph. Eur).

## Product development and finished product

The  aim  of  the  development  was  an  aqueous  ibuprofen  solution  which  is  suitable  for  intravenous injection and which remains stable over a period of time as long as possible.

The basic idea was to make the composition as simple as possible and with well-known excipients. Due to the poor solubility of ibuprofen in water in the acidic pH-range, the solution was adjusted to achieve  a  good  solubility  using  sodium  hydroxide  and  hydrochloric  acid  25%.  The  solubility  was additionally improved by the addition of a small amount of trometamol. Finally, sodium chloride is added to adjust the tonicity of the solution and to avoid irritation.

The medicinal product is prepared under very clean conditions, including sterile filtration of the bulk solution and filling of the solution in previously sterilised ampoules; finally the ampoules are sterilised in a steam autoclave (121°C for 20 minutes). Based on the microbiological quality requirements of the ingredients and the demonstrated performance of the filling process and the final sterilisation, it can be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concluded that the manufacturing method is capable of producing a sterile and pyrogen free finished product.

Considering the simple nature  of the formulation, the  detailed  account  given  for  the  manufacturing process,  the  finished  product  can  be  properly  controlled  using  the  proposed  testing  methods  and specifications.

## Product Specification

The product specifications include tests by validated methods for appearance, ibuprofen identification (HPLC, TLC) and assay (HPLC, 10.0 mg ± 5%, 9.50 mg to 10.50 mg), purity (HPLC), clarity and opalescent,  visible  and  invisible  particle,  coloration,  density,  pH,  extractable  volume,  osmolality, sterility and endotoxins.

Degradation products are controlled and their limits are justified by reference to stability studies and toxicology studies.

The tests and limits of the specifications for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality of the finished product for their intended purpose.

Batch analysis data on three batches confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release.

## Stability of the Product

The shelf life specification is the same as the release specification.

The stability testing on ibuprofen ampoules has been carried out on three production scale batches, these batches have been stored under the following different conditions; in the pack as intended for marketing:  refrigerator  for  12  months  (2-6°C,  no  humidity  controls),  25°C/60%  RH  and  31°C/70% RH for 60 months (48 month results are available) and, 41°C/drying cabinet for 9 months instead of the recommended 40°C/75% RH. Finally, batches were also stored at 21°C/50% RH for 36 months. Even though, these conditions are not standard, in view of the well-known stability characteristics of this established substance, they may be accepted.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## GLP

Four  volumes  of  data  have  been  submitted  the  great  majority  of  which  is  bibliographic.  The  two studies  sponsored  by  the  applicant  specifically  in  support  of  this  procedure:  an  acute  i.v.  Toxicity study in the weaned and adult rat; and a local tolerance study; were both conducted in accordance with GLP.

## Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro and in vivo studies

The applicant reviewed the main relevant published pharmacological studies conducted in animals in the proposed indication of PDA. The results of the studies were considered as valid and acceptable. In addition,  there  was  no  justification  to  support  the  primary  pharmacological  activity  of  ibuprofen  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preclinical in vivo or ex vivo animal models of PDA since the potential of ibuprofen to close the DA had already been shown at the time when the development of Pedea was started.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) has an intrinsic tone and patency is an active state that is maintained by prostaglandins, mainly PGE2 which is the most potent DA relaxing agent known (Coceani et al., 1994, Smith et al., 1994). Although it is ~1000 times less potent than PGE2, the DA also relaxes in response to  high  concentrations  of  PGI2 and  there  is  functional  evidence  to  suggest  a  dilator  role  for  PGI2. Although native prostaglandins are all agonists at other types of prostaglandin receptors, albeit at least an  order  of  magnitude  less  potent,  PGI2  is  not  effecting  relaxation  via  the  PGE2  receptor.  The presence of PGI2 receptors in the DA has been demonstrated and, as in other blood vessels, PGI2 is the  main  arachidonic  acid  product  in  the  DA;  approximately  10  times  as  much  PGI2  as  PGE2  is synthesised (Coceani et al., 1980). It appears therefore that PGI2 also plays a physiological role in the maintenance of the patency of the DA.

Studies in  genetically  engineered  cyclooxygenase-deficient mice  suggest  that patency  can  be maintained in the foetus by maternally synthesised prostaglandins (Loftin et al., 2001).

Further, administration of various NSAIDs in late pregnancy is known to cause premature closure of the  DA in  many species, including humans (Van den Veyver et al., 1993). Studies in pregnant rats have demonstrated dose-related constriction of the DA as a general property of acidic NSAIDs, with indomethacin  and  ibuprofen  being  amongst  the  most  potent  (Momma  et  al.,  1983,  Momma  et  al., 1984, Momma et al., 1990). Comparing clinical doses, ibuprofen was more potent than indomethacin, although the effect of indomethacin was more prolonged, possibly because its plasma half-life in the rat is longer than that of ibuprofen (Adams et al., 1969).

Coceani et al.,  1979,  first  studied  the  Pharmacology  specific  to  the  proposed  indication  in  animals. Although indomethacin did not induce closure of the DA in pre-term rat foetuses, there appear to be species differences (Momma et al., 1983, Sharpe et al., 1974). In lambs, the prostaglandin mechanism responsible  for  maintenance  of  DA  patency  becomes  functional  earlier  in  gestation;  ibuprofen  has been shown to contract foetal lamb DA in vitro over the last trimester of gestation and constriction of foetal DA by ibuprofen was reported to be stronger in tissue from pre-term than in that from full-term foetuses (Coceani et al., 1979, Friedman et al., 1976, Heyman et al., 1976). Ibuprofen was shown to close  the  DA  in  lambs  (Coceani  et  al.,  1979)  and  not  to  affect  basal  CBF,  cerebral  metabolic  rate, intestinal or renal hemodynamics in animal models, in contrast to indomethacin.

As  NSAIDs  given  during  human  pregnancy  cause  premature  closure  of  the  DA,  the  mechanism appears to be functional in the human pre-term infant (Malcolm et al., 1993).

The PGE2 receptor exists as four distinct subtypes denoted EP 1 to EP 4 (Coleman et al., 1994). The receptor subtypes functioning in the DA have been investigated in a number of animal species but it is not clear whether inter-species differences exist (Segi et al., 1998).

A study in foetal rabbit tissue suggests that dilation of the DA is mediated via the EP 4 receptor; the inability of indomethacin to effect closure of the DA in EP 4 deficient mice is supports this, but as these  mice  survive  in  utero  an  alternative  mechanism  must  also  exist,  possibly  involving  other subtypes (or perhaps the PGI2 receptor) (Nguyen et al. 1997, Segi et al., 1998). Agonists for EP I and EP 3 receptors also contract foetal rabbit DA in vitro but foetal piglet DA has been shown to express EP receptors 2, 3 and 4 in equivalent density, but no EP 1 receptor (Bhattacharya et al., 1999, Smith et al., 1995).

In the newborn piglet the density of the EP 2 receptors is maintained but there is a complete loss of the EP3 and EP 4 receptors resulting in a reduction of total PGE2 binding capacity, which must contribute to  the  reduced  responsiveness  of  the  DA  to  prostaglandins  after  birth  even  if  other  factors  are  also involved. It also suggests that in the newborn piglet dilation of the DA by prostaglandins is mediated via the EP 2 receptor (Bhattacharya et al., 1999).

After birth the closure of the DA occurs in two steps; the first step is a functional closure, caused by constriction of the medial muscle layer and usually occurs in the first few hours after birth, this is then followed by anatomical closure involving infolding of the epithelium and disruption of the subintimal layers, which is usually completed by the second week of life. The process of closure of the DA after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

birth  is  similar  in  all  mammalian  species,  although  there  are  differences  in  closure  rate  and morphology (Clyman et al., 1983, Clyman et al., 1999, Hörnblad et al., 1967).

During the first step, the DA becomes less responsive to oxygen and PGE2; the changes that affect this must include the down-regulation of EP receptors. Ischaemia of the medial muscle (resulting from reduced blood flow) appears to be the stimulus for the second step (Bhattacharya et al., 1999, Clyman et al., 1983, Clyman et al., 1999).

The  mechanism  underlying  the  closure  of  the  DA  at  birth  is  complex  and  is  probably  not  yet completely elucidated (Coceani et al., 1980). The sudden increase in blood oxygen tension produced by the first breath and the drop in circulating prostaglandin levels that occurs after parturition have long been considered to be implicated (Hammerman et al., 2001).

Maintenance  of  the  ischaemic  state  is  required  for  completion  of  anatomical  remodelling  and  the longer  the  DA  remains  constricted  the  less  it  is  able  to  respond  to  the  dilation  stimulus  of prostaglandins.  Therefore,  when  the  DA  remains  patent  in  the  newborn,  constriction  by  any  means followed by maintenance of the ischaemic state should allow anatomical remodelling.

It  has  recently  been  shown  that,  despite  the  fact  that  in  the  newborn  COX  2  and  not  COX  1  is expressed  in  the  DA,  it  is  circulating  prostaglandin  produced  systemically  by  COX  I  and  not  local prostaglandin synthesised by COX 2 that maintains the patency of the DA (Guerguerian et al., 1998). Indomethacin  has  been  shown  to  close  the  DA  in  the  newborn  piglet  and  as  a  selective  COX  1 inhibitor  (but  not  a  selective  COX  2  inhibitor)  was  also  shown  to  effect  closure,  it  appears  that constriction  of  the  DA  is  purely  prostaglandin-mediated  and  the  vasoconstrictive  properties  of indomethacin are making no contribution. Therefore, although there has been no actual demonstration in newborn animals that ibuprofen will constrict the DA, it can also be expected to be effective. The extended plasma half-life in the human neonate will also contribute to the maintenance of constriction that is required for anatomical remodelling to take place.

## Secondary pharmacodynamics

The effects resulting from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis after administration of NSAIDs have been well characterised and the applicant has provided a review of the effects of ibuprofen on different organs  and  systems  and  clarified  its  effects  on  cerebral  and  renal  blood  flow  and  its  action  on  the pulmonary circulation

The biological activities of the prostanoids (the autocoids generated via the cyclooxygenase pathway) are  extremely  diverse.  They  produce  their  effects  by  acting  on  specific  receptors  and  the  specific biological activity results from local generation of the specific prostanoids and the tissue distribution of  the  various  types  of  receptors  (Coleman  et  al.,  1994).  Inhibition  of  prostaglandin  synthesis  may therefore interfere with these processes and result in unwanted side effects.

The adverse  effects  resulting  from  inhibition  of  prostaglandin  synthesis  after  oral  administration  of NSAIDs are well known. The most common, the occurrence of gastro-intestinal bleeding, is usually  a  consequence  of  long-term  administration;  the  incidence  in  humans  is  much  lower  for ibuprofen than for any other NSAID (Langman et al., 1994, Henry et al., 1996, Henry et al., 1999). Potential for renal toxicity is inherent in all NSAIDs as a result of inhibition of the synthesis of PGE2 and PGI2 which are involved in the maintenance of renal blood dynamics, but usually toxicity only occurs when renal perfusion is impaired (Whelton et al., 1991). The risk for adverse effects in children aged ~8 months has been shown to be low after oral administration of ibuprofen (Lesko et al., 1995).

Although ibuprofen inhibits thromboxane (TxA2) biosynthesis and causes a dose-related inhibition of ex  vivo aggregation  of  rat  platelets  after  oral  administration,  it  has  little  anti-coagulative  activity (Evans  et  al.,  1991,  Rainsford  et  al.,  1999).  Its  anti-thrombotic  effect in  vivo is  weak,  after  i.p. administration in rabbits it was about 450 times less effective than Indomethacin (DiPasquale et al., 1997, Royer et al., 1985). It is also a weak inhibitor of platelet aggregation in man.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prostaglandins  are  involved  in  the  physiological  regulation  of  vascular  tone,  usually  exerting  a vasodilatory effect. However, in adult animals the effects of intravenous administration of ibuprofen on blood-flow are limited. Administered intravenously to adult baboons, ibuprofen 50 mg/kg (either as four  bolus  doses  of  12.5  mg/kg  at  6  hourly  intervals  or  as  a  continuous  infusion  over  24  hours) produced  only  mild  or  insignificant  changes  in  haemodynamic  parameters  (mean  arterial  pressure, central venous pressure and heart rate) (Rao et al., 1994).

In adult mongrel dogs, however, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg i.v, increased aortic blood pressure by 20% and caused  a  slight,  although  significant  reduction  of  the  renal  blood  flow  (Feigen  et  al.,  1981).  The reference  drug  indomethacin,  2.5  mg/kg,  produced  a  similar  effect  on  aortic  and  renal  flow  but, whereas  this  dose  of  ibuprofen  had  no  significant  effect  on  mesenteric  blood  flow,  indomethacin rapidly  reduced  mesenteric  blood  flow  by  50%.  Both  drugs  similarly  attenuated  the  responses  to arachidonic acid (i.e. inhibited prostaglandin synthesis) at the doses used, but, unlike the effects on renal vascular resistance, the ability of indomethacin to elicit mesenteric vasoconstriction was shown to be independent of its inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.

In the premature human newborn, in the presence of a PDA, there is a redistribution of systemic blood flow,  which  can  lead  to  impaired  perfusion  of  some  organ  systems,  with  the  gastrointestinal  tract, kidneys and brain being especially vulnerable (Hammerman et al., 2001). The effects of intravenous ibuprofen on regional blood flow to these organs have been investigated in newborn animals.

Ibuprofen, 0.02 and 0.2 mg/kg i.v. produced a dose-related increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) with consequent decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in newborn rabbits  (Chamaa et al.,  2000).  Urinary  volume,  unaffected  at  the  lowest  dose, was  decreased  at  0.2 mg/kg. A ten-fold increase in dose to 2.0 mg/kg had little further effect.

The investigators concluded that the renal effects of ibuprofen in the newborn rabbit are at least as great  as  those  of  indomethacin,  but  no  reference  group  was  included  in  this  study  and  the  data  for indomethacin, quoted from an earlier study, are for a single dose, 2.0 mg/kg only.

Although the values for changes in RVR, RBF, GFR and urinary volume are comparable with those at the  same  dose  of  ibuprofen,  there  is  no  data  for  lower  doses  of  indomethacin  and  consequently  no information on the dose at which maximal response is achieved.

In a study in newborn piglets the doses of ibuprofen and indomethacin effective in closure of PDA in the  human premature infant were compared directly (Speziale et al., 1999). A much higher dose of ibuprofen (20 mg/kg i.v.) than in the previous study increased vascular resistance in the renal cortex and medulla (by 40 and 50 % respectively) at 90 and 120 minutes after administration. After a dose of indomethacin of 0.3 mg/kg, (much lower than that quoted in the previous study) RVR increased to a greater  extent  (66  and  70  %  respectively)  at  40  minutes  after  injection  and  the  blood  flow  was significantly decreased. Consequently, the potential for ibuprofen to affect renal blood flow appears to be no greater than that of indomethacin.

In the same study, ibuprofen showed no effect on gastrointestinal blood-flow in the newborn piglet, whereas  indomethacin  rapidly  almost  doubled  vascular  resistance  in  duodenum/jejunum,  ileum  and colon (Speziale et al., 1999).

Ibuprofen  was  shown  in  the  newborn  piglet  not  to  affect  cerebral  vascular  resistance  or  have  any significant  effects  on  total  or  regional  cerebral  blood  flow  either  at  a  dose  comparable  to  that  used clinically for closure of the DA (20 mg/kg i.v.) or at a higher dose (30 mg/kg) at which prostaglandin synthesis was  markedly  decreased  (Pellicer  et  al.,  1999,  Speziale et al.,  1999). In contrast, indomethacin exerted a significant vasoconstrictive effect in the brain even at a dose of 3 mg/kg that did  not  affect  cerebral  prostaglandin  synthesis  with  vascular  resistance  being  doubled  at  maximal response  to  0.3  mg/kg,  the  dose  used  for  closure  of  the  DA  (Chemtob  et  al.,  1991).  Consequently, unlike indomethacin, ibuprofen would not be expected to exacerbate the effects of PDA on cerebral blood flow.

Although prostanoids do not play a critical role in the regulation of basal CBF in the newborn, they do however playa role in setting the blood pressure limits within which autoregulation of cerebral blood flow  can  be  maintained  in  the  newborn  (Chemtob  et  al.,  1990,  Chemtob  et  al.,  1991).  In  newborn piglets,  although  global  and  regional  blood  flow  was  maintained  at  a  constant  proportion  of  mean

blood  flow  over  a  blood  pressure  range  of  50-90  mm  Hg  in  the  control  group,  it  varied  markedly outside these limits. However, in a group treated with ibuprofen (30 mg/kg i.v.) the blood pressure range over which cerebral blood flow did not vary significantly was extended to 37-117 mm Hg. In addition, at the lowest blood pressure investigated (30 mm Hg), the decrease in cerebral blood flow was significantly less in the ibuprofen-treated group than in the control group (30% compared to 75%, p&lt;0.001). Consequently, ibuprofen not only has no deleterious effect on cerebral blood flow even in the newborn, but where blood flow is reduced it may assist in its maintenance.

Indomethacin has been reported to inhibit physiological carbon dioxide-induced cerebral vasodilation during normoxic hypocarbia (Pellicer et al., 1999). Prostaglandins do not appear to be involved in the mechanism and ibuprofen (30 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect in newborn piglets under these conditions. Under  artificial  ventilation,  frequently  a  necessity  in  premature  human  infants,  cardiac  output  is decreased  (Malcolm  et  al.,  1993).  When  cardiac  output  falls  the  decrease  in  blood  flow  is  not distributed equally amongst the different vascular beds; blood flow to the brain is maintained with that to  the  kidney  and  gut  being  compromised. In artificially ventilated, newborn piglets, cardiac output decreased with increasing airways pressure. Blood flow to  colon, ileum  and  kidney decreased with increasing pressure but cerebral flow was maintained. As prostaglandin levels were unaffected they do not appear to be involved in the underlying mechanism and intravenous, administration of ibuprofen, 40 mg/kg, did not influence the effects of artificially ventilation on regional blood flow; in contrast indomethacin, 0.3 mg/kg, further reduced blood flow to the ileum and brain.

In  the  lung  the  low  vascular  tone  of  both  arterial  and  vascular  vessels  characteristic  of  the  adult pulmonary circulation is maintained by basal production of vasodilatory prostaglandins, mainly PGI2 and the adult pulmonary circulation shows little or no response to physiological or pharmacological stimulation (Abman et al., 1989).

The sudden and dramatic decrease in PVR that occurs at birth is essential for normal transition from foetal to neonatal circulation, with the pulmonary circulation being required to dilate to accommodate an eight- to ten-fold increase in blood flow. Several physiological stimuli contribute to the fall in PVR, amongst  them,  rhythmic  distension  of  the  lung  and  increased  oxygen  tension  as  well  as  the haemodynamic  stress  resulting  from  constriction  of  the  DA.  The  final  mediator  of  stress-induced vasodilation is nitric oxide (NO), which appears to play a greater part in the regulation of PVR in the perinatal pulmonary circulation than PGI2 and it has been shown that PGI2 exert its effects mainly via release of NO (Storme et al., 1999).

It is not therefore surprising that in the term neonatal lamb, although pulmonary vasodilation induced by rhythmic distension without oxygenation was inhibited in the presence of a NSAID, there was no effect  on  oxygen-induced  pulmonary  vasodilation  which  is  mediated  by  direct  activation  of  nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by oxygen (Velvis et al., 1991, Zenge et al., 2001). In the full term neonatal lamb,  although  dose  related  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  was  observed  after  acute  administration  of indomethacin the response was no longer present after repeated dosing, suggesting that the neonatal lung  adapts  to  chronic  inhibition  of  prostaglandin  synthesis  by  the  development  of  NO-based mechanisms and prostaglandins are not essential for maintenance of pulmonary vascular tone (Lock et al., 1980).

If  the  oxygen stimulated mechanism for activation of NO synthesis has not yet developed in a very premature baby inhibition of rhythmic distension-induced vasodilation by administration of an NSAID very soon after birth could allow a myogenic response and therefore pulmonary vasoconstriction. If the DA and/or foramen ovale is still patent (as in the cases in the clinical trial) an increase in PVR would  re-establish  the  foetal  pattern  of  circulation,  reducing  pulmonary  blood  flow,  decreasing oxygenation, which in its turn causes metabolic acidosis and hypoxia. As the vasodilatory response to hypoxia is prostaglandin mediated this will also be suppressed (Leeman et al., 1999).

Free  radicals  have  been  implicated  in  the  development  of  injury  to  the  immature  retina.  Asphyxia increases the levels of both free radicals and prostaglandins and using newborn piglets, a species with retinal characteristics similar to those of the human, ibuprofen has been used to demonstrate that the cyclooxygenase pathway is probably the source of free radicals after asphyxia. Administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor may therefore protect the retina in the premature newborn when blood flow

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is  compromised.  Indomethacin  may  not  afford  the  same  overall  advantage  as  it  has  been  shown  to impair  retinal  haemodynamics  in  the  newborn  piglet  by  a  mechanism  unrelated  to  inhibition  of prostaglandin synthesis whereas ibuprofen enhances retinal and choroidal blood flow autoregulation in newborn piglets (Chemtob et al., 1991, Parys-Van Ginderdeuren et al., 1992).

Further, ibuprofen appears to exert a cytoprotective effect on the intestinal mucosa (Grosfeld et al., 1983).  In  an  experimental  model  of  bowel  ischemia  in  rats,  animals  treated  with  ibuprofen  had significantly  lower  incidence  of  intestinal  necrosis  (Grosfeld  et  al.,  1983).  It  is  suggested  that  the protective  effect  of  ibuprofen  results  from  inhibition  of  synthesis  of  thromboxane,  which  is  a vasoconstrictor.

Like all the carboxylic acid NSAIDS, ibuprofen binds to serum albumin at the same site as bilirubin (Cooper-Peel et al., 1996). In an in vitro study using infant blood serum ibuprofen, at a concentration close to that seen in clinical use for closure of the DA (750 µmol/l, i.e. 154.7 µg/ml), increased the free bilirubin fraction fourfold at a bilirubin to albumin molar ratio (B:A) of 1:2. No absolute values for free bilirubin concentration are quoted in the publication and it is not clear whether the free bilirubin concentration reaches a level at which a premature infant would be at risk for bilirubin encephalopathy. A later study (Ma et al., 2002) using a different method with albumin solutions at varying concentrations, reports that significant displacement does not occur until the B:A ratio reaches 2:1  (no  effect  at  1.5:1)  and  at  an  ibuprofen  concentration  of  285  µg/ml  (no  effect  at  200  µg/ml compared to a clinical level of 180 µg/ml).

Some NSAlDs appear to modulate signal transduction pathways involved in immune cell maturation and apoptosis and consequently have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects independent of cyclooxygenase  and  prostaglandin  synthesis  inhibition  (Tegeder  et  al.,  2001).  These  effects  vary between the individual drugs. The properties which ibuprofen does not share with indomethacin are inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, interference with the MAP kinase cascade at two points, stimulation  of  a  shock  factor  release  and  expression  of  a  nuclear  receptor.  The in  vitro IC50 concentrations  required  are  at  least  100-fold  those  effective  in  inhibition  of  COX  enzymes.  These properties are unlikely to be relevant in short-term administration.

## Safety pharmacology

After  many  years  of  use,  the  risks  for  adverse  effects  on  major  physiological  systems  after  oral administration  of  ibuprofen  are  well  characterised  and  are  always  related  to  the  primary  effect  of inhibition of prostaglandin  synthesis. The  effects of intravenously  administered  ibuprofen  on physiological systems, which may be compromised in the presence of a PDA, have been investigated in  newborn animals (see  secondary pharmacodynamics). Conventional safety pharmacology studies would add nothing to the information already available for ibuprofen.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics  and  ADME  characteristics  were  studied  in  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs  (Adams  et  al., 1969,  Adams  et  al.,  1970,  Mills  et  al.,  1973).  Adams  et  al.,  1969,  detailed  pharmacokinetics  of ibuprofen  after  a  single  dose,  pharmacokinetics  of  ibuprofen  after  repeated  administration  and distribution in the different tissues of rats, rabbits and dogs. Mills et al., 1973, studied the metabolism and excretion of ibuprofen in rats, baboons and dogs.

As the pattern of effects reported in these species is similar, the results of the studies can be considered as  valid  and  acceptable.  In  addition,  it  was  considered  unethical  and  unnecessary  to  undertake extensive animal studies to obtain information on what was already known for humans.

Ibuprofen has a short plasma half-life in both animals and adult humans. It is cleared by oxidative metabolism and is mainly excreted in urine as conjugates of its metabolites. All metabolites found in man are present in the animal species used for toxicity studies and all are pharmacologically inactive. Ibuprofen is a racemic compound; its activity resides in the S-isomer, the R-isomer is inactive. Like many propionic acid derivatives, it undergoes metabolic inversion. This is uni-directional in all species examined, including man, with the inactive R-isomer being converted to the active S form.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  human  premature neonate, the plasma half-life of ibuprofen after i.v. administration is 30hrs compared with 2hrs after oral administration in the adult, a value which is achieved in infants by about 6  months  of  age  (Aranda  et  al.,  1997,  Kelley  et  al.,  1992).  Although  immature  renal  function  may contribute to the slow elimination, it is likely that limited capacity for metabolism is the main cause of the  prolonged  plasma  half-life.  Ibuprofen  is  metabolised  by  oxidation  and  carboxylation  of  the isobutyl side chain followed by conjugation of the metabolites. The activity of the cytochrome P450 complex and NADPH cytochrome c reductase are very much lower in the newborn than in adults and glucuronidation  capacity  is  greatly  reduced  (Warner  et  al.,  1986).  Presumably  the  deficit  is  even greater  in  the  premature  neonate.  It  has  also  been  reported  that  whilst  clearance  and  volume  of distribution in infants (6-18 months) are similar to adults, plasma concentrations of the R-isomer after administration of the racemate are considerably higher than those of the S-isomer (Rey et al., 1994). This suggests that stereo inversion capacity may also be reduced in infants. This is not unlikely as the mechanism of stereo-inversion involves formation of the R-ibuprofen-CoA complex and the activity of the enzymes required may also be deficient in the human neonate. It is possible that this could both enhance efficacy by providing a prolonged release of the pharmacologically active S-isomer and also limit potential toxicity.

## Drug interactions

Most clinically significant drug interactions result from the ability of NSAIDs  to inhibit cyclooxygenase, thereby reducing prostaglandin biosynthesis. Some NSAID drug interactions result from  the  fact  that  NSAIDs  are  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  and  thus  may  compete  with  other drugs for binding sites. Data referring to interactions studies conducted in animals with ibuprofen are very sparse. However, this point is further addressed in the clinical part and taking into account the specificity  of  the  target  population,  the  applicant  considers  that  animal  findings  would  not  better contribute to the knowledge of potential interactions of ibuprofen with concomitant drugs commonly used in neonates suffering from PDA.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity and Repeat dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs in 1969 (Adams et al., 1969), but taking  into  consideration  the  new  route  of  administration  and  the  target  population,  the  applicant conducted an acute toxicity study with Pedea in the weaned and the adult rats by the intravenous route.

The same authors (Adams et al., 1969) studied repeated dose toxicity - long-term during 26 weeks in rats and dogs. It was considered that the published data available in rats and in dogs together with the results of the acute toxicity give sufficient information to assess toxicity of ibuprofen.

In addition, as in the local tolerance study no evidence of organ related toxicity was seen at necropsy after 5 daily injections, the applicant considered that additional repeat-dose studies were not deemed necessary.

Although  the  intravenous  route  has  undertaken  no  repeated  dose  studies,  such  studies  could  add nothing to the information already available for ibuprofen. Either the dose would be sufficiently high to  be  lethal  or,  because  ibuprofen  is  secreted  into  the  stomach,  there  would  be  evidence  of gastrointestinal  irritation  as  seen  after  administration  by  other  parenteral  routes.  Possibly,  renal toxicity  might  be  evident  after  repeated  i.  v.  administration,  but  this  is  an  established  hazard.  No evidence of  organ related  toxicity  was  seen  at  necropsy  after  five  daily  injections  of  the  maximum therapeutic  dose.  The  actual  risks  arising  from  prolonged  inhibition  of  prostaglandin  synthesis  as  a result  of  the  prolonged  retention  of  ibuprofen  in  the  premature  neonate  can  only  be  assessed  in  the clinic.

In  the  acute  toxicity  study  undertaken  in  weaned  and  adult  rats,  the  symptoms  observed,  after intravenous administration (i.e. CNS  depression) were consistent with those seen after oral administration, but at higher doses were sufficiently extensive to cause death. All deaths were rapid and there was a clear demarcation between lethal and non-lethal doses. The cause of death was CNS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

depression;  as  ibuprofen  readily  penetrates  the  brain  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  acute  intravenous toxicity of the formulation was not significantly different in weanling and adult rats. Although it is not practical  to  ascertain  whether  there  is  a  clear  difference  in  sensitivity  in  premature  animals,  the potential hazard has been established.

The maximum non-lethal dose administered was 265 mg/kg (Davies et al., 1993). The blood volume of a rat has been reported to be 5-7% of the body weight, taking a mid value of 6%, and a haematocrit of  46  (ibid),  total  plasma  volume  would  be  32.4  ml/kg,  therefore  the  'instantaneous'  plasma concentration  on  administration  of  this  dose  would  be  8.2  mg/ml,  (i.e.  8200mg/l).  Making  a comparable  calculation  for  a  human  neonate,  plasma  volume  41.5  ml/kg,  injection  of  the  maximal dose  of  20mg/kg  would  give  an  instantaneous  concentration  of  0.5mg/ml  (500mg/l)  (Aranda  et  al., 1997, Low et al., 1963).

In the premature human neonate binding to plasma albumin is lower than in the adult and similar to that in the rat (95%); levels of free drug will therefore be comparable and about one-sixteenth of the maximal  value  which  could  have  been  achieved  in  the  rat  after  a  dose  at  which  transient  CNS depression was observed. At the plasma concentrations of 180mg/l reported effective in therapeutic use the safety factor is ~45 (Aranda et al., 1997, Van Overmeire et al., 1999).

## Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo

Mutagenic potential was investigated in Europe, India and in the USA. Oldham and al., 1986, tested ibuprofen for mutagenic activity in the Ames test using five strains of S. typhimurium and activation by liver microsomes from three different species. No mutagenic activity was observed.

Ibuprofen, like three other NSAIDs, also gave negative results in a multi gene assay using B. subtilis, which showed a positive effect for clofibrate (Van Overmeire et al., 1999). In 1997, an Indian team (Philipose et al., 1997) confirmed lack of mutagenic potential in an Ames test. In the same paper these authors  concluded  that  ibuprofen  was  \"weakly  mutagenic\"  in  an in  vivo sister  chromatid  exchange (SCE) study using bone marrow cells (Philipose et al., 1997). This conclusion was based on a very slight  dose-related  trend  to  increase  in  SCE/cell  which  was  significantly  different  from  control (p&lt;0.01) at the mid and high dose levels, although the value did not reach double the control level even at the high dose (Philipose et al., 1997). However, where such a three-point monotonic response occurs without inducing doubling of the SCE incidence, the highest dose increase is required to be at the significance level of p&lt;0.001 for the response to be considered positive (Tucker et al., 1993). The results reported in this study do not fulfil this criterion.

No  evidence  for  an  effect  on  SCE  has  been  found  in  clinical  use.  There  was  no  increase  in  the incidence of SCE after clinical use of NSAIDs in two studies that included ibuprofen (Kullich et al., 1986, Ozkul et al., 1996). Although the number of patients was not high in either study there has also been  a  negative  report  from  a  study  with  NSAIDs  in  which  ibuprofen  was  not  included,  by investigators who have been able to pick up a positive response in patients on anti-convulsive therapy using the same methods in a similar size population (Sardas et al., 1991, Sardas et al., 1994).

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies were performed in the EU in the 1960s in mice and rats (Adams et al., 1970). Although the carcinogenicity study carried out during the original development of ibuprofen cannot be considered adequate by current standards, no positive response was evident. Although prostaglandins are involved in cell proliferation, neoplasia and the immune response, there has been no indication  from  the  carcinogenicity  studies  carried  out  to  current  standards  with  newer  NSAIDs that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis per se has any carcinogenic potential.

Frequent use of NSAIDs has in fact been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of colorectal cancer and  although  no  negative  correlations  with  other  types  of  malignancy  were  found  in  this  large epidemiological study, it is noteworthy that no positive correlations emerged (Rosenberg et al., 1991). NSAIDs  inhibit  tumorigenesis  in  the  lung  induced  in  animals  by  the  N-nitrosamine  L8  NNK  (4-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(methylnitrosamino]-1-(3-pyridyl]-1-butanone) found in tobacco smoke. The mechanism appears to be related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis rather than direct inhibition of NNK- LID induced lipid peroxidation  or  oxidative  DNA  damage.  It  has  also  been  suggested  that  inhibition  of  prostaglandin synthesis  may  suppress  tumour  incidence  by  enhancing  apoptosis  in  carcinogen-initiated  rat  colon cells (Nicholson et al., 1998).

NSAIDs have also been reported to be cytotoxic in vitro to a wide range of tumour types, including breast and renal cancer cells, whilst being less toxic to normal non-malignant cell lines.

During evaluation of a clinical trial application a query was made regarding the potential mutagenicity of metabolites other than those normally found in the adult, which might be present in the premature neonate (Brocks et al., 1999). The molecular structure of ibuprofen is relatively simple; it possesses no group such as an ester or an amide that could be readily hydrolysed and it is eliminated by oxidative metabolism and conjugation. No hydroxylation of the phenyl ring or of the propionic acid group has ever been detected. The capacity of the neonate to carry out the metabolic processes is likely to be reduced,  resulting  in  a  prolonged  plasma  half-life,  but  it  seems  very  unlikely  that  the  premature neonate would have the capacity to metabolise ibuprofen by routes not seen in the adult. Before the mutagenic potential of abnormal metabolites could be investigated their existence and structure would have to be established.

Considering the above data already available and the extensive use of ibuprofen in other indications for  many  years,  it  was  considered  that  the  study  of  the  genotoxic  and  carcinogenic  potential  of ibuprofen is sufficiently documented in the literature.

## Reproductive and developmental studies

Reproduction studies with ibuprofen were performed in rats and rabbits (Adams et al., 1969).

Considering that Pedea will be exclusively administered to premature neonates, the target population is  not  at  risk  regarding  pregnancy.  It  is  therefore  sufficiently  justified  not  to  extensively  assess possible embryotoxic and/or perinatal toxicities of ibuprofen in such a population.

However,  the  following  supportive  data  were  retrieved  from  the  literature  regarding 'Fertility  and General Reproductive performance':

Ibuprofen, 20 mg/kg/day administered in the diet to male and female rats for 60 days prior to mating had no adverse effect on fertility or reproductive function. When administered from day 1 of gestation to  caesarean section on day 20 there may have been some early total litter losses at a dose of 180mg/kg/day i.g. (NOEL 60 mg/kg/day).

In the rabbit, the ratio of implants to corpora lutea was reduced in comparison to controls at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day orally given over days 1 - 29 of gestation (NOEL 20 mg/kg/day). This effect is seen with  many  Non-Steroidal  Anti-Inflammatory  Drugs  (NSAIDs)  as  prostaglandins  are  involved  in implantation.

External, visceral and skeletal malformations and skeletal variations were comparable to controls in litters from rats given ibuprofen over days 1-20 of gestation at dose levels up to 180 mg/kg/day, a dose at which growth rate was reduced (NOEL 60 mg/kg/day, intestinal lesions present from 20 mg/kg/day).

Malformations  showed  no  relationship  to  dose  in  rabbits  given  ibuprofen  at  dose  levels  up  to  60mg/kg/day  i.g.  Post-implantation  loss  and  foetal  weight  and  viability  were  comparable  to  controls. Weight gain was reduced from 20 mg/kg/day and gastric lesions were present from 7.5 mg/kg/day.

In rats given ibuprofen at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day from day 1of gestation to parturition, litter size, viability indices at birth and weaning and weight at weaning were comparable in treated and control animals.  The  original  studies  (Adams  et  al.,  1969)  do  not  record  any  observations  of  an  effect  on parturition.

## Local tolerance

The  applicant  to  assess  the  effects  of  daily  intravenous  administration  of  Pedea  for  5  days  has performed a local tolerance study in rabbits. The intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous routes were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

investigated. This study showed that the formulation is well tolerated; local effects were related to the injection  rather  than  the  solutions  (either  preparation  or  vehicle)  administered.  There  was  no difference between the test article and the two control groups (vehicle and saline) in terms of local tolerance.    Although  the  difference  did  not  reach  significance,  the  anti-inflammatory  effect  of ibuprofen was apparent at the injection site after i.v. administration, with the mechanical trauma of the injection (haematoma and erythema) being observed after the first administration of saline or vehicle but  not  until  after  the  fifth  injection  of  the  formulation.  There  was  no  evidence  of  organ  related toxicity at necropsy after 5 daily injections.

## Other toxicity studies

## Excipients and impurities

The formulation contains trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol, also referred to as TRIS or THAM, 7.56 mg/2 ml, a concentration of 0.03 M. The quantity administered in a single dose will be 7.56 mg/kg and the maximum total dose of trometamol will be 15.12 mg/kg. On  injection,  it  distributes  to  the  extracellular  space  and  is  rapidly  excreted  via  the  kidney  in  its protonated form by glomerular filtration. Trace amounts are metabolised by oxidation in hepatocytes(&lt;1  %).  Accumulation  occurs  only  when  repeated  high  doses  are  administered  at  short intervals. It is therefore to be expected that the small quantity of trometamol present in the formulation (pH 7.4) will be excreted very rapidly. In the acute toxicity studies made for this indication the vehicle for  the  concentrated  ibuprofen  solution  was  the  same  as  the  formulation  to  be  marketed  and  at  the maximum administrable volume, 10 ml/kg, the vehicle was indistinguishable from the saline control. The volume administered was five times the therapeutic dose.

In  a  study  investigating  toxicity  in  animals,  reported  in  1961,  the  intravenous  LD50  for  0.3  M trometamol in mice was 16.5 mmols/kg (55 ml of this solution) (Roberts et al., 1961). Convulsions were observed immediately before death. Neutralising the solution with HCl (pH 7.4) decreased the LD50 value to 12.9 mmole/kg (29 ml of this solution), i.e. approximately 150 times the quantity in the proposed therapeutic dose. There were no observable effects in mice or rabbits given bolus injections of  50  ml/day  of  a  0.155  M  solution  (i.e.  about  half  the  LD50)  for  10  days,  whether  alkaline  or acidified, about 75 times the proposed therapeutic dose, given at three times the concentration of this formulation.

The toleration of quantities much higher than the LD50 when given slowly confirms that trometamol is very rapidly excreted and the greater quantity tolerated when buffered to a physiological pH is in conformity with its being excreted faster in the ionised state (it is ~80% dissociated at pH 7.4).

The effects of trometamol on PVR and blood flow at varying oxygen tensions have been investigated in neonatal calves (Rudolph et al., 1966). When ventilated with pure oxygen, infusion of trometamol buffer  decreased  pulmonary vascular resistance in proportion to the increase in blood pH achieved, with a corresponding increase in pulmonary blood flow and, although PVR was increased by hypoxia at  acid  pH,  decreasing  the  oxygen  concentration  of  the  inspired  air  had  minimal  effect  on  PVR  at blood pH ~7 3. The direct effect of trometamol infusion on the pulmonary vasculature would therefore be opposite to that required to cause the observed cases of hypoxaemia (see clinical safety).

Un-ionised trometamol can slowly penetrates  erythrocytes  (Ben-Isaac  et  al.,  1972).  The  increase  in intracellular pH increases the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen (Bohr effect) and, after infusion of the quantity of alkaline trometamol used in the treatment of acidaemia, contributes to arterial hypoxia. Trometamol buffered to pH 7.4 does not enter erythrocytes and again the adverse events in the clinical trial cannot be attributed to this effect.

Trometamol  also  acts  as  an  osmotic  diuretic,  which  further  promotes  the  excretion  of  not  only bicarbonate  but  also  other  weak  organic  acid  anions  such  as  salicylate  and  therefore  ibuprofen.  It seems unlikely that the dose being administered with this formulation will decreases the plasma halflife  of  ibuprofen  to  any  significant  extent.  The  hypoglycaemia  reported  after  infusion  of  doses  in excess of 500mg/kg (4mmol/kg) of alkaline trometamol also results from increased insulin release at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

an  alkaline  intracellular  pH  and  cannot  occur  after  the  infusion  of  small  quantities  of  buffered trometamol.

## Impurities

Process  and  degradation  impurities  consist  of  substances  related  to  ibuprofen.  Two  of  these  (2-[4butylphenyl] propionic acid and 4-isobutylacetophenone) are present in all ibuprofen preparations and are within the limits prescribed in the Ph. Eur. The databases RTECS, HSDB, TSCA, OHMT ABS, CHRIS, IRIS, CHEMBANK and DOSE have been searched and no reports of toxicity relating to these compounds or to the four compounds specific to this preparation have been found.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Art. 8  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  requires  the  applicant  to  indicate  any  potential  risks exhibited by the medicinal product for the environment and to perform an evaluation, if applicable, of the precautionary and safety measures to be taken during the storage of the product, the environmental release following use in patients as well as the disposal of unused or waste products.

Pedea is intended for the treatment of PDA in premature neonates. The maximum prevalence of this cardiac disorder in the EU was estimated to 2.13 per 10,000 persons by the COMP during the Orphan Designation procedure. If one considers that the overall PDA prevalence without any considerations of the  gestational  age  is  31%,  the  total  number  of  neonates  in  the  EU  presenting  a  PDA  would  be theoretically 80,000 in 2000. Therefore, if one considers that the maximum dosage for 2 full courses of treatment (i.e. 3 injections x 2) is 40 mg/kg/patient [(10 + 5 + 5) x 2] and that the maximum body weight of a neonate is 3 kg, the quantity of the medicinal product to be consumed per year in the EU would not represent more than 9.6 kg of ibuprofen (40.10 -6 x 80,000 x 3).

The applicant therefore considers that it is not relevant to assess the environmental risk of ibuprofen and related compounds' release in the water compartment. Indeed this quantity, which is obviously overestimated, is very negligible compared to the large quantity of ibuprofen used in other non-orphan indications. Given the low extent of use of ibuprofen in the present claimed indication and the absence of  any  genotoxic  potential,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  Pedea  may  represent  a  risk  for  the  environment following  its  prescribed  usage  in  the  target  population  or  further  to  its  accidental  release  and dispersion into the environment.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The applicant has  conducted two novel studies to  support the current application: an acute toxicity study in the weaned and adult rat; and a local tolerance study in the rabbit. These were conducted to support the safety evaluation of i.v. ibuprofen for the current indication. The remainder of the nonclinical part of the application is bibliographic.

The cited literature varies by age: Research published between 1960 and 1989 (n=34) may be lacking methodologically in comparison with those published since 1990 (n=65). However, confidence in the data from these older studies comes from the unity of results with more recent studies, and in the light of  the  vast  clinical  experience  with  ibuprofen.    There  are  sufficient  data  available  on  ibuprofen  to support pre-clinical safety, with relevant clinical data taking precedence. Thus there would be little to gain from the conduct of further pre-clinical studies. Further, in relation to the indication sought, the product is to be administered in life-threatening situations by highly specialised practitioners.

The  published literature fulfils the level of detail necessary to substantiate the non-clinical pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of ibuprofen for the proposed clinical indication of intravenous use in premature human neonates to close a PDA. The published literature is extensive and much of it has been in the public domain for at least twenty years.  It is considered that the  normal  dossier  requirements  are  satisfied  and  the  application  can  be  considered  a  full  'mixed' application in accordance with art. 8 (3) and Annex I part II.7 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

## Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic profile of ibuprofen has been extensively characterised (Coceani et al., 1980, Coceani et al., 1994, Smith et al., 1994, Loftin et al., 2001, Van der Veyver et al., 1993, Momma et al., 1983, Momma et al., 1984, Momma et al., 1990, Adams et al., 1969, Sharpe et al., 1974, Coceani et al., 1979, Friedman et al., 1976, Heyman et al., 1976, Malcolm et al., 1993, Coleman et al., 1994, Segi et al., 1998, Nguyen et al., 1997, Bhattacharya et al., 1999, Smith et al., 1995, Clyman et al., 1983, Clyman et al., 1999, Hörnblad et al., 1967, Hammerman et al., 2001) but there are no useful animal models of the postnatal patent DA. However, there is little doubt that DA patency is maintained by systemic prostaglandins, and that, although a drop in circulating prostaglandin levels is not normally the primary defining event of DA closure, the administration of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (in  this  case  ibuprofen)  trigger  the  required  constriction  of  the  ductus  musculature,  thus  effecting closure. This principle has been adequately demonstrated clinically, and further preclinical pharmacology studies are not required for the proposed indication.

The applicant discusses secondary pharmacodynamic effects of NSAIDs extensively. There are good non-clinical data available to support  the use of ibuprofen  in favour  of the  reference  drug indomethacin,  which  is  known  to  cause  adverse  events  unrelated  to  inhibition  of  prostaglandin synthesis in the proposed patient population (see also clinical part).

## Pharmacokinetics

The known PK profile of ibuprofen, along with the superiority of clinical PK data on neonates negates the requirement to conduct further investigations in animals (Aranda et al., 199, Kelley et al., 1992, Warner et al., 1986, Rey et al., 1994).

## Toxicology

The toxicology programme is very limited but in view of the extensive preclinical and clinical data already available relating to the biological properties of ibuprofen this is considered acceptable.

The acute i.v. study in the weaned and adult rat does not add to our knowledge of ibuprofen toxicity. However, the applicant to generate a crude but acceptable calculation of a safety factor uses it. In  the  acute  toxicity  study,  symptoms  consistent  with  CNS  depression  were  observed.    This  was considered to be the cause of death at high doses since almost all deaths occurred rapidly. Based on the maximum non-lethal dose of 265mg/kg and reasonable assumptions of blood volume in rats  and  human  neonates,  the  applicant  has  calculated  a  safety  margin  of  ~45x  compared  with  the effective clinical dose.

I.v. repeat-dose toxicity studies are not available, however, it is accepted that conduct of such studies would add little to the current knowledge base (Davies et al., 1993, Aranda et al., 1997, Low et al., 1963, Van Overmeire et al., 1999, Oldham et al., 1986).

There  are  no  concerns  with  regards  to  mutagenicity  /  carcinogenicity  for  the  current  indication (Oldham et al., 1986, Shoba et al., 1985, Philipose  et  al.,  1997,  Tucker  et  al.,  1993,  Kullich  et  al., 1986, Ozkulet al., 1996, Sardas et al., 1991, Sardas et al., 1994, Rosenberg et al., 1991, Nicholson et al., 1998,  Brocks et al., 1999, Brinkman et al., 1960).

The applicant has provided a rationale for the safety of small amounts of trometamol present in the formulation (Brinkman et al., 1960, Nahas et al., 1963, Nahas et al., 1998, Rudolph et al., 1966, BenIsaac et al., 1972).

The local tolerance study conducted for this application demonstrated mechanical damage in treated and control animals, and that ibuprofen has an initial, beneficial, effect due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

In  consideration  of  the  proposed  indication  and  patient  population,  and  in  light  of  clinical  data gathered  from  over  1000  preterm  newborns,  the  toxicity  profile  of  ibuprofen  is  acceptable  for  the current indication. All preclinical data considered relevant to clinical safety have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pedea. With the exception of an acute toxicity study, no further studies have been carried out in juvenile animals with Pedea.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## GCP

The  clinical  studies  conducted  by  the  applicant  were  of  good  scientific  quality,  and  appear  well conducted and reported. Studies from the literature have, with occasional exceptions, been published in peer-reviewed journals; the standard ranges from excellent to acceptable. No evident problems arise from GCP issues.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

## Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption - Bioavailability

Study  report  9-33/93 describes  a  healthy  volunteer  trial  in  twelve  adult  male  and  female  subjects carried out in 1993 using an intravenous formulation of ibuprofen. Each subject received a single dose of 400 mg in 50 ml water for injection infused over 15 minutes; blood samples were taken at intervals over the ensuing eight hours: the resultant pharmacokinetic variables are shown in the table below.

Much  of  the  published  efficacy  data  on  closure  of  PDA  were  generated  using  an  intramuscular preparation  of  ibuprofen  lysine  (Imbun ® )  administered  intravenously.  In  order  to  establish  the comparability of that preparation and Pedea the applicant has conducted a bioavailability study of the two preparations.

Study IBU/00/BIOEQ/FR compared the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen in eighteen healthy adult male volunteers who received single intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg infused over 15 minutes in an open label, two-way crossover design.

## Distribution

In Study IBU/PROPHYL/2000 undertaken by the applicant, V (taken to mean volume of distribution) is listed as having a group mean of 238 (s.d. 125) ml. The publication by Aranda et al., 1997, gives a mean  (s.d.)  of  62.1  (3.9)  ml/kg;  and  that  by  Van  Overmeire  et  al.  1999,  0.35  (0.15)  L/kg.    For reference the volume of distribution in human adults cited in the literature is frequently ten litres and above depending on the study and the enantiomer.

Studies of distribution in human body fluids, e.g. synovial, skin blister, CSF, have been carried out (Brocks et al., 1999); as they are not directly relevant to the application they are not further discussed here.

Ibuprofen is highly (~99%) protein bound in adults, but did Aranda et al bind only 95% in the study.

## Elimination

Ibuprofen  is  extensively  metabolised  in  the  liver  to  pharmacologically  inactive  metabolites.  It  is mainly oxidized followed by acyl-glucuronidation. Two major metabolites account for 35% and 26% of drug related material recovered in urine.  The principle agents of metabolism are cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 (Brocks et al., 1999).

Ibuprofen has two optical isomers the R form is pharmacodynamically inactive or little active. In vivo the R from is metabolised to the S form with about 60% completeness.  The opposite conversion is thought not to occur.

Ibuprofen  is  mainly  excreted  in  the  urine  (about  80%)  as  unchanged  (1%)  or  acyl-glucuronidated ibuprofen  (10-13%),  but  mostly  in  the  form  of  its  metabolites:  hydroxy  ibuprofen  25%,  carboxy ibuprofen 45% Biliary elimination of ibuprofen and its metabolites is a minor pathway (&lt; 2%).

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

There is good evidence of dose proportionality and linearity in adult volunteers and patients at doses commonly used in therapeutic practice. However, there is no experimental evidence that this is also the case in neonates. The frequent blood sampling necessary to formally define dose proportionality and time dependency makes it unfeasible in premature infants.

## Target population

Study  IBU025329-PK  was  a  clinical  and  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  of  the  effect  of  ibuprofen  on closure of the DA in premature infants of 28 weeks gestation or less. An initial injection of 10 mg ibuprofen was given within six hours of birth, two subsequent 5 mg injections were given at 24 and 48 hours;  blood  samples  were  also  taken  at  those  times.  Infants  who  had  ultrasonic  evidence  of  PDA received a subsequent 'curative' treatment according to the same schedule. Population pharmacokinetic methods and modelling were used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters.

Sixty-two infants were studied, 33 male and 29 female, their mean gestational age was 26.6 weeks and weight  at  Day  3  was  0.82  kg.    Only  10  infants  received  'curative'  treatment  and  PK  data  are  not available for all of them. Although not a formal estimate of Cmax the data could be considered as a reasonable approximation.

## Special populations

## Impaired renal/hepatic function

A review by D. Brocks and F. Jamali  (The Pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen in humans and animals, Published Taylor and Francis, 1999) indicates that the plasma concentrations of the s-enantiomer were raised in the presence of renal impairment. The authors note a similar finding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Quantitative data are not given.

## Gender

There  is  reasonable  evidence  that  there  is  not  a  gender  difference  in  adults  with  respect  to  the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen. There are no data in neonates; however, although pharmacokinetics in neonates may be different from adults there is no reason to suspect a gender difference.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

A published review by Van Overmeire et al., 2000, provides a good overview of the mechanism of action  of  ibuprofen.  The  applicant  has  not  carried  out  any  studies  of  the  pharmacodynamics  of ibuprofen.

In  the  normal  foetus  the  DA  connects  the  main  pulmonary  trunk  to  the  descending  aorta.  It  differs from other vessels of the foetal circulation in that the media is composed mainly of a spiral layer of muscle  fibre  and  the  intima  is  thicker  and  develops  mounds  or  cushions  in  the  third  trimester  of pregnancy; functionally it could be regarded as a sphincter.

Constriction of the musculature of the ductus is inhibited by local and circulating prostaglandins and by low oxygen tension of the blood. At birth the lungs expand and arterial  oxygen  content rapidly rises, circulating prostaglandin levels fall: these changes will tend to initiate ductal closure. However in  premature  infants  circulating  prostaglandin  levels  are  higher  than  at  term,  and  respiratory difficulties may lead to a state of hypoxia; both of which contribute to the failure of the ductus to close leading  to  abnormal  haemodynamics.  Non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  reduce prostaglandin levels and promote closure of the DA.  The incidence of PDA is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birth weight of the infant. For full term babies it is about 1:2000; for very low birth weight babies it is about 35%, and for those with respiratory distress syndrome it is about 45-50%.

## Primary pharmacology

Varvarigou et al., 1996, published the first study of prophylactic ibuprofen in the prevention of PDA. They investigated the effect of a single dose of ibuprofen lysine 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg at 24 and 28 hours (n = 12) or single dose of ibuprofen lysine 10 mg/kg  (n = 11) or a single dose of saline. The three-dose schedule was chosen on the basis of the recommendations of fever reduction and the one dose to assess the minimum effective dose. The multiple dose-regimen gave a sustained reduction in PGE2 levels and its metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 α followed the same pattern.

Mean (s.d.) prostaglandin E2 levels (pg/ml) following single and repeat doses of ibuprofen

|                             | Pre dose   | 24 hours    | 48 hours   | 72 hours    |
|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| PGE 2 following single dose | 1871 (696) | 1171 (1903) | 383 (265)  | 3232 (2420) |
| PGE 2 following three doses | 1867 (641) | 717 (349)   | 622 (168)  | 810 (304)   |

Although the Varvarigou study lacks untreated control data to indicate changes in prostaglandins with time the differences between the short and long treatments strongly indicate a treatment effect. There were  benefits  for  the  three  dose  regimen  in  terms  of  duct  closure,  less  requirement  for  ventilatory support and shorter hospital stay compared to the single dose and saline treatments: the effects of the latter two appeared very similar. The paper effectively set the state of the art for ibuprofen intervention

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in terms of dose and was copied by subsequent investigators. The applicant subsequently carried out a small study trying to further investigate the optimal dose-regimen (see clinical efficacy).

## Secondary pharmacology

## Cerebral blood flow

Mosca  et  al.,  1997,  compared  the  efficacy  and  effects  on  cerebral  blood  volume,  blood  flow  and oxygenation of 0.2 mg/kg of indomethacin (n = 8) or 10 mg/kg ibuprofen (n = 8) in infants of less than 31 weeks gestation with confirmed PDA. Both treatments were given as single doses infused over one minute. Cerebral blood volume was measured by near infrared spectroscopy. For indomethacin, mean (s.d.) blood volume was 2.4 (0.4) ml/100 g before treatment and 1.9 (0.3) ml/100 g after treatment; the equivalent  figures  for  ibuprofen  were  2.7  (0.3)  ml/100  g  and  3.1  ml/100  g  the  difference  is  not statistically  significant,  however a significant  difference (p = 0.02) was seen in cerebral blood flow which was reduced by 62 (318) µ L/100 g following indomethacin and increased by 207 (200) µ L/100 g one hour after administration of indomethacin and ibuprofen respectively.

Mosca et al., 1999, demonstrated in a non-comparative open study that ibuprofen 10 mg/kg infused over one minute did not alter cerebral vasoreactivity to a transient increase in arterial CO2 tension. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

Naulaers et al., 2002, studied changes in cerebral blood volume associated with administration of 10 mg/kg of ibuprofen or the same volume of normal saline (placebo). For both interventions there was a mean change (95% C.I.) in cerebral blood volume of 0.3 (0 - 0.06) ml/100 g.

Patel  et  al.,  1995,  compared  the  efficacy  and  effects  on  cerebral  blood  flow  of  0.1  mg/kg  of indomethacin (n = 15) or 10-mg/kg ibuprofen (n = 6) or 5-mg/kg ibuprofen in infants of less than 28 weeks  gestation  with  confirmed  PDA.  Change  in  cerebral  volume  (CBV)  was  measured  by  near infrared spectroscopy. For ibuprofen (both doses) the median change in CBV was 0 ml/100 g (25 th to 75 th centiles = 0.1 to -0.1 ml/100 g). For indomethacin the median change was -0.4 ml/100 g (-0.3 to 0.5).

Patel et al., 2000, in a double blind trial, compared the efficacy and effects on cerebral blood flow of 0.20 - 0.25 mg/kg of indomethacin three doses 12 hourly (n = 15); or 10/5/5 mg/kg ibuprofen three doses 24 hourly (n=18) in premature infants with confirmed  PDA. Change in cerebral blood flow, measured  by  near  infra-red  spectroscopy,  following  the  first  dose  was  the  primary  comparator  For indomethacin the mean (s.d.) CBF was 13.6 (4.1) ml/100 g/min before and 8.3 (3.1) ml/100 g/min after treatment.  For ibuprofen CBF was 13.3 (3.2) ml/100 g/min before and 14.9 (4.7) ml/100 g/min after treatment.

Romagnoli at al., 2000, conducted a non-comparative open study of the effects of administration of 10 mg/kg ibuprofen (Arfen ® ) infused as a single dose over 30 minutes on cerebral blood flow in infants of gestational age thirty weeks or less. Thirteen had echocardiographic evidence of PDA and four did not.  Blood  flow  was  measured  by  doplar  ultrasonography.  The  authors  conclude  that  there  were favourable haemodynamic changes in the PDA group but not in those without PDA.

## Renal blood flow

The  Romagnoli  at  al.  study  cited  above  also  studied  renal  blood  flow  by  means  of  doplar ultrasonography; and the authors' conclusions also apply to renal blood flow.

Pezzati et al., 1999, conducted an open study comparing the effects of 0.2 mg/kg indomethacin (n = 8) and  10  mg/kg  ibuprofen  (n  =  9)  infused  over  15  minutes  on  renal  blood  flow  (measured  by ultrasonography)  in  infants  of  33  weeks  gestational  age  or  less  with  PDA.  There  were  statistically significant reductions in renal blood flow following indomethacin but not ibuprofen.

## Mesenteric blood flow

Mesenteric  blood  flow  was  also  measured  in  the  Pezzati  et  al.  paper  cited  above  and  found  to  be reduced following indomethacin but not ibuprofen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical Events/complications

Events of clinical significance related to prematurity and/or PDA and blood flow in specified organs are as follows:

- -cerebral blood flow = IVH
- -renal blood flow = renal failure, oliguria, fluid overload
- -mesenteric blood flow = necrotising enterocolitis, intestinal perforation.

Patel et al., 2000, refers to one indomethacin treated patient who developed necrotising enterocolitis. Otherwise there is no mention in the studies of the clinical events listed, suggesting they did not occur or if they did they are not reported.

## Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

The applicant has not formally addressed this topic. However, given the  very large intra-individual variability  for  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ibuprofen  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  meaningful  information could  be  provided.    No  equivalent  data  have  been  found  in  the  much  wider  published  literature  on indomethacin.

## Interaction studies

The applicant has not carried out any specific interaction studies, relying only on the clinical trial data, where concomitant medication is common. Neonatal intensive care is a complex situation with high morbidity and mortality where drug interactions may not be obvious.

Clinical  experience  shows  that,  almost  inevitably,  neonates  with  PDA  will  receive  multiple  comedications as well as ibuprofen. No evidence of an interaction emerges, but such is the morbidity of the population the possibility cannot be excluded with certainty.

Based on published data, as a NSAID, ibuprofen may interact with the following medicinal products:

- -diuretics:  ibuprofen  may  reduce  the  effect  of  diuretics;  diuretics  can  increase  the  risk  of nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs in dehydrated patients.
- -anticoagulants:  ibuprofen  may  increase  the  effect  of  anticoagulants  and  enhance  the  risk  of bleeding.
- -corticosteroids: ibuprofen may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- -nitric  oxide:  since both  medicinal products inhibit platelet function, their combination may in theory increase the risk of bleeding.
- -other NSAIDs: the concomitant use of more than one NSAID should be avoided because of the increased risk of adverse reactions.

Adequate information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

## Genetic differences in PD response

As discussed above it is possible that some of the inter-individual variability in blood levels may be due to polymorphism of CYP isoenzymes.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  Pedea  was  first  studied  in  healthy  volunteers  (Pharmakin  1993  and Bioequivalence  study  2000).  In  addition,  during  the  dose  range  study  performed  on  the  product (Moriette  et  al.,  2003)  and  as  part  of  the  trial  on  Pedea  comparing  prophylactic  versus  curative ibuprofen  (Cephac  pharmacokinetic  report  2003),  pharmacokinetics  parameters  were  determined. Finally,  two  publications  support  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ibuprofen  administered  intravenously (Aranda et al., 1997, and Van Overmeire et al., 2001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ibuprofen is a propionic acid derivative with two isomers; most anti-inflammatory activity is attributed to the S-isomer.  Pedea is the racemic form and in common with other ibuprofen preparations there is uni-directional conversion of the R- to the S-enantiomer.

It is metabolised in the liver by oxidation and subsequent aryl glucoronidation to inactive metabolites. Hydroxylated metabolites have also been identified. Metabolism involves cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 and CYP2C8.

CYP2C activity is low until one week after birth and then rises to a third of the adult level within a month, irrespective of gestational age. Glucuronidation is also reduced in the newborn. Other factors in pre-term neonates that influence kinetics include reduced renal function, concomitant therapy, and albumin and bilirubin concentrations.

About 80% is excreted in the urine, 1% as unchanged and the rest as metabolites. Biliary excretion is &lt;2%.

The applicant's bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers has provided sufficient data to evaluate the pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  both  formulations  discussed  in  the  literature:  the  i.m.  ibuprofen lysinate  formulation  administered  intravenously  and  the  Pedea  formulation.  Data  showed  that  there was  no  statistical  difference  between  pharmacokinetics  of  ibuprofen  as  a  free  base  and  ibuprofen lysinate administered intravenously.

After a loading dose of 10 mg/kg, peak concentrations in the three studies in premature newborns were similar at 35-40 µg/ml.  Residual concentrations were about 10-15 µg/ml 24 hours after the last dose of 5 mg/kg in two studies.  Concentrations tended to be higher in those with a lower gestational age. The peak plasma concentrations measured in premature infants were similar to those obtained from infants and children after oral ibuprofen.  In contrast, slower elimination caused a longer half-life in the premature, being about 30 hours compared to 1.5-2 hours in infants more than three months of age. Clearance increases with gestational age from 24-28 weeks.

With reference to study IBU025329-PK, the figures for blood levels at 72 hours are based on only 4 infants in whom curative treatment was given and for whom blood drug level data are available.

What  is  evident  from  the  data  is  the  very  considerable  inter-individual  variation  in  blood  levels. Similar  high  variability  is  also  evident  from  published  studies.  Aranda  et  al.  found  a  five-fold difference between the lowest and highest individual elimination rate constant and Van Overmeire et al.  found  elimination  rates  ranging  from  1.5  to  26.1  mg/kg/h.  Both  authors  comment  that  the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen were not evidently related to infants' birth weight or gestational age and  speculate  that  the  very  high  inter-individual  variability  may  be  due  to  genetic  polymorphism particularly of CYP2C and/or differences in protein binding.

The  volume  of  distribution  was  about  200  ml/kg.  Protein  binding  in  cord  blood  was  about  95% compared to 99% in adult plasma. In common with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen is bound to albumin and might displace bilirubin.

An in vitro study calculated that at 155 µg/ml, high by therapeutic standards, ibuprofen could displace bilirubin to increase the free fraction of bilirubin by about four-fold, Cooper-Peel et al., 1996.  This might increase the risk  of  bilirubin  encephalopathy  in  sick  premature  infants.    However,  Ma  et  al., 2002, suggested that significant bilirubin displacement is unlikely at therapeutic concentrations until an ibuprofen concentration in the region of 285 µg/ml (see clinical safety).

## Pharmacodynamics

The applicant has not carried out any studies of the pharmacodynamics of ibuprofen. However, the pharmacodynamic  action  of  ibuprofen  in  closure  of  PDA  is  reasonably  well  understood  from  the published literature. There is considerably less understanding of the direct and indirect (through duct closure) effects on organ blood flow.

The applicant has reviewed pertinent publications addressing this topic either in animals or in human newborn infants. The applicant focused on the effects of ibuprofen on cerebral haemodynamics and on mesenteric  and  renal  blood  flow.  Further,  the  applicant  has  provided  sufficient  justifications  why additional pharmacodynamics studies were not deemed necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  NSAIDs  reduced  foetal  urine  output  and  hence  amniotic  fluid  volume,  these  drugs,  which  are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, were used to treat polyhydramnios. The observation that -among others - indomethacin may also lead to a premature closure of the foetal ductus in utero prompted its development to the treatment of PDA of preterm newborns.

In  a  multicentre  trial  involving  babies  under  1,750 g  birthweight  (Gersony  et  al.,  1983)  who  had developed  a  symptomatic  PDA,  indomethacin  closed  the  PDA  within  48  hours  in  nearly  80%  of infants, whereas spontaneous closure occurred in less than 30% of controls. Further on, many other studies have demonstrated similar results.

In an early administration trial of the drug, neonatologists showed that the primary pharmacodynamic effects of ibuprofen on the DA were supported by its direct effect on prostaglandins (Varvarigou et al., 1996).

Ibuprofen  inhibits  cyclooxygenase.  In  pre-term  infants  it  significantly  reduces  the  concentration  of both PGE2 and prostacyclin, as measured by its 6-keto metabolite. As indomethacin is thought to act by the same mechanism, no further primary mechanism of action studies were performed.

The applicant presented a review of five randomised double-blind studies, which measured cerebral haemodynamics in pre-term newborns.

As for indomethacin, the pharmacodynamics effects of ibuprofen on the cerebral hemodynamics of preterm newborns presenting with PDA were investigated (Patel et al., 1995, and Patel et al., 2000). Both studies were comparative to indomethacin and they used the same formulation of ibuprofen as the  one  referred  to  in  the  present  application,  i.e.  Pedea.  The  first  exploratory  study  was  only published as a letter to the editor and the second one was published several years after its completion. Both confirmed the favourable effect of ibuprofen on cerebral hemodynamics as observed in animals, and confirmed their own previous findings on indomethacin.

In a similar study carried out with ibuprofen lysinate, results were in line (Mosca et al., 1997). A more recent  pharmacodynamics study confirmed the  absence of cerebral effects  of  ibuprofen  on  cerebral hemodynamics (Mosca et al., 1999).

More  recently,  results as part of  a  large  comparative  and  prophylactic  trial  showed  similar pharmacodynamic results on cerebral hemodynamics. Ibuprofen, at the proposed therapeutic dose, was no different from placebo in terms of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, Naulaers et al., 2002. Finally, a Doppler study performed on peripheral organs usually affected by indomethacin, i.e. on the main arteries  of  the  gut  and  of  the  kidney,  confirmed  the  favourable  pharmacodynamics  profile  on peripheral circulation of ibuprofen as compared to indomethacin (Pezzati et al., 1999). In infants with a gestational age less than 33 weeks, ibuprofen lysine 10 mg/kg, n=9, did not decrease mesenteric and renal blood flow, whereas indomethacin 0.2 mg/kg, n=8, did, Pezzati et al., 1999.

It  is  thought,  from  an  open  label  study  by  Romagnoli  et  al.,  2000,  that  ibuprofen  did  not  have  a detrimental  effect  on  cerebral  blood  flow  when  the  PDA  is  closed,  but  that  there  is  a  rapid improvement in renal and cerebral blood flow secondary to the effect of the drug in closing the ductus and  stopping  the  left  to  right  shunt.  In  a  prophylactic  study  carried  out  with  ibuprofen  lysinate, Romagnoli  confirmed  that  any  hemodynamics  modification  of  cerebral  or  renal  blood  flow  were related to ibuprofen's primary effect on the PDA.

## Clinical efficacy

The applicant has conducted a dose-range study (Moriette et al., 2003) in order to determine whether the empirical dose regimen was effectively associated with the best efficacy/safety ratio. In addition, the  applicant  has  performed  another  study  with  Pedea  comparing  curative  versus  prophylactic ibuprofen administration (Rozé et al., 2003).

In addition, 15 publications support the efficacy of ibuprofen to close a PDA.

## Dose response study

## IBU/99/Dose range

## Description of the study:

The trial was conducted in 2000-2001 at Hôpital Cochin, Paris, in a non-placebo controlled design. The primary objective of this study was to determine the lowest effective dose of Pedea required to obtain a PDA closure rate of 80% in preterm neonates of 27-29 weeks of gestational age and in 50% of neonates with 24-26 weeks of gestational age.

For inclusion patients had to be within the specified gestational ages and to have echocardiographic evidence of  PDA and to be at least 72 hours and no more than 120 hours old. Ductal closure was assessed by echocardiography and had to occur within 72 hours of treatment initiation.  Patients were treated with ibuprofen infused over 15 minutes every 24 hours according to the following regimens:

- 5 - 2.5 - 2.5 mg/kg;
- 15 - 7.5 - 7.5 mg/kg;
- 10 - 5 - 5 mg/kg;
- 20 - 10 - 10 mg/kg.

The trial employed a continual re-evaluation (Baysian) design. Cohorts of three patients were assigned to each dose and following review of the outcome the dose/response relationship was re-evaluated, and  the  dose  closest  to  giving  an  80%  probability  is  chosen  as  the  dose  for  the  next  cohort.  This process is repeated until 20 patients have been recruited.

## Outcome:

Two  different  sub-analyses  were  undertaken;  one  in  infants  aged  27-29  weeks  of  gestational  age (n=21) and one in infants aged 24-26 weeks of gestational age (n=22).

21 infants aged 27-29 weeks of gestational age were recruited, one of whom died.  They received three doses of Pedea ibuprofen, which were 5-2.5-2.5 mg, n=2; 10-5-5 mg, n=8; 15-7.5-7.5 mg, n=11; and no patients were allocated to the highest proposed dose of 20-10-10 mg.   The PDA closure rates in the three treated groups were 0/1 (the other infant in this group, who received Pedea, died), 6/8 and 10/11. In the four patients whose PDA did not close, one infant at the 5 mg/kg dose closed with three days of the last infusion, and one at the 15 mg/kg dose closed within five days.  Two required surgical closure, both  at  the  10  mg/kg  dose,  after  one  was  given  a  repeat  dose  of  ibuprofen  and  one  indomethacin, without success.

The median ibuprofen concentration at 72 hours was 17 µg/ml in both the closure and non-closure group and success did not correlate with the ibuprofen plasma concentration.

From these small numbers the applicant chose the dose 10-5-5 mg as the minimally effective dose.

## Main study

## IBU/PROPHYL/2000

This  study  was  a  double-blind  placebo  controlled  trial  conducted  in  eleven  centres  in  France  from March 2001 to March 2002.

## Outcomes/endpoints:

The primary aim was to compare the proportion of patients requiring surgical ligation of PDA after prophylactic versus after curative administration of intravenous ibuprofen.

The  main  pre-specified  analysis  was  a  comparison  of  prophylactic  treatment  with  ibuprofen  as compared to placebo.

The second pre-specified analysis was a comparison of curative treatment with ibuprofen as compared to placebo.

The proportion of patients experiencing specified complications of PDA/prematurity (e.g. intraventricular haemorrhage) was a secondary efficacy/safety comparison.

## Study participants:

Patients were to be premature neonates with a gestational age of less than 28 weeks; and to be less than  six  hours  old  at  the  time  of  randomisation.  Patients  with  other  major  illness  not  related  to prematurity  (e.g.  infection)  were  excluded,  as  were  patients  where  the  mother  had  used  potentially nephrotoxic medication in the three days prior to delivery.

## Randomisation and treatments:

Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) to; prophylactic ibuprofen 10 mg/kg as a loading dose with two subsequent intravenous infusions of 5 mg/kg at 24 hour intervals, or to placebo (an equivalent volume on  0.9%  saline  given  at  equivalent  times).  Both  treatments  were  initiated  on  Day  1  of  the study.

The need for surgical ligation was based on [persistence of] PDA with the criteria described below and at  least  one  of  the  following;  need  for  mechanical  ventilation  or  CPAP;  impossibility  of  enteral feeding as defined by an increase of less than 12 ml/day for three days.

## Echocardiographic evaluation:

The  need  for  a  curative  (open)  treatment  with  ibuprofen  was  determined  by  echocardiographic evidence  of  a  haemodynamically  significant  PDA  with  at  least  two  of  the  following  criteria  being present; left atrial/aortic root ratio &gt; 1.48; retrograde or absent flow in the anterior cerebral artery or the descending thoracic aorta; pulsatile flow in the ductus arteriosus; diastolic flow in the pulmonary artery of &gt; 20 cm/s. Echocardiographic evaluations of the ductus arteriosus were performed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, at discharge from the centre and at any other time considered clinically necessary.

## Sample size:

The  patient  sample  size  estimate  was  based  on  a  historically  controlled  study  showing  a  surgical ligation rate of 21% with the prophylactic method and 41% with the 'curative' method. The minimum sample size to give 80% power of detecting a difference with α = 0.05 was 83 patients; however the target number was set at 110 because of the expected mortality rate of 25%.

## Recruitment:

Late  in  2001  there  were  three  reports,  in  infants  who  had  received  prophylactic  treatment,  of hypoxaemic pulmonary hypertension following the loading dose of ibuprofen administered within the first  six  hours  of  life  in  very  premature  infants?  This  led  to  the  halting  of  the  study  when approximately 60% of the intended number of patients had been recruited.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

Due  to  the  fact  that  the  study  was  halted  prematurely,  the  main  pre-specified  analysis  was  the comparison  of  66  patients  treated  prophylactically  with  placebo  compared  with  65  patients  who received prophylactic ibuprofen.

The  second  analysis  was  of  25  patients  initially  assigned  to  placebo  but  then  requiring  curative treatment  with  ibuprofen  at  a  later  stage  in  line  with  the  echocardiography  requirements  discussed above.

## Primary analysis

The main demographic characteristics of the enrolled study population are shown in the table below. There were minor but non-significant differences in some variables such as home/hospital delivery but in general the treatment populations were well matched.

## Baseline characteristics of the study populations

| Median gestational age (weeks) | 26               | 26                   | NS |
| Birth weight (range in kg)     | 0.43 - 1.18      | 0.3 - 1.30           | NS |
| Mechanical ventilation (%)     | 94               | 88                   | NS |
| Surfactant treatment (%)       | 83               | 83                   | NS |

47 of the 66 patients who were treated prophylactically with ibuprofen and 47 of the 65 patients, who received  placebo, reached  36 weeks of gestational  age. In those  children who reached  36 weeks of gestational age, 5/47 in the placebo group and 0/47 in the prophylaxis group required surgery.

The tables below give the outcome in terms of the primary variable, requirement for surgery, and also in terms of the clinical complications of prematurity.

## Secondary analysis

In  total  there  were  25  preterm  infants  who  required  curative  treatment  with  ibuprofen,  mean gestational age 26 weeks, range 24-27; mean birth weight 850 gm, range 630-1180. They were treated with  Pedea  (ibuprofen)  in  three  doses  of  10-5-5  mg,  each  dose  at  24-hour  intervals  given  by  slow intravenous infusion. At recruitment they all had a visible PDA on echocardiogram with at least two of the four criteria discussed above.

## PDA closure occurred in 12 (48%); back up indomethacin was given to 9 (36%); and surgical ligation carried out in 6 (24%).

Six of the infants died (24%), Five had an intraventricular haemorrhage grade III-IV (20%); one had periventricular leukomalacia (4%); and ten had bronchopulmonary dysplasia of the 19 who were alive at 36 weeks post conceptual age.  At least one renal side effect occurred in 6 (24%): urine output &lt;1 ml/kg in one; use of diuretic in three; sodium &lt;130 mmol/l in two (see clinical safety).

## Supportive studies

The  outcome  of  supportive  studies  is  shown  in  the  tables  below.  The  only  direct  (within  study) comparison  of  prophylactic  and  therapeutic  'rescue'  ibuprofen  is  in  the  publication  by  Dani  et  al., 2000, which demonstrated a highly significant (p  = 0.001) reduction in PDA on the third day of life with prophylactic use but no benefit in terms of the complications of prematurity/PDA. The patients had a mean gestational age of 29 weeks.

Data for ductus closure rates from papers, which carried out a head to head comparison of ibuprofen and  indomethacin,  are  shown  in  the  table  below.    It  is  evident  that  although  there  is  considerable variability between studies overall there is similarity within studies.

* Data from Ohlsson A, Walia R, Shah S.  Ibuprofen for the treatment of a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(2):CD003481.  ** weeks of post-conceptual age. WGA = weeks of gestational age.

## Analysis performed across trials (meta-analysis)

The  applicant  has  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  controlled  trials  of  PDA  where  indomethacin  was randomised against ibuprofen in pre-term infants less than 37 weeks gestational age.  The infants were less than 28 days postnatal age and presented with an open PDA.  For inclusion, studies had to include short-term efficacy measured by echocardiography and rate of surgical ligation.

Six randomised comparative studies versus indomethacin were included in the meta-analysis; the two by Van Overmeire, 1997, 2000 and those by Lago et al., 2002, Patel et al., 2000, Pezzati et al., 1999, and  Mosca  et  al.,  1997.  Of  these  studies,  5  compared  indomethacin  with  ibuprofen-lysine  and  one compared indomethacin with Pedea. In each study the same dosing regimen of ibuprofen was used: 10mg/kg followed 24 hours later with 5mg/kg followed 24 hours later with another dose of 5mg/kg. All indomethacin studies used a loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg with subsequent doses of 0.1-0.25 mg/kg given 12-24 hourly.

The  PDA  closure  rate  was  75%  (168/223)  in  the  ibuprofen  group  and  73%  (150/206)  in  the indomethacin group. The Odds Ratio was 1.14 (95% CI 0.73 -1.77). The surgical ligation rate was 11.7%  (26/223)  in  the  ibuprofen  group  and  11.7%  (24/206)  in  the  indomethacin  group.  The corresponding Odds Ratio was 1.00 (95% CI 0.55 - 1.81). Mortality at 30 days was also evaluated although  it  was  only  reported  in  3  of  the  6  studies.  30-day  mortality  was  10.1%  (19/188)  in  the ibuprofen group and 9.1% (16/175) in the indomethacin group, ratio 1.11, CI 0.55-2.24.

The surgical  ligation  rate  was  26/223  (11.7%)  for  ibuprofen  and  24/206  for  indomethacin  (11.7%), relative risk 1.00, CI 0.55-1.81.

Reopening of the duct occurred in 5 cases for ibuprofen and 2 cases for indomethacin.

Similar response rates were obtained where curative and prophylactic ibuprofen was compared.

On the basis of the analysis it can be concluded that ibuprofen and indomethacin are equivalent with regard to ductal closure, requirement for surgical ligation, perinatal mortality.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Ibuprofen was developed as an alternative to indomethacin for PDA in the hope that it might be as effective with a better safety profile. The applicant has made good efforts in the generation of 'own data'.  Three  clinical  trials  have  been  conducted  one  addressing  bioequivalence  with  the  ibuprofen formulation usually used in the published literature. A second trial re-evaluated, and confirmed, the clinical  dose  regimen.  Finally,  a  sizable  trial  of  prophylactic  versus  as  needed  administration  of ibuprofen was carried out in premature neonates with PDA. Pharmacokinetic data were also generated in the two clinical studies.

In addition, bibliographic data are submitted to support the choice of dose of ibuprofen and the use of a new formulation and route of administration for a new therapeutic indication, which is based on the well characterised mechanism of action of ibuprofen, i.e. inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.

The published literature, together with  the applicant's own  generated  data, is  sufficient  to  fulfil the dossier requirements. In the light of an independent review of the literature on the use of ibuprofen for the  closure  of  PDA,  it  is  considered  that  the  applicant's  citation  of  the  literature  is  accurate  and complete.  The  published  studies  are  often  small,  however,  they  do  serve  to  provide  a  reasonable understanding of the effects of ibuprofen on blood-flow in various organs, and its clinical safety and efficacy.

It  is  considered that the normal dossier requirements are fully satisfied in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study IBU/PROPHYL/2000 has been well conducted, analysed, and presented. Technically, however, it  is  a  failed  study  in  that  it  was  stopped  for  safety  reasons  well  before  reaching  its  planned recruitment.

Indomethacin  is  an  established  treatment  for  pre-term  neonatal  patent  PDA  and  placebo-controlled trials are therefore no longer ethically possible. The lack of echocardiographic assessment at baseline might have been to avoid the ethical difficulties of not administering a known effective treatment as early as possible in a very high-risk population and was 'necessary' given the planned trial design. However, it raises two  problems. It  must  be  assumed  that  the  proportion  and  severity  of  PDA  was equivalent in the two treatment groups. This is likely in view of their similar gestational age but it is unsatisfactory to have to make an estimate about such an important variable.

The results of the primary analysis from Study IBU/PROPHYL/2000 suggest that prophylaxis is of some benefit in avoiding surgery. However, this did not confer a mortality benefit and appears to have resulted in more complications at least some of which may be treatment related. Prophylactic use of Pedea in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased incidence of renal failure and pulmonary adverse events including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary haemorrhage, as compared to curative use (see clinical safety). Pedea should therefore not be used prophylactically, which has been adequately addressed in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Neonatologists  first  investigated  intravenous  ibuprofen  for  the  treatment  and  prevention  of  PDA  in 1993. Subsequently only an intramuscular formulation of ibuprofen-lysine was available and this has been used in more recent trials administered intravenously. The applicant has chosen not to perform a comparative trial versus indomethacin but instead has chosen to perform a meta-analysis of existing studies.

Clearly a large prospective study comparing the efficacy and safety of Pedea to indomethacin would provide  the  highest  standard  of  evidence  to  make  a  decision  on  the  risk/benefit  of  Pedea  in  this indication. However, it is accepted that given the low prevalence of PDA it would take a long time to recruit sufficient infants to be able to show that Pedea was non-inferior to indomethacin.

The  bioequivalence  of  Pedea  (intravenous  ibuprofen)  to  Imbun  (ibuprofen-lysine  IM  formulation administered intravenously) for both R- and S-enantiomers in healthy volunteers has been shown and it  therefore seems appropriate to include studies using the ibuprofen-lysine formulation in the metaanalysis. The meta-analysis can be considered to provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety of ibuprofen.

Given the pharmacokinetic results showing bioequivalence between Pedea and Imbun it is reasonable to assume these results relate to the efficacy of Pedea even though only one of the studies used the Pedea formulation. These data are not however sufficient to provide robust evidence of equivalence or non-inferiority between Pedea and indomethacin. This is because the confidence intervals for the odds ratio  on  the  3  endpoints  listed  are  quite  wide.  However,  given the rarity of  PDA, these  data do  not provide any evidence that the efficacy of this formulation is any different to indomethacin.

The applicant's dose ranging study is limited and inadequate when taken on its own. However, when combined  with  the  more  impressive  published  data,  the  dose  ranging  study  is  consistent  with  the earlier studies and supports the choice of dose. This is the original regimen of 10-5-5 mg/kg described in the first study, by  Varvarigou  et al, 1996. The  dosing  interval is consistent with the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen in premature infants.

The  dose  ranging  study  showed  that  the  efficacy  of  the  initial  dose  of  10  mg/kg  and  15  mg/kg  is similar. The sequential design of this study is acceptable for a dose ranging study but it is questioned how a study of sample size only 20 could provide robust evidence of the dose response relationship of Pedea. From this study it remains possible that the efficacy of an initial dose of 15mg/kg is superior to an  initial  dose  of  10mg/kg.  The  applicant  states  that  renal  adverse  effects  are  slightly  higher  at  the 15mg/kg level and therefore the 10mg/kg dose is optimal. It is not clear from the data available which dose has the superior risk/benefit. The trade-off between potential increase in efficacy for the higher dose  and  associated  renal  toxicity  would  have  to  be  investigated  in  a  larger  group  of  neonates  to provide a clear evidence to decide which is the best dose. However, it is accepted that it would be difficult to conduct such a study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, in the light of the information available from the dose-ranging study and the meta-analysis, it is considered that evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the efficacy of an initial dose of 10mg/kg of Pedea. The limited pharmacokinetic data support the hypothesis that a higher dose would not be more effective in that successful closure did not correlate with plasma ibuprofen concentration. The failures cannot be attributed to an inadequate plasma concentration of ibuprofen.

A course of therapy is defined as three intravenous  doses  of  Pedea  given  at  24-hour  intervals.  The ibuprofen dose is adjusted to the body weight as follows:

- 1 st injection: 10 mg/kg,

- 2 nd and 3 rd injections: 5 mg/kg.

Before administration of Pedea an adequate echocardiographic examination should be performed in order to detect a haemodynamically significant PDA. If the DA does not close 48 hours after the last injection  or  if  it  re-opens,  a  second  course  of  3 doses,  as  above,  may  be  given.  If  the  condition  is unchanged after the second course of therapy, surgery of the patent DA may then be necessary.

However, based on the results from the dose-response study of Pedea in 40 preterm newborn infants, it is considered that sufficient information on efficacy in infants of 24-26 weeks of gestational age has not yet been provided.

The ductus  arteriosus closure  rate  associated  to  the  10-5-5  mg/kg  dose  regimen  was  75%  (6/8)  in neonates of 27-29 weeks' gestation and 33% (2/6) in neonates of 24-26 weeks' gestation.

A warning has therefore been introduced in Section 4.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics, stating that in preterm newborn infants less than 27 weeks of gestational age, the closure rate of the ductus arteriosus was shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen.

The applicant has committed to conduct a clinical study in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of  gestational  age  with  a  haemodynamically  significant  PAD in  order  to  evaluate  the  safety  and efficacy  of  Pedea.  Progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  CHMP  for  review  in  line  with  predefined timeframes.

## Clinical safety

The clinical safety documentation comprises the applicant's own data (in healthy adult volunteers and in the target population) and supportive data published in the literature.

## Patient exposure

Two pharmacokinetic trials involved a total of 30 adult volunteers.

In  the  target  population,  data  are  available  on  674  infants  all  &lt;35  weeks  gestational  age  treated  for PDA with the ibuprofen-lysine formulation and in 312 infants who received the Pedea formulation. Of  the  312  who  received  the  Pedea  formulation:  82  infants  of  23-28  weeks  gestational  age  were treated  curatively  with  Pedea  in  trials;  65  infants  of  24-27  weeks  gestational  age  were  treated prophylactically with Pedea in trials; 111 infants were treated curatively and 54 treated prophylactically with Pedea on a named patient basis where the data were collected retrospectively. Overall, the clinical safety documentation relates to 986 infants with PDA. Nearly all patients received the 10-5-5-mg/kg-dose regimen.

## Adverse events

Because of the nature of prematurity, nearly all reported adverse events are serious.

Furthermore,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  distinguish  between  drug  induced  and  disease  induced events. The applicant provided a review of clinical safety issues by organ, which is discussed below.

## Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths:

The death rates for ibuprofen lysine, where it was reported, usually at one month were 37/320 (12%) for ibuprofen used curatively and 95/533 (18%)  for ibuprofen used prophylactically. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

corresponding figures for indomethacin were 16-175 (9%) and 58/409 (14%) for control indomethacin or ibuprofen.

The  published  mortality  rates  range  from  5  -  15%  for  rescue  ibuprofen  and  from  0  -  28%  for prophylactic ibuprofen; the range for indomethacin  (prophylactic or rescue) was 3 - 29%. The death rate in the applicant's main clinical study was 28%.

## Cerebrovascular events:

The  incidence  of  grade  III-IV  intraventricular  haemorrhage  was  20/334  (6%)  for  ibuprofen  used curatively and 31/420 (7%) for ibuprofen used prophylactically.

The  corresponding  figures  for  indomethacin  were  13/178  (7%)  when  used  curatively  and  40/407 (10%) for indomethacin or curative ibuprofen used as control.

The event rate  for  grade  III  -  IV  intraventricular  haemorrhage  range  from  0  -  11  %  for  ibuprofen (prophylactic or rescue) and from 0 - 23% for indomethacin (prophylactic or rescue).  The rate in the applicant's main clinical study was 11% (prophylactic use).

Similarly, the range in the applicant's efficacy study for periventricular leukomalacia 9%, is within the published range (any treatment) of 3 - 11%.

The  table  below  shows  the  rates  for  'all  intraventricular  haemorrhage'  and  'grade  III  and  IV intraventricular haemorrhage' observed in trial IBU/PROPHYL/2000.

| IVH Grade   | Curative   | Prophylactic   |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 0           | 36 (54.4%) | 40 (61.5%)     |
| I           | 4 (6.1%)   | 4 (6.2%)       |
| II          | 11 (16.7%) | 14 (21.5%)     |
| III         | 10 (15.2%) | 7 (10.8%)      |
| IV          | 5 (7.6%)   | 0              |

## Gastrointestinal events:

Overall, the rates of necrotising enterocolitis and bowel perforation were 16/356 (4%) for ibuprofen and 12/198 (6%) for indomethacin used curatively.

The table below shows the rate of necrotising enterocolitis separately for all studies and all treatments. It should be noticed that the rate in the applicant's main study was 17% (prophylactic use), which is higher than might be expected. The published rates of   necrotising enterocolitis range from 5% to 11%.  Unfortunately, the only other study with a comparably high rate (Gonzales, 2000) is published only as an abstract and makes no comment on the issue. It is unclear whether bowel perforation is considered  as  a  separate  event  from  necrotising  enterocolitis.  The  applicant's  rate  8%  is  also  high since the published rates range from 0 - 5%.

## Renal dysfunction:

Many  of the studies examining renal function were conducted to investigate the potential pharmacodynamic  advantage  and  not  the  renal  safety  of  ibuprofen.  They  are  quite  small  and  are discussed in the pharmacodynamics section.

Two  reasonably  sized  studies  Van  Overmeire  et  al.,  2000  and  Lago  et  al.,  2002,  did  compare  the nephrotoxicity of the two compounds. In the publication by Van Overmeire, oliguria was observed in 7% of patients treated with ibuprofen and in 1% of those treated with indomethacin. The authors of both papers comment on the pharmacodynamic advantage for ibuprofen.

## Renal dysfunction by treatment

Results from four comparative trials with indomethacin suggested that indomethacin tended to reduce urine output and elevate serum creatinine for up to seven days. In three prophylactic trials there was no difference between the two treatments.

In the study by Rozé et al. of 60 neonates per group, ibuprofen was associated with a significant small decrease in urine output, decrease in urine sodium and increase in creatinine. In the large trial by Bray et  al.  of  an  open  cohort  of  pre-term  newborns  treated  prophylactically,  8  cases  out  of  111  had ibuprofen discontinued because of transient renal impairment. The applicant has plotted the incidence of oliguria, defined as urine output ≤ 1 ml/kg, for nine trials and suggests that for curative treatment the incidence was 19/343 (6%) for ibuprofen and 40/198 (20%) for indomethacin.

In  total,  oliguria  or  renal  failure  was  reported  in  13  of  199  patients  and  30  of  199  patients  had  a measured urine output of less than one mg/kg/hour.

## Haematological adverse events:

The published studies do not indicate any distinction between indomethacin and ibuprofen with regard to  bleeding  events  or  marrow  suppression.    In  the  prophylactic  study  conducted  by  the  applicant, neutropenia (&lt; 1500/mm 3 )  recorded  during  the  first  three  days  of  life  was  found  to  be  significantly more frequent for ibuprofen than for placebo (p &lt; 0.005).

## Respiratory adverse events:

As  indicated  in  the  efficacy  section  during  the  course  of  the  prophylactic  trial  of  Pedea,  three independent cases of refractory hypoxaemia with pulmonary hypertension were reported. These were acute  episodes  occurring  within  one  hour  of  the  first  infusion  while  patients  were  in  a  stable respiratory  condition  (FiO2  &lt; 40%).  Echocardiography showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow. Hypoxaemia was reversed in a few minutes by inhaled nitric oxide therapy. The events have been published (Lancet 2002).

In  total,  13.6  %  of  placebo  treated  patients  and  23.1%  of  ibuprofen  treated  patients  had  pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary haemorrhage.

In the study by Van Overmeire et al. there was a non-significant disadvantage for ibuprofen compared to indomethacin with regard to bronchopulmonary dysplasia: 53% and 39% of patients respectively. This disadvantage was not observed in the study by Lago et al. study.

The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, defined as oxygen dependence either at 28 days or at 36 weeks of post conceptional age, appears higher after ibuprofen than after indomethacin based on published  data.  When  used  curatively,  the  incidence  was  83/178  (47%)  for  ibuprofen  and  51/159 (32%) for indomethacin.

In  a  clinical  curative  trial  involving  175  preterm  newborn  infants  less  than  35  weeks  of  gestational age, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post-conceptional age was 13/81 (16%) for indomethacin versus 23/94 (24%) for ibuprofen.

## Potential toxicity of trometamol:

Trometamol  Tris  Hydroxymethyl  Amino-Methane  (THAM)  is  a  biologically  inert  amino  alcohol, which buffers carbon dioxide and acids in vitro and in vivo . It is considered as an alternative to sodium bicarbonate as a method of correcting acidosis. It is well tolerated at concentrations of 3 - 5 mmol/kg but has been shown at 8.8 mmol/kg to cause hypoglycaemia, respiratory depression, hypotension and nausea. It is also an irritant to veins and tissue but this may be more related to the pH at which it is administered rather than intrinsic toxicity.

## Pedea solution contains 0.03 mmol/ml of trometamol, used to solubilize the ibuprofen.

In one study, Gupta et al., 1967, where it was given as a 0.3 M solution at a dose of 1 ml/kg, it was not associated with an increase in arterial oxygen tension.  In a second study, the same group found that oxygen tension increased in 7 cases was unchanged in 10 and fell in one case (Van Vliet and Gupta, 1973.)  A third study by Baum and Robertson, 1975, found that a hypertonic solution of 0.58 M over 30 s  caused  an  initial  fall  in  arterial  PO 2 in  5/6  infants  with  respiratory  distress  syndrome.    Other adverse events associated with THAM were attributable to the infusion of a hyperosmolar solution.

Intravenous  administration  of  trometamol  in  the  treatment  of  acidaemia  produces  an  increase  in arterial pH. After administration of high doses (20 gm; ~300 mg/kg) a decrease in minute volume has been observed. Although this leads to alveolar hypoventilation and consequently arterial hypoxaemia, the primary event is depression of the respiratory centre by the alkaline arterial pH.

However, the normal buffering capacity of blood is not affected until the concentration of trometamol reaches  &gt;50  mmol/l,  which  is  vastly  in  excess  of  the  concentration  that  could  be  achieved  in therapeutic use of Ibuprofen i.v. It is therefore unlikely that the instances of hypoxia observed in the clinical trials relate to the trometamol in the formulation, particularly as decreased pulmonary blood flow and not respiratory depression was apparently the cause of the adverse events.

Intravenous  administration  of  trometamol  has  been  used  clinically  for  the  treatment  of  metabolic acidosis for many years (Brinkman et al., 1960, Nahas et al., 1963) and is administered intravenously as a 0.3M solution, which is isomolar with plasma and ten times more concentrated than the Ibuprofen i.v. formulation (Nahas et al., 1963, Nahas et al., 1998). It has also been used in the treatment of infant respiratory distress syndrome and taking account of the lower glomerular filtration rate in neonates it is  recommended  that  the  dose  is  reduced  to  5  -7  mmol/kg/day,  more  than  80  times  the  dose  (0.06 mmol/kg) which will be administered with this formulation.

The  content  of  trometamol  is  0.06  mmol/ampoule  and  with  a  full  treatment  a  1.5  kg  infant  would receive 0.24 mmol.  The  literature contains reports of organ necrosis in neonates following administration  via  the  umbilical  vessels  at  doses  of  3.6  to  108  mmol  and  in  adults  at  45  mmol following intravenous administration. The applicant points out that these concentrations are 15 times those in Pedea.

## Laboratory findings:

Other than the raw data from studies IBU/PROPHYL/2000 and IBU/99/DOSRANGE the applicant does  not  present  any  information  on  laboratory  findings. However, this  omission  is  acceptable,  the unwanted effects of ibuprofen are well known and are adequately addressed in the SPC.

The  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  was  low  and  not  increased  for  those  treated  with  ibuprofen compared to indomethacin. Neutropenia, &lt;1500/mm 3 , was significantly more common during the first three days of life with ibuprofen that placebo when preterm newborns were treated prophylactically. This may be a true finding, as a transient white count fall was associated with ibuprofen in 8 out of 55,785  children  aged  6  months  to  12  years  in  a  trial  using  paracetamol  as  control,  Lesko  et  al., 1995.The applicant has not investigated the potential for the bleeding time to increase when ibuprofen is combined with nitric oxide therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The applicant indicates that in 12 of 174 infants treatment was stopped due to adverse events. This includes  4  of  66  in  the  placebo  treated  arm  of  IBU/PROPHYL/2000.  In  ten  cases  the  narrative suggests a rapid global deterioration in clinical condition and a decision not to further treat a dying infant.

## Safety in special populations

No  data  I  special  populations  are  presented.  However  given  the  intended  use  this  is  considered acceptable.

## Immunological events

There is no evidence that ibuprofen has effects on the immune system, other than perhaps occasionally and indirectly through marrow suppression.

## Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported with intravenous ibuprofen in preterm newborn infants.

However,  overdose  has  been  described  in  infants  and  children  administered  oral  ibuprofen:  CNS depression, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbances, bradycardia, hypotension, apnoea, abnormal renal function, haematuria have been observed.

Massive  overdose  (up  to  more  than  1000  mg/kg)  has  been  reported  to  induce  coma,  metabolic acidosis,  and  transient  renal  failure.  All  patients  recovered  with  conventional  treatment.  Only  one recorded death has been published: after an overdose of 469 mg/kg, a 16-month old child developed an apnoeic episode with seizures and fatal aspiration pneumonia.

The management of ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive.

Adequate information has been included in section 4.9 of the SPC.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The applicant has not carried out any specific interaction studies, relying only on the clinical trial data, where concomitant medication is common. Neonatal intensive care is a complex situation with high morbidity and mortality where drug interactions may not be obvious. Adequate information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC (see clinical pharmacology).

## Post-marketing experience

Since Pedea was made available on a named-patient basis, 737 boxes of 4 ampoules were provided in 2001  and  1,696  boxes  in  2002.  The  product  has  been  used  in  the  following  European  countries: Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Two serious adverse events were reported during this 2-year period. One was progressive hypoxaemia following the third infusion of ibuprofen on Day 6 of an infant, gestational age 26 weeks. There  was  progressive  recovery  with  nitric  oxide  and  high  frequency  ventilation  and  minor echocardiographic  signs  of  pulmonary  hypertension  24  hours  later.    The  second  infant  had  a pulmonary  haemorrhage  and  cardiac  dysfunction  after  two  doses  on  the  second  day  of  life  and recovered with high frequency ventilation.

In  addition,  following  the  occurrence  of  three  cases  of  reversible  refractory  hypoxaemia  after prophylactic therapy in the clinical trial, a retrospective survey was undertaken by the applicant to add data about the safety of ibuprofen administration in preterm infants.

This included 165 preterm infants, approximately half below 27 weeks of gestational age. No cases of Pedea  associated  hypoxaemia  were  reported,  although,  as  may  be  expected  from  their  prematurity, major  complications  were  common.    In  the  late  treatment  group  the  incidence  of  complications appeared similar in the 62 infants treated with ibuprofen and the 65 treated with indomethacin.  Unlike indomethacin, ibuprofen was not associated with water retention and hyponatraemia, or an increase in serum creatinine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on clinical safety

Ibuprofen was developed as an alternative to indomethacin for PDA in the hope that it might be as effective with a better safety profile. The applicant has made good efforts in the generation of 'own data'. Three clinical trials have been conducted.

In addition, bibliographic data are submitted to support the choice of dose of ibuprofen and the use of a new formulation and route of administration for a new therapeutic indication, which is based on the well characterised mechanism of action of ibuprofen.

The published literature, together with  the applicant's own  generated  data, is  sufficient  to  fulfil the dossier requirements. In the light of an independent review of the literature on the use of ibuprofen for the  closure  of  PDA,  it  is  considered  that  the  applicant's  citation  of  the  literature  is  accurate  and complete.  The  published  studies  are  often  small,  however,  they  do  serve  to  provide  a  reasonable understanding of the effects of ibuprofen on blood-flow in various organs, and its clinical safety and efficacy.

It  is  considered  that  the  normal  dossier  requirements  are  satisfied  in  accordance  with  Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

Evaluation of the safety of ibuprofen in the treatment of PDA, and particularly the safety relative to indomethacin is difficult due to the high background rate of mortality and morbidity in the treatment population and due to the small database. Moreover, the nature of the data, much of it in the form of published literature where safety information is not usually emphasised, adds to the difficulty.

Pedea  is  very  likely  to  be  associated  with  all  the  unwanted  effects  known  from  adult  patients. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say whether there will be additional problems due to the fragility of the treatment population in this indication.

Indomethacin has an established positive benefit/risk for PDA when compared to placebo.  The safety profile of ibuprofen seems to compare favourably with indomethacin and therefore appears acceptable for PDA, although the cause of adverse events in preterm neonates is complex.

It  is  possible  that  ibuprofen  may  be  less  detrimental  to  cerebral  blood  flow  when  compared  to indomethacin.  It is also possible that occasional cases of acute hypoxia shortly after infusion might be more common with ibuprofen than with indomethacin.

However, there appears to be sufficient data available from animal studies to support the hypothesis that  the  adverse  events  in  the  clinical  trial  relate  to  the  extreme  prematurity  of  the  babies  and administration in the first hours after birth.

In  the  absence  of  a  direct  head-to-head  comparative  trial  versus  indomethacin,  the  applicant  has provided data supporting the efficacy of ibuprofen in PDA closure.

From the extensive clinical trials meta-analysis it emerges that the rate of closure of PDA achieved with  ibuprofen  is  similar  to  that  expected  with  equivalent  use  of  indomethacin.  Both  compounds results in considerably lower rates of PDA at whatever time point the assessment is made. However, this  does  not  seem  to  confer  a  benefit  with  respect  to  overall  survival  or  the  frequency  of intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and renal impairment.  It  seems  probable  that  the  database  is  too  small  to  show  anything  other  than  a  major difference in any of those clinical events.

Indomethacin has been used for almost three decades in the prophylaxis and treatment of PDA. The applicant considers that ibuprofen has similar efficacy and a better safety profile than indomethacin; the  latter  through  less  disturbance  in  systemic  blood  flow  and  reduction  in  some  common  clinical complications of prematurity.

However,  the  quality  of  the  publications  supporting  the  contention  that  ibuprofen  is  safer  than indomethacin is not impressive. It is acknowledged that there are ethical and technical reasons, which make  it  very  difficult  to  conduct  clinical  trials  in  premature  neonates.  However,  only  four  papers involved a direct comparison and only one was double blind. Despite these limitations the literature is consistent  in  showing  that  there  are  differences  in  haemodynamics  following  intervention  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ibuprofen  and  indomethacin,  the  former  causing  less  disturbance.  If  the  clinical  complications  of prematurity,  intraventricular  haemorrhage,  mesenteric  ischaemia  etc.  relate  in  part  to  NSAID intervention  as  distinct  from  closure  of  PDA,  then  ibuprofen  could  offer  a  safety  advantage  related possibly to a lesser impact on systemic haemodynamics.

Of  some  concern  are  the  three  cases  of  hypoxaemia  in  the  prophylactic  trial  in  patients  who  were stable  before  Pedea was injected.  As this had not  been reported with ibuprofen lysine, there is the possibility that an excipient may have contributed.  The main reassurance from the published data with THAM (Tris buffer, or trometamol) infusions in neonates is that hypoxaemia was uncommon with infusions of 0.3 mmol/ml, equivalent to 100 ampoules/kg of Pedea. This appears to be a reassuring safety margin for the excipient trometamol in Pedea where it is used as a solubilising agent.  The cases of  hypoxaemia  may  have  been  detected  by  more  careful  monitoring  than  in  earlier  trials.    One explanation  might  be  that  in  some  neonates  endogenous  prostanoids  are  important  in  maintaining pulmonary vascular patency.

The phenomenon of pulmonary hypertension has not been reported in trials with ibuprofen lysine used to cure PDA, although there are three cases reported with indomethacin.  It is possible Pedea has a product  specific  side  effect,  although  the  applicant  appears  to  have  excluded  the  possibility  of precipitation/embolisation.

Some  infants  may  be  dependent  on  prostanoids  to  maintain  normal  patency  of  the  pulmonary circulation, a deficiency of which can be compensated for with nitric oxide. This raises the possibility that nitric oxide might contribute to the unwanted patency of PDA.

In the bibliographic review respiratory outcome appears similar for ibuprofen and indomethacin.  In contrast, the prophylactic trial with Pedea showed a trend for an increase in the use of inhaled nitric oxide and high frequency ventilation.

With regards to the reported adverse events for ibuprofen in the clinical trials, the extreme prematurity of preterm newborns, and the variability involved with such a fragile population and the possibility of a  role  for  underlying  conditions,  means  that  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  whether  haemodynamic consequences may or may not be treatment-related. All adverse events in this population are viewed as serious,  but  this  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  the  clinical  condition,  and  the  specialist situations and knowledge attached to clinical treatment administration.

Before administration of Pedea an adequate echocardiographic examination should be performed in order  to  detect  a  haemodynamically  significant  PDA  and  to  exclude  pulmonary  hypertension  and ductal-dependent  congenital  heart  disease.  Pedea  is  contraindicated  in  congenital  heart  disease  in which  patency  of  the  DA is  necessary  for  satisfactory  pulmonary  or  systemic  blood  flow  (e.g. pulmonary atresia, severe tetralogy of Fallot, severe coarctation of the aorta).

The results of the primary analysis from Study IBU/PROPHYL/2000 suggest that prophylaxis is of some benefit in avoiding surgery. However, this did not confer a mortality benefit and appears to have resulted in more complications at least some of which may be treatment related. Prophylactic use of Pedea in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased incidence of renal failure and pulmonary adverse events including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary haemorrhage, as compared to curative use. In particular, severe hypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension was reported in 3 infants within one hour of the first infusion and was reversed within 30 min after start of inhaled nitric oxide therapy.

Pedea  should  therefore  not  be  used  prophylactically,  which  has  been  adequately  addressed  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics. Further, Pedea is also contraindicated in infants with significant impairment of renal function.

Since ibuprofen was shown in vitro to displace bilirubin from its binding site to albumin, the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborn infants may be increased. Therefore, ibuprofen should not be used in infants with marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  a  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID),  ibuprofen  may  mask  the  usual  signs  and symptoms of infection. Pedea must therefore be used cautiously in the presence of an infection.

As ibuprofen may inhibit platelet aggregation, premature neonates should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consequently, Pedea is contraindicated in infants with active bleeding, especially intracranial  or  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  and  in  infants  with  thrombocytopenia  or  coagulation defects. Careful monitoring of both renal and gastrointestinal function is recommended.

Adequate information has been included in sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SPC.

Sufficient  information  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Pedea  in  the  younger  cohort  of  patients (&lt;27 weeks of gestational age) has not yet been provided. A warning has therefore been introduced in Section 4.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics, stating that in preterm newborn infants less than 27 weeks of gestational age, the closure rate of the ductus arteriosus was shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen.

The applicant has therefore committed to conduct a clinical study in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age with a haemodynamically significant PAD in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pedea. Progress reports will be submitted to CHMP for review in line with predefined timeframes.

Furthermore,  the  applicant  has  committed  to  initiate  a  Post-Marketing  Surveillance  Programme designed to record neurological/ sensorial and pulmonary outcomes at 18 months of corrected age in a group of preterm infants treated with Pedea in the neonatal period.

## 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The pharmacodynamic profile of ibuprofen has been extensively characterised. The  known pharmacokinetic profile of ibuprofen, along with the superiority of clinical pharmacokinetic data in neonates negates the requirement to conduct further investigations in animals.

In  consideration  of  the  proposed  indication  and  patient  population,  and  in  the  light  of  clinical  data gathered  from  over  1000  preterm  newborns,  the  toxicity  profile  of  ibuprofen  is  acceptable  for  the current indication. All non-clinical data considered relevant to clinical safety have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pedea.

## Efficacy

Ibuprofen is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, leading to reduce synthesis of prostaglandins.  Since  prostaglandins  are  involved  in  the  persistence  of  the ductus  arteriosus after birth, this effect is believed to be the main mechanism of action of ibuprofen in this indication.

In a dose-response study of Pedea in 40 preterm newborn infants, the ductus arteriosus closure rate associated to the 10-5-5 mg/kg dose regimen was 75% (6/8) in neonates of 27-29 weeks' gestation and 33% (2/6) in neonates of 24-26 weeks' gestation.

The applicant's studies and the meta-analysis of the published clinical studies suggest that ibuprofen is efficacious  in  this  condition.    This  is  in  keeping  with  the  known  pharmacology  of  cyclooxygenase inhibition  and  its  effect  on  PDA.    It  is  likely  that  the  dose  chosen  for  ibuprofen  is  appropriate, although the results from the small numbers recruited into the applicant's dose ranging study add little to the published literature. However, a warning has therefore been introduced in the SPC, stating that in  preterm  newborn  infants  less  than  27  weeks  of  gestational  age,  the  closure  rate  of  the ductus arteriosus was shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety

Data  are  currently  available  on  approximately  1,000  preterm  newborn  from  both  literature  with ibuprofen and clinical trials with Pedea.

Indomethacin has an established positive benefit/risk for PDA when compared to placebo.  The safety profile  of  ibuprofen  seems  to  compare  favourably  with  indomethacin  due  to  a  lesser  effect  on  the systemic blood flow. However, causality of adverse events in preterm neonates are difficult to assess since  they  may  be  related  to  the  haemodynamic  consequences  of  the  PDA  as  well  as  to  the  direct effects of ibuprofen.

Before administration of Pedea an adequate echocardiographic examination should be performed in order  to  detect  a  haemodynamically  significant  PDA  and  to  exclude  pulmonary  hypertension  and ductal-dependent  congenital  heart  disease.  Pedea  is  contraindicated  in  congenital  heart  disease  in which patency of the DA is necessary for satisfactory pulmonary or systemic blood flow.

Since prophylactic use in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn infants  less  than  28 weeks  of  gestational  age  was  associated  with  increased  pulmonary  and  renal adverse events, Pedea should not be used prophylactically. Further, Pedea is also contraindicated in infants with significant impairment of renal function.

As ibuprofen may inhibit platelet aggregation, premature neonates should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consequently, Pedea is contraindicated in infants with active bleeding, especially intracranial  or  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  and  in  infants  with  thrombocytopenia  or  coagulation defects. Careful monitoring of both renal and gastrointestinal function is recommended.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Following the review of the submitted documentation, and the final SPC and letter of undertaking, the CPMP agreed that efficacy has been shown that is clinically relevant and the safety profile of Pedea is in  line  with  the  results  described  in  the  literature,  which  allow  a  conclusion  on  an  acceptable benefit/risk for the treatment of a haemodynamically significant PDA in preterm newborn infants less than  34  weeks  of  gestational  age.  However,  in  preterm  newborn  infants  less  than  27  weeks  of gestational age, the closure rate of the ductus arteriosus was  shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen.

The applicant has therefore committed to conduct a clinical study in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age with a haemodynamically significant PDA in order to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pedea.

Since  prophylactic  use  in  preterm  newborn  infants  less  than  28 weeks  of  gestational  age  was associated with an increased frequency of adverse events, the risk/benefit may be considered adverse if ibuprofen is used prophylactically.

Furthermore,  the  applicant  has  committed  to  initiate  a  Post-Marketing  Surveillance  Programme designed to record neurological/ sensorial and pulmonary outcomes at 18 months of corrected age in a group of preterm infants treated with Pedea in the neonatal period.

## Recommendation

'Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Pedea in the treatment of a haemodynamically significant PDA in  preterm  newborn  infants  less  than  34  weeks  of  gestational  age  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.'
