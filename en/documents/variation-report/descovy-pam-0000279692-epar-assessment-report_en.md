## 1. Introduction

On 10 June 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Descovy, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the GS-US-311-1269 - A Phase 2/3, Open-Label, Multi-Cohort Switch Study to Evaluate  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  Alafenamide  (F/TAF)  in  HIV-1  Infected  Children  and  Adolescents Virologically Suppressed on a Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF)-Containing Regimen is a stand-alone study.

This submission provides safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy data from the final analysis of the Phase 2/3 study GS-US-311-1269 on the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of F/TAF in virologically suppressed  children  and  adolescents  with  HIV-1  in  fulfilment  of  the  requirements  of  Article 46  of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The pharmaceutical formulation used in the study was tablets.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- GS-US-311-1269 -A Phase 2/3, Open-Label, Multi-Cohort Switch Study to Evaluate Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1 Infected Children and Adolescents Virologically Suppressed on a Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF)-Containing Regimen.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

GS-US-311-1269 - A Phase 2/3, Open-Label, Multi-Cohort Switch Study to Evaluate  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir  Alafenamide  (F/TAF)  in  HIV-1  Infected Children and Adolescents Virologically Suppressed on a Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF)-Containing Regimen

## Description

The study GS-US-311-1269 was a Phase 2/3, open label, multicohort switch study to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of F/TAF in adolescents (≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age) and children (≥ 1 month to &lt; 12 years of age) with HIV -1 who were virologically suppressed (HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL for at least 6 consecutive months) while on a stable 2-NRTI-containing regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The initial protocol envisaged that 4 cohorts would be included in the study, Cohorts 1 and 2, as detailed below, and Cohorts 3 (participants ≥ 2 to &lt; 6 years of age unable to swallow a tablet) and 4 (participants ≥ 1 month to &lt; 2 years of age). While Cohort 1 was fully enrolled (planned N = 25 participants minimum; participants enrolled N = 29), enrolment was halted prior to full enrolment of Cohort 2 (Group 1: planned N = 16, enrolled N = 9; Group 2: planned N = 17, enrolled N = 3) when F/TAF became the required 2 N(t)RTI backbone in the Tybost ®  study GS-US-2160128, to which already enrolled participants in Cohort 2 were allowed to transfer if they wished. Cohorts 3 and 4 were incorporated into Study GS-US-2160128 and no participant was enrolled in either cohort in Study GS-US-311-1269.

## Methods

## Study participants

Eligible  participants  were  male  or  female  adolescents  and  children  with  HIV-1  on  a  stable  2-NRTIcontaining regimen that included a third ARV agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening.

Body weight and age at screening for both cohorts were as follows:

| Cohort                                              | Age Range                | Weight             |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 一                                                   | ≥ 12 years to < 18 years | ≥ 35 kg            |
| 2 (Group 1)                                         | ≥6 years to < 12 years   | ≥ 25 kg            |
| 2 (Group 2) (participants able to swallow a tablet) | ≥ 2 years to < 12 years  | ≥ 17 kg to < 25 kg |

Participants  should  have  had  no  documented  or  suspected  resistance  to  TFV  or  FTC,  no  laboratory evidence of current active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 consecutive months and an estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Schwartz formula (eGFRSchwartz ) of ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

## Treatments

F/TAF tablets in combination with a third ARV agent, and with or without food (as determined by the third ARV agent), were administered orally once daily for at least 48 weeks as follows:

| Cohort                                             | Age and Body Weight                | F/TAF Dose (mg) With Third Agent                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                    | ≥ 12 to < 18 years, ≥ 35 kg        | 200/25 with unboosted third agent 200/10 with boosted third agent |
| 2. Group 1                                         | ≥6 to < 12 years, ≥ 25 kg          | 200/25                                                            |
| 2, Group 2 (participants able to swallow a tablet) | ≥ 2 to < 12 years, ≥ 17 to < 25 kg | 120/15                                                            |

## Objective(s)

## Primary Objectives

- To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and confirm the TAF dose in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents virologically suppressed  on a 2-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimen

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) through Week 24

## Secondary Objectives

- To evaluate the PK of TFV and emtricitabine (FTC)
- To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of F/TAF through Week 48

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoints

- The PK parameter AUCtau for TAF and tenofovir (TFV)
- Incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) and all treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) through Week 24

## Secondary Endpoints

- PK parameters of Cmax, Clast , CL/F, and V z/F for TAF; AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau for FTC and TFV
- Incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs and all treatmentemergent AEs through Week 48
- The percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-defined snapshot algorithm
- The change from baseline in CD4 cell count (cells/μL) and CD4 percentage at Weeks 24 and 48
- The palatability and acceptability of the age-appropriate F/TAF formulation

## Sample size

A minimum of 58 participants were planned to be enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

In the original protocol participants included in Cohort 2 were to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to switch their current 2-NRTI (TDF-containing) regimen  to either open-label F/TAF or retain open-label emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) while continuing their 3 rd ARV agent through 96 weeks. With the F/TAF approval in adolescents, the protocol was amended and all subjects enrolled into Cohort 2 received F/TAF (amendment 2, dated 02 August 2017).

Blinding is not applicable as this is an open-label study.

## Statistical Methods

## Efficacy:

Analyses of all efficacy endpoints used the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which included all participants enrolled in the study who had received ≥ 1 dose of study drug.

The numbers and percentages of participants with HIV1  RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined by the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm were summarized by cohort and group. The 95% CIs for the point estimates were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson Exact method. Virologic response was also analysed using the missing = failure (M = F) and missing = excluded (M = E) methods for imputing missing HIV-1 RNA values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The change from baseline in CD4 cell count (cells/μL) and CD4% was summarized by visit, cohort, and group using descriptive statistics.

## Pharmacokinetics:

A by-participant listing for tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in available peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) PK samples was presented. All other analyses related to IPK and sparse PK were completed in Interim Analysis 2.

## Safety:

The Safety Analysis Set included all participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. All safety data from the first dose date up to 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug were summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety data collected were listed for all enrolled participants.

Adverse event and clinical laboratory data were summarized using descriptive statistics by cohort, group, and overall. Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 27.1.

Bone and renal safety laboratory data were summarized.

Body weight, body weight Z-score, body height, body height Z-score, body mass index (BMI), and BMI Zscore were summarized.

Percentage changes from baseline in spine and total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral density (BMD) was summarized by visit.

## Other:

Palatability  and  acceptability  assessments  were  summarized  by  visit  using  frequency  count  and percentage.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of 49 participants screened, 41 were enrolled, of whom 40 received study drug; 1 participant was enrolled in error and never received study drug. (The total number of participants screened was reported as 50 in the Interim Analysis 2 CSR; it was later confirmed that 1 screen failure participant had subsequently failed rescreening at a different site but had erroneously been recorded as a separate individual).

Overall, 92.5% (37 of 40) treated participants completed study drug in the main (48 -week treatment) phase and entered the extension phase (Cohort 1: 28 of 28 participants; Cohort 2 Group 1: 7 of 9 participants; Cohort 2 Group 2: 2 of 3 participants). Three participants (7.5%) prematurely discontinued study drug in the main phase: 2 participants in Cohort 2 Group 1 due to investigator's discretion and 1 participant in Cohort 2 Group 2 withdrew consent.

Of the 37 participants who entered the extension phase, 17 (45.9%) participants completed study drug (Cohort 1: 10 participants; Cohort 2 Group 1: 5 participants; Cohort 2 Group 2: 2  participants) and 20 participants  (54.1%)  prematurely  discontinued  study  drug.  In  Cohort  1, 14  participants  prematurely discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, 2 due to noncompliance with study drug, 1 was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lost to follow-up, and 1 participant prematurely discontinued due to pregnancy. In Cohort 2 Group 1, 1 participant prematurely discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion and 1 was lost to followup.

## Recruitment

Participants  were enrolled at 8 study  centres:  4  in  the  United  States  (US),  3  in  South  Africa,  and  1  in Panama.

## Baseline data

For participants in Cohort 1, the median age (range) was 14 (12 to 17) years. Most participants were male (57.1%), and either Black or Other race (42.9% each). Fifty percent of participants were Hispanic or Latino. Median (first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3]) baseline body weight and body weight Zscore were 45.3 (40.0, 51.0) kg and -0.91 (1.57, -0.15), respectively; median (Q1, Q3) baseline height and height Z-score were 152.8 (145.7, 162.0) cm and -1.39 (1.95, -0.49), respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline BMI and BMI Z-score were 18.6 (17.5, 20.7) kg/m 2 and -0.24 (-0.92, 0.48), respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) body surface area (BSA) was 1.39 (1.29, 1.49) m 2 . Tanner stages for genitalia at baseline for males were generally evenly distributed through Stages 1 to 4 (25.0%, 18.8%, 25.0%, and 25.0% participants, respectively). For females, Tanner  stages  for  breasts  were  Stages  1,  3,  4,  and  5 (9.1%,  36.4%,  45.5%,  and  9.1%  participants, respectively). The Tanner stage evaluation for breasts was missing for 1 female participant.

For participants in Cohort 2 Group 1, the median age (range) was 10 (8 to 11) years. Most participants were female (55.6%), all were either Black or Other race (44.4% and 55.6%, respectively), and most were Hispanic or Latino (55.6%).

The  study  enrolled  children  and  adolescents  with  HIV-1  who  were  virologically  suppressed,  thus,  all participants, except for 1 participant in Cohort 1, had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL. The overall median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4 cell count was 911 (735, 1098) cells/μL (Cohort 1: 908 [735, 988] cells/μL; Cohort 2 Group 1: 910 [689, 1133] cells/μL; Cohort 2 Group 2: 1052 [1013, 1562] cells/μL), with 95.0% of participants overall (Cohort 1: 96.4%; Cohort 2 Group 1: 88.9%; Cohort 2 Group 2: 100.0%) ha ving a baseline CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/μL. The overall median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4% was 37.1% (32.2%, 39.0%) (Cohort 1: 36.7% [31.8%, 39.2%]; Cohort 2 Group 1: 37.2% [33.6%, 38.6%]; Cohort 2 Group 2: 37.2% [32.3%, 38.7%]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median (Q1, Q3) number of years since diagnosis of HIV-1 infection was 12.0 (9.0, 13.0) years for participants in Cohort 1; 9.0 (6.0, 10.0) years for participants in Cohort 2 Group 1; and 8.0 (5.0, 8.0) years for  participants  in  Cohort  2  Group  2.  The  most  common  mode  of  infection  in  all  cohorts  was  vertical transmission (Cohort 1, 85.7%; Cohort 2 Group 1, 100.0%; and Cohort 2 Group 2, 100.0%). At baseline, 100.0% of participants in both cohorts were asymptomatic, and none had a historical diagnosis of AIDS.

No participant tested positive for HBV surface antigen or HCV antibody.

Median  (Q1,  Q3)  values  for  baseline  eGFRSchwartz were  as  follows:  Cohort  1:  157.3  (138.6, 191.5) mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; Cohort 2 Group 1: 172.7 (144.5, 180.0) mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; Cohort 2 Group 2: 155.3 (135.3, 169.0) mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

In  accordance  with  study  eligibility  criteria,  all  participants  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  received  a  regimen containing 2 NRTIs in combination with a third agent prior to the screening visit. Among third agents, the majority of participants received lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (57.5%) or EFV (30.0%).

No participants  discontinued  study  drug  or  the  study  due  to  COVID-19  pandemic-related  matters.  No participant  missed  study  visits  or  had  virtual  study  visits  due  to  restrictions  related  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical  virology  data  for  Study  GS-US-311-1269  (Cohort 1  and  Cohort 2  Groups 1  and 2)  was  also presented.  Virology  analyses  were  conducted,  inclusive  of  all  data  through  the  end  of  the  study  for participants in Cohort 1 (median exposure 306.5 weeks), Cohort 2 Group 1 (median exposure 145.1 weeks), and Cohort 2 Group 2 (median exposure 100.7 weeks).

## Cohort 1

Of the 28 participants enrolled and treated in Cohort 1, 6 participants (21.4%) met the criteria for inclusion in the Resistance Analysis Population (RAP) and had their virus analysed for resistance. At the time of virologic  failure  (VF),  4  participants  (66.7%)  were  receiving  efavirenz  (EFV)  as  their  third  agent; 1 participant (16.7% was receiving dolutegravir (DTG); and 1 participant (16.7%) was receiving ritonavir -boosted atazanavir (ATV/r). Of the 4 participants who had VF while receiving EFV, 3 participants switched their third agent (2 to ATV/r; 1 to DTG) and had VF on their new regimen.

The following nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and NRTI resistance mutations were found:

## NNRTI

- K103N (4 participants [66.7%])
- Y181C (1 participant [16.7%])
- Y188C/L (2 participants [33.3%])
- V106M (1 participant [16.7%])
- K101E (1 participant [16.7%])

## NRTI

- K65R (2 participants [33.3%])
- M184V (1 participant [16.7%])
- K219K/N (1 participant [16.7%])

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- D67N (1 participant [16.7%])

The K219K/N and D67N mutations are presumed to be transmitted drug resistance as these mutations do not emerge due to tenofovir (TFV) treatment, but no participant in Cohort 1 had a baseline sample or historical genotype available for analysis.

## Cohort 2

For the purposes of the virology study report, participants in Cohort 2 Groups 1 and 2 were combined.

Of the 12 participants enrolled in Cohort 2, 1 participant (8.3%) met the criteria for inclusion in the RAP and had their virus analysed for resistance. At the time of VF, this participant was receiving ritonavirboosted lopinavir as their third agent and had no resistance mutation to any study drug. No preexisting protease (PR)/reverse transcriptase (RT), or integrase (IN) substitution was detected in the baseline sample for this participant.

Altogether, baseline samples were available for 9 of 12 participants (75%) in Cohort 2, and the following preexisting primary NNRTI, NRTI, and IN resistance mutations were found:

- NNRTI
- -K103K/N/R/S (1 participant [8.3%])
- -Y181Y/C (2 participants [16.7%])
- -Y188Y/C (1 participant [8.3%])
- NRTI
- -M184M/V (1 participant [8.3%])
- Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)
- -G140G/R (1 participant [8.3%])

## Metabolic Laboratory Parameters

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median fasting values for total cholesterol, direct  lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  high -density lipoprotein  (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, or glucose for either cohort.

Graded abnormalities were reported for the following:

- Increased fasting total cholesterol: 28.2%, 11 of 39 participants (9 in Cohort 1 and 2 in Cohort 2 Group 1)
- Increased fasting LDL cholesterol: 28.2%, 11 of 39 participants (9 in Cohort 1 and 2 in Cohort 2 Group 1)
- Increased fasting triglycerides: 5.1%, 2 of 39 participants (1 in Cohort 1 and 1 in Cohort 2 Group 1)
- Increased glucose (fasting hyperglycaemia ): 15.0%, 6 of 40 participants (all in Cohort 1)
- Decreased glucose (fasting hypoglycaemia ); 10.0%, 4 of 40 participants (3 in Cohort 1 and 1 in Cohort 2 Group 2)

All graded fasting lipid and glucose abnormalities were Grade 1 and 2 with the exception of 1 abnormality of Grade 3 increased triglycerides (Cohort 1) and 3 abnormalities of Grade 3 increased LDL (2 in Cohort 1 and 1 in Cohort 2 Group 1).

## Vital Signs and Tanner Stage

There were no clinically relevant changes in any vital signs parameter in any participant during the study. Changes in Tanner stage was consistent with the maturing study population.

## Pregnancy

One participant in Cohort 1 became pregnant during the study.

## Other Results:

## Palatability and Acceptability Assessments

No participant in either cohort reported dissatisfaction with the palatability of F/TAF tablets at Week 2 or during the IPK visit. No participant in either cohort reported dissatisfaction with the acceptability of F/TAF tablets in terms of shape and size and swallowing.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The high degree of virologic suppression maintained in paediatric participants who switched their previous ARV regimen to include F/TAF provides reassurance of the efficacy of F/TAF as a 2 NRTI 'backbone' in combination with a third ARV agent in the treatment of HIV1 infection in this population. The data provided demonstrate a favourable safety profile  with  no  new  clinically  relevant  safety  signals  being  identified following the long-term administration of F/TAF. Particularly, there were no safety concerns in relation to bone and renal parameters.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The applicant reported the findings from the paediatric study GS-US-311-1269, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of F/TAF in the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adolescents and children. The benefitrisk profile for this paediatric population is considered positive, and no changes to the Descovy EU product

information  are  deemed  necessary.  The  longer-term  data  from  the  study  continue  to  support  these findings. There were no safety concerns related to bone and renal parameters.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
