| II/0089   | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to revise the infusion rate for RA patients and update the information on infusion reactions. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Amendments to the text of the patient alert card in the PL following completion of readability tests assessed as part of the follow up measure MEA071 were implemented. The updated RMP version 9.4 was also submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/04/2014 | 23/05/2014 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Study ML25641 demonstrated the safety of a 120 minute infusion schedule is adequate and have not demonstrated any unexpected events. The risks of administering rituximab are well characterized and the risk associated with administering faster infusions of rituximab were similar to or lower than the corresponding incidence rates from the weighted historical controls (8.1%, 11.5%, and 5.0%), respectively. The MAH has proposed changes to the SmPC section 4.2 and 4.8; section 4.2 to provide specific guidance on the administration of rituximab according to the faster infusion schedule that was followed in Study ML25641, and section 4.8 to state that nothing new was observed in relation to IRRs from this study. The MAH is also asked to confirm that the stated concentration of the solution to be used for the faster infusion time is identical to what is normally used for first infusion. The proposed changes were further revised by the CHMP and are now acceptable. SmPC section 4.2 was amended accordingly, the SmPC was also harmonised with the already approved strengths for IV use, with the recently approved strength |

| II/0092 | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information on posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PERS). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/04/2014 | 23/05/2014 | SmPC | A previous drug safety report presented for the oncology approved indications (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, CLL) concluded that due to the unclear nature of the pathogenesis of PRES and the temporal association in the oncology populations, a contribution of rituximab could not be excluded. This is already reflected in the SmPC in section 4.8. At that time, no evidence of rituximab association in PRES in the autoimmune indications was found, therefore for rheumatoid arthritis PRES was not considered as an adverse drug reaction. In this variation an updated drug safety report concludes that no causal relationship with rituximab has been established for the autoimmune indications. PRES is reported very rarely with rituximab. The data and information do not confirm a clear causality but a contributive role of rituximab is possible due to the temporal relationship, although all cases with sufficient information reported notable additional risk factors for PRES. The proposed update to section 4.8 is considered to adequately reflect the data submitted, and the variation is recommended for a positive opinion. The newly submitted data do not change the overall benefit/risk which remains positive. |

| II/0090   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the 5 year follow up results from study PRIMA in maintenance therapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy, following a request from the CHMP in the context of MEA 072. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                                  | 25/04/2014   | 23/05/2014   | SmPC                             | The MAH for Mabthera has presented the five year update based on a median observation time of 73 months from the PRIMA trial. The benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy over observation both in terms of the primary endpoint PFS and in terms of the secondary endpoints event-free survival, overall response, time to next anti-lymphoma treatment, and time to next chemotherapy is considered clinically significant. Still, no difference in overall survival is observed. The number of deaths in the study remains too low to make definitive conclusions on OS at this time (stratified HR 1.02, p 0.8960, log-rank test). Longer follow-up would be needed in order to evaluate the effects of rituximab maintenance on OS in this study. At the time of reporting, the study protocol is being amended to extend the duration of survival follow-up until the end of 2016 in order to collect additional longer-term data on survival.

| II/0084   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to revise the safety information related to Stevens- Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) in patients receiving MabThera. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/03/2013   | 22/04/2013   | SmPC and PL | Cases of severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been very rarely reported in patients with autoimmune diseases with both first-time use and with later infusions. Some of the cases occurred on the day of dosing or within a few days of dosing. In other cases, the event occurred weeks or up to four months after the dose. Four of the cases in autoimmune patients had a close association in time to MabThera dosing (starting on the day of dosing or the next day), of which one case of TEN had a fatal outcome. In several of the cases in autoimmune patients, treatments known to be possibly associated with Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome were given concomitantly with MabThera therapy. The mechanism of these reactions remains unknown. Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases, of TEN have been reported very rarely in patients with haematological malignancies. This information was already included in the MabThera product information, which is now being updated to reflect the new safety information and to advise that if severe skin reactions occur, MabThera |

| II/0077/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC with regard to neutropenia further to the request of the CHMP during the assessment of the last PSUR and of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add adverse reactions regarding hypogammaglobulinaemia. In addition, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC has been included in relation to traceability of the medicinal product. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH has taken this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8 and to update the list of local representatives in the PL. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications | 19/04/2012 | 25/05/2012 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The MAH submitted safety reviews on neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia following treatment with MabThera in RA patients. While neutropenia was observed, the majority of events were transient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, were rarely reported in the post-marketing setting; however some were associated with fatal infections. The data from placebo controlled trials revealed that 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and 0.27% (2/731) of placebo patients developed severe neutropenia. Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) was observed in RA patients.

| II/0072   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with 3-year follow-up efficacy data from the phase III study ML17102 (also know as \"CLL-8\") in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). These follow-up data were requested by the CHMP as a follow-up measure (FUM061). Annex II has been updated to reflect the latest Risk Management Plan (RMP) version number (v. 6.0) and other minor editorial amendments have also been made in the labelling and package leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 19/05/2011   | 23/06/2011   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | Following the approval of the indication for the treatment of patients with CLL the MAH committed to submit the updated results from Study ML17102 (CLL-8) (FU2 061.1) which was the basis for the approval. The submitted data now resulted in a variation to update section 5.1. The data presented in this dossier from an additional three years of follow-up beyond that for the primary analysis of study ML17102 continue to demonstrate clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS for patients with previously untreated CLL when treated with R-FC compared to FC alone. PFS was significantly improved in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (adjusted HR 0.55, p < 0.0001, Wald test), consistent with the results of the primary analysis. The median PFS in the R-FC arm increased from 39.8 months to 55.3 months with extended follow-up, while that in the FC arm was similar over time (32.2 months vs 32.8 months). OS was significantly improved in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (adjusted HR 0.73, p = 0.0304, Wald test). Although the hazard ratio has increased over time (from 0.64 to 0.73), which is most likely related to an increasing imbalance between treatment arms with respect to receiving non-protocol rituximab-containing regimens, the trend of improved survival in favor of the R-FC arm was confirmed with extended follow-up. The clinical benefits seen in PFS and OS in the overall population were also observed in most of the patient subgroups analyzed. In particular, the risk of disease progression/ relapse or death among patients with Binet stage C disease reached statistical significance with extended follow-up (HR 0.68, p = 0.0224, Wald test).   |

Minor editorial changes are also included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 18/10/2007 | 19/11/2007 | SmPC        | The median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22.4 days (range, 6.14 to 51.9 days). Based on the subgroup dataset of Study IDEC 102-05, baseline CD19+ cell counts (CD19) and the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) were the most significant covariates influencing CL2. The overall effects of covariates in the final model explained approximately 27% of the inter-individual variability in CL2. SPD was the most significant covariate influencing Kdes, but explained only approximately 6% of the inter-individual variability for Kdes |

The large inter-individual variability on CL2 and Kdes remained after the inclusion of the CD19 and SPD covariates in the PK model. It is possible that the longitudinal SPD and CD19 data, which were not included in this analysis, might explain some of the remaining variability. Body surface area (BSA) was the most significant covariate influencing V1 and explained approximately 30% of the inter-individual variability in V1. The addition of covariate factors as predictors of variability in rituximab pharmacokinetics did not reduce unexplained inter- individual variability in CL1 and V1. It is possible that other covariate factors, not included in this analysis, might explain some of the remaining variability. The clinical relevance of this finding is that dose adjustment for known covariates (e.g, BSA) is not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in PK variability.

| II/0052 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/07/2007 | 03/09/2007 | SmPC and PL | In February 2007, the CHMP requested that the European Marketing Authorisation Holder, Roche, issue a DDL across the EU concerning the two reported cases of PML. Subsequently a new case of PML in a vasculitis patient was reported and the DDL was revised and issued as of 2 April 2007. The current variation is to update section 4.4. of the SPC and also section 4 of the PIL with appropriate wording covering PML in Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and autoimmune                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Since then, the position on the interpretation of PML cases reported in NHL patients has not changed. However, considering the severity of the conditions and the proposal to update the \"Warnings\" Section of the SPC with a statement regarding the observed cases of PML with off- label use of rituximab in SLE/vasculits patients, it is appropriate to include a text on PML in the \"Warnings\" Section of the SPC, in addition to the text in the post- marketing experience of the \"Undesirable Effects\" section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| II/0048 | The MAH applied to add efficacy information to section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties in the SPC, as a result of the availability of radiographic data. A minor editorial change has been introduced in the Package Leaflet to bring it in line with the latest QRD template. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 22/02/2007 | 27/03/2007 | SmPC and PL | In Study 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Patients originally receiving rituximab/MTX demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at 56 weeks. Of the patients originally receiving methotrexate alone, 81% received rituximab either as rescue between weeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A higher proportion of patients receiving the original rituximab/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression over 56 weeks (61% vs 52%). The present study has shown that rituximab has the ability to slow down the progression of structural damage in patients with active RA who had previously failed anti-TNF treatment. This effect is predominately seen in patients who possess RF or are anti- |
