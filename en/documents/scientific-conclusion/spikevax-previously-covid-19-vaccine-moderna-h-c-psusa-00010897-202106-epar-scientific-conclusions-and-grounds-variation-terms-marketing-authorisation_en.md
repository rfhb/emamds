## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleosidemodified) (Spikevax), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Paraesthesia

In view of available data on paraesthesia from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including cases with a plausible temporal relationship, and in view of plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) and paraesthesia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Spikevax) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
