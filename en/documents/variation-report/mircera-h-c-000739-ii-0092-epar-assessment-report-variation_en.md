## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 1 June 2022 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |

Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age requiring dialysis or not yet on dialysis and switching from another ESA to Mircera, based on final results from study NH19708; this is a single-arm, open-label, Phase II study of Mircera in patients aged 3 months to &lt;18 years with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis to generate PK, efficacy, and safety data for subcutaneous (SC) administration of Mircera. In addition, supportive data from studies NH19707, Modeling &amp; Simulation study (Study 3) and MH40258 were included. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to update the Instruction for Use in the Package Leaflet.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0317/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0317/2017 was completed.

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0317/2017.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

Kidney disease is defined as an abnormality of kidney structure or function with implications for the health of an individual, which can occur abruptly, and either resolve or become chronic. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function with variable  clinical  presentation,  in  part  related  to  cause,  severity  and  the  rate  of  progression  (Kidney International Supplements, 2012).

Several paediatric nephrology societies from European countries have provided data on the incidence of CKD in children, as summarized by Harambat et al, 2012. Based on this data, even though age categories and the definition of CKD differed among countries, the incidence in Europe was broadly consistent, around 11-12 per million age-related populations for CKD stages 3-5, and 8 per million age-related population for CKD stages 4-5. Children in CKD represent a very small percentage of the total of CKD population (NAPRTCS 2014 Annual Report and USRDS 2016 Annual Report).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Anaemia is a common comorbidity in patients with CKD, including children. This condition is associated with multiple adverse clinical consequences and its management is a core component of nephrology care. Increased morbidity and mortality, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased quality of life have been associated with anaemia of CKD, also in children. Although numerous complex factors interact in the development of this anaemia, erythropoietin deficiency and iron dysregulation (including iron deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis) are the primary causes. The symptoms associated with anaemia  include  fatigue,  decreased  exercise  tolerance,  cardiac  dysfunction  and  impaired  cognitive function. The mechanism of anaemia due to CKD in children is identical to that in adults.

The principal aims of anaemia management are to alleviate signs and symptoms arising from anaemia, improve quality  of  life,  and  to  reduce  the  need  for  blood  or  red  blood  cell  transfusions.  Exogenous replacement of erythropoietin is an established method for treatment of symptomatic anaemia in CKD. This therapy can be divided into two phases: the initial correction phase, during which haemoglobin (Hb) levels rise and reach plateau levels, and the subsequent maintenance phase during which plateau levels are maintained by regular erythropoietin administration.

Currently available treatment options for the management of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD include  short-acting  human recombinant erythropoietins and longer-acting erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). In Europe, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta and darbepoetin alfa are approved for the treatment of anaemia due to CKD in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and zeta are approved for patients  aged  1  to  18  years  on  haemodialysis  (HD),  and  epoetin  beta  is  approved  for  treating symptomatic  anaemia  caused  by  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  yet  on  dialysis. Darbepoetin was approved by EMA for paediatric patients on and not yet on dialysis in 2015. Darbepoetin and epoetin beta are approved for IV as well as SC use in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and epoetin zeta are approved for paediatric patients on HD, and dosing recommendations are given for IV use only.

## 2.1.2. About the product

Mircera  (methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-epoetin  beta)  is  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  currently approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients. It has an increased half-life compared to erythropoietin. Mircera was first approved in Europe on 20 July 2007 for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients.

In  Europe,  pursuant  to  Article  16(1)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as  amended  the  marketing authorization holder (MAH) submitted on 08 February 2008 an application for a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Mircera (EMEA-000172-PIPO-07) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which was initially agreed on 23 February 2009. A subsequent modification to the PIP was approved in 2012 (EMEA000172-PIP-07-M01). In September 2016, the MAH submitted another PIP modification, EMEA 000172PIP-01-07-M02 for which a negative opinion was received. Therefore, in 2017, an additional modification of  this  agreed  PIP,  a  waiver  for  a  paediatric  subset  and  a  proposed  deferral  were  submitted.  The modification  proposed  was  the  replacement  of  a  Phase  III  study  with  a  single-arm  Phase  II  study (NH19707 and NH19708) of Mircera in patients aged 3 months to &lt;18 years with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis to generate PK, efficacy, and safety data for subcutaneous (SC) administration of Mircera. In addition, an extrapolation and simulation study ('Study 3') was added with the aim to pool study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NH19708 data with  the  PK/PD  model  developed  on  adult  Phase  II/III  data  and  later  updated  after including  NH19707  data.  The  EMA  approved  the  modification  of  the  agreed  PIP  for  Mircera  (EMEA000172-PIP01-07-M03) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 on 31 October 2017. The general approach was also considered acceptable by the FDA following the submission of an updated Paediatric Development Plan in February 2017.

The purpose of this submission is to seek approval for the extension of indication to include treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age on ESA maintenance treatment.

The clinical summary documents supporting this submission comprises 2 clinical phase II studies and an analysis of extrapolation and pooling data from adults and paediatric patients for a PK/PD model-based evaluation. Supportive data from a non-interventional study has also been provided.

## 2.1.3. General comments on compliance with GCP

According to the MAH, study NH19707 and NH19708 were conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:

- -Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines
- -Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines
- -Applicable laws and regulations

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH has submitted information for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin  beta  in  accordance  with  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2  guidance,  to  propose  an extension of the indication to the paediatric population.

No additional non-clinical information (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology) was submitted.

## 2.2.2. Toxicology

No toxicology information has been submitted.

In the 13-week repeat dose toxicity studies performed with Mircera, rats and dogs were administered higher amount of PEG (1.86-fold in rats and 6.2-fold in dogs) than that the children will be dosed, and no vacuolation in any of the examined organs and tissues were reported in these studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH has presented an ERA based on the Guidance on 'Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, also named Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.).

C.E.R.A. is a chemically modified protein and it is not known to be an endocrine disrupter, and it is also not suspected to be a carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substance.

## Phase I: Estimation of exposure

- Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.

The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow) for C.E.R.A has been estimated to be &lt; 3, taking into the high water solubility of &gt;17.5 g/l.

As the estimated log KOW value is below the cu-off of 4.5, a PBT assessment is not required.

- Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC)

The PEC has been calculated, according to the formula established in the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2:

```
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * FPEN) / (default WASTEWinhab * default DILUTION)
```

The maximum daily dose for C.E.R.A. used as a worst-case for the environmental risk assessment, is 0.8 mg/d. Then,

- = (0.8 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10) = 0.000004 mg/L = 0.004 μg/L

Therefore, the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not exceeded, and risk assessment could be stopped.

The applicant, in accordance with the ERA draft guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1, EMA 2018), calculates a new PEC, using a refined FPEN. For the purpose of the FPEN derivation a prevalence 10 per 100,000 people was used. Using the duration of one treatment period (tTREATMENT) of 1 day, assuming the number of treatments per year (nTREATMENT) as 26 (every two weeks) and applying the default number of days per year (Nd) of 365, the refined fraction of a population receiving C.E.R.A. during a given time (FPEN-REFINED) can be calculated as follows:

FPEN-REFINED = (FPEN-DEFAULT × tTREATMENT × nTREATMENT) ÷ Nd

```
= (0.01 × 1 × 26) ÷ 365 = 0.00071
```

The refined PECSURFACEWATER is calculated as follows:

PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * FPEN-REFINED / default WASTEWinhab * default DILUTION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The applicant concludes that the PECSURFACEWATER is below the EMA (2006) guidance action limit of 0,01 μg/l. Since the PECSURFACEWATER for C.E.R.A. is below 0.01 μg/l, and no other environmental concerns are noted, it is assumed that C.E.R.A. is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment following prescribed use in patients. A Tier A Phase 2 ERA is not required.

However, a limited set of biodegradability and acute ecotoxicity tests were performed for the purpose of classification  and  labelling.  Specifically,  a  ready  biodegradability  test  as  well  as  acute  tests  for  algal growth  inhibition,  daphnid  immobilisation  and  fish  mortality  were  performed  according  to  OECD guidelines and in compliance with the OECD Principles on Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).

## Phase II-Tier A: Environmental fate and effects analysis

- Physico-chemical properties and fate

## Biodegradation

A ready  biodegradability  test according  to  OECD  301  F  in  compliance  with  GLP  showed  46% mineralisation by BOD/ThOD after 28 days. However, complete primary degradation was observed within 4 days of incubation (figure 1).

Figure  1.  OECD  301F,  test  performed  using  regular  RO0503821  injection  solution;  initial concentration adjusted to 100 mg RO0503821/l; RO0503821 analysed by HPLC; NO2/NO3 determined at end of test.

The  applicant  concludes  that  C.E.R.A.  is  not  readily  biodegradable.  However,  complete  primary degradation with mineralisation presumably of the protein part of the molecule occurs.

- Aquatic effects studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Toxicity  data  on  algae,  daphnia  and  fish  were  performed  for  C.E.R.A.  The  main  information  of  the conducted studies and the study results are summarised in the table below:

## · Calculation of Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC)

The  acute-based  surface  water  PNEC is  estimated  as  the  lowest  of  the  three  acute  surface  water ecotoxicity  EC50/LC50 values  divided  by  an  assessment  factor  of  1000.  In  the  case  of  C.E.R.A.,  with EC50/LC50  values  of  &gt;200  mg/l  for  algae,  daphnids  and  fish  the  following  surface  water  PNEC (PNECSURFACEWATER) was derived:

PNECSURFACEWATER = 200 mg/l ÷ 1000 = 0.2 mg/l = 200 μ g/l.

- Calculation of the groundwater PNEC (PNECGROUNDWATER)

The groundwater PNEC (PNECGROUNDWATER) is approximated as the acute EC50 for daphnids of &gt;200 mg/l divided by an assessment factor of 1000:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PNECGROUNDWATER = 200 mg/l ÷ 1000 = 0.2 mg/l = 200 μ g/l

- Calculation of the groundwater PEC (PECGROUNDWATER)

According  to  the  guideline,  the  PECGROUNDWATER  can  be  assumed  to  be  typically  0.25  times  the PECSURFACEWATER. For C.E.R.A., PECGROUNDWATER of 0.0003 µg/L* 0,25 = 0.000075 µg/L

- Calculation of the sewage treatment PEC (PECSTP)

The PECSTP is approximated as the surface water PEC multiplied by 10 (the default surface water dilution factor used in the PECSURFACEWATER calculation):

PECSTP = 0.0003 μ g/l × 10 = 0.003 μ g/l

- Calculation of the sewage treatment PNEC (PNECSTP)

An activated sludge respiration inhibition test according to OECD 209 over 3 hours was not performed. However, the toxicity control in the OECD 301 F ready biodegradability test resulted in a NOEC over 14 days of 100 mg/l nominal concentration (NC)

Based on this substitute data the bacterial PNEC for sewage treatment is calculated as the inhibition control NOEC divided by an assessment factor of 10 according to REACH:

## Outcome of Tier A fate and effects analysis

The surface water PEC/PNEC risk characterisation ratio based on acute toxicity data with algae, daphnids and fish is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The groundwater PEC÷PNEC risk characterisation ratio based on acute daphnid data is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The sewage treatment PEC÷PNEC risk characterisation ratio is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It is concluded by the applicant that, since the risk characterisation ratios are 0.000001, 0.0000004 and 0.0000003,  C.E.R.A  is  not  expected  to  cause  a  risk  to  surface  waters,  groundwaters  and  sewage treatment, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.4. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical toxicology information has been submitted. PEG has shown to lead to accumulation and vacuolation within specific cells of the CNS (choroid plexus epithelia), liver and kidney in nonclinical species treated with other PEGylated medicinal product. In the 13-week repeat dose toxicity studies performed with Mircera, rats and dogs were administered higher amount of PEG (1.86-fold in rats and 6.2-fold in dogs) than that the children will be dosed, and no vacuolation in any of the examined organs and tissues were reported in these studies. The relevance of these data is limited by the lack of exposure data  to  PEG  in  animals  and  humans  following  Mircera  treatment.  However,  the  amount  of  PEG administered to humans as part of Mircera (0.000186 µmol/kg/month) is significantly lower (~2000 fold) than  the  exposure  threshold  value  of  0.4  µmol/kg/month  proposed  in  the  Safety  Working  Party's response to the PDCO regarding the use of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population and thus, it seems unlikely that PEG levels in humans can reach this threshold value. In addition, in vivo distribution data indicated that Mircera can reach brain, but at low levels, and it should be considered that PEG-induced cell vacuolation observed in toxicity studies performed with other PEGylated medicinal products were not associated to functional consequences.

Clinical experience with Mircera in adults and paediatric patients also did not raise any safety concerns pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation.

In conclusion, all data together support that Mircera is not expected to cause any safety concern as a consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation to the CNS and other tissues.

No new studies have been carried out to assess the environmental risk.

An estimation of exposure of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in the environment, taking into account the prevalence of the disease, has been provided. In this way, the applicant has calculated a PEC  using  a  refined  Fpen,  which,  as  mentioned,  follows  the  postulates  of  the  ERA  draft  guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1, EMA 2018). Although the use of this refined Fpen is considered acceptable, the CHMP pointed that the approaches discussed in this ERA draft guidance are currently in draft format and their guidance are not in force at this present time. Although the principles of the draft guideline, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1, EMA 2018, can be acknowledged by the CHMP, current authoritative guidance is EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, EMA 2006.

Since the PECSURFACEWATER value for methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is less than 0.01 μg/L, and no other environmental concerns have been reported, it is assumed that the medicinal product is unlikely to pose a risk for the environment following prescribed use in patients.

In addition, a biodegradability and three aquatic effect studies, that were performed for the purpose of classification and labelling, have been provided for this variation.

The biodegradability methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was assessed by the MAH following the OECD guideline 301. methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is considered not readily biodegradable and, therefore, a Phase II Tier B does not have to be carried out.

In toxicity studies, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta does not show toxicity to aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids and fish).

No further assessment is needed to characterize the risk of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta to the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The MAH provided a weight of evidence approach regarding the risk of PEG-induced cell vacuolation following Mircera treatment to paediatric population. Available non-clinical and clinical data with Mircera did not raise any safety concerns pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation.

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. Considering the above data, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

REPORT  NO.  1046298:  Validation  of  an  Immunoassay  Method  for  the  Determination  of  Anti-EPO Antibodies in Human Serum YBS Study YCM/010

A bioanalytical procedure was developed to determine the presence of anti-EPO antibodies (ADA) in human serum (Screening Assay). A test was also established to confirm the specificity of the anti-EPO antibodies (Confirmatory Assay).

The presence of anti-EPO antibodies is determined using a bridging ELISA format. Briefly, biotin labelled EPO is added to the streptavidin coated microtitre plate. After a wash step, aliquots of pre-mixed serum samples and digoxigenylated EPO are then added to the microtitre plate and incubated. After a wash step, anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated to HRP are added to the microtitre plate and incubated. After a final wash step, a colorimetric HRP substrate (TMB) is incubated, stop solution (0.25 M sulphuric acid) is added then the optical density at 450 nm (Ref 630 nm) is measured.

Samples are initially analysed using the screening assay. Samples identified as positive are tested in the confirmatory assay in the presence of excess unlabelled drug. Finally, if required, the samples confirmed positive may be assayed at different dilutions to determine anti-EPO antibody titer.

- Cut point and Normalization Factor Determination:

To determine cut point (CP), 40 individual blank matrix samples were assayed in duplicate on three separate occasions resulting in 120 mean assay values. The global mean optical density of NC for the six batches was equal to 0.0805. The normalization factor (NF) was determined as CP minus the global mean optical density of NC, and this NF is to be used for plate specific CP calculation in subsequent analytical runs.

The summary of CP determination is presented below:

CP = 0.09875

Global mean NC = 0.0805

NF = 0.01825

Plate specific CP (floating CP) = mean assay NC + 0.01825

CP of each subsequent plate is to be calculated as the mean of 8 replicates of NC run on that plate + 0.01825 .

- Low and High Positive Control: The antibody concentration corresponding to the assay response at LPC was back-calculated and was 14.6 ng/mL. The LPC was prepared in bulk by spiking the positive control antibody into NC serum at 14.6 ng/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots. The concentration of the HPC was selected at 369 ng/mL. The HPC was prepared in bulk by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

spiking the positive control antibody into NC serum at 369 ng/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots.

The intra-assay precision of NC ranged from 2.2 to 27.3 %*. The intra-assay precision of LPC ranged from 1.1 to 7.0 %. The intra-assay precision of HPC ranged from 0.9 to 5.2 %. The interassay precision of NC was 23.7 %*. The inter-assay precision of LPC was 13.8 %. The interassay precision of HPC was 11.5 %.

- Assay sensitivity: Assay sensitivity, calculated as the average of the antibody concentration at CP obtained from the nine curves, was 8.87 ng/mL.
- Drug tolerance: The highest drug concentration still providing  a positive  result  (mean  assay response  above  CP)  was  considered  as  the  assay  drug  tolerance  for  the  specific  antibody concentration.
- Stabilities:
- o The stability of the positive control antibody at room temperature in NC serum up to 4 hours: LQC: %CV=4.8%. HQC: CV=1.5%.
- o Freeze/thaw: Six cycles: LQC: %CV=1.8%. HQC: CV=3.0%.
- o Freezer stability: The freezer stability of the positive control antibody in NC serum was investigated at -80 and -20ºC for 3 weeks. LQC: %CV=1.9%. HQC: CV=4.7% at -80 ºC. LQC: %CV=1.8%. HQC: CV=3.5% at -20 ºC.
- Determination of confirmatory cut-point (CCP): A sample with ratio of assay response in the presence of 10 μg/mL EPO to a ssay response in the absence of added EPO less than 0.848 is confirmed positive for the presence of specific antibodies.

## REPORT NO. 1046299. Validation of an Immunoassay Method for the Determination of Anti-RO0503821 (Anti-Mircera) Antibodies in Human Serum from Study YCM/009.

A bioanalytical procedure was developed to determine the presence of anti-RO0503821 antibodies (ADA) in human serum (Screening Assay). A test was also established to confirm the specificity of the antiRO0503821 antibodies (Confirmatory Assay). The presence of anti-RO0503821 antibodies is determined using a bridging ELISA format similar to the one described above.

- Cut point and Normalization Factor Determination:

To determine cut point (CP), 40 individual blank matrix samples were assayed in duplicate on three separate occasions resulting in 120 mean assay values. The global mean optical density of NC for the six batches was equal to 0.0215. The normalization factor (NF) was determined as CP minus the global mean optical density of NC, and this NF is to be used for plate specific CP calculation in subsequent analytical runs.

The summary of CP determination is presented below:

CP = 0.03861

Global mean NC = 0.0215

NF = 1.8

Plate specific CP (floating CP) = mean assay x 1.8

CP of each subsequent plate is to be calculated as the mean of 8 replicates of NC run on that plate multiplied by 1.8 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Low and High Positive Control: The antibody concentration corresponding to the assay response at LPC was back-calculated and was 0.208 µ g/mL. The LPC was prepared in bulk by spiking the positive control antibody into NC serum at 0.208 µ g/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots. The concentration of the HPC was selected at 5.54 µ g/mL. The HPC was prepared in bulk by spiking the positive control antibody into NC serum at 5.54 µ g/mL and stored frozen as single use aliquots.

The intra-assay precision of NC ranged from 7.7 to 31.8 %*. The intra-assay precision of LPC ranged from 1.8 to 13.2 %. The intra-assay precision of HPC ranged from 1.1 to 6.7%. The interassay precision of NC was 21.7 %*. The inter-assay precision of LPC was 20.3 %*. The interassay precision of HPC was 21.0 %*.

- Assay sensitivity: Assay sensitivity, calculated as the average of the antibody concentration at CP obtained from the nine curves, was 0.0575 μg/mL.
- Drug tolerance: The highest drug concentration still providing  a positive  result  (mean  assay response  above  CP)  was  considered  as  the  assay  drug  tolerance  for  the  specific  antibody concentration.
- Stabilities:
- o The stability of the positive control antibody at room temperature in NC serum up to 4 hours: LQC: %CV=1.7%. HQC: CV=2.3%.
- o Freeze/thaw: Six cycles: LQC: %CV=7.8%. HQC: CV=8.2%.
- o Freezer stability: The freezer stability of the positive control antibody in NC serum was investigated at -80 and -20ºC for 2 weeks. LQC: %CV=6.4%. HQC: CV=2.7% at -80 ºC. LQC: %CV=7.3%. HQC: CV=2.9% at -20 ºC.
- Determination of confirmatory cut-point (CCP): A sample with ratio of assay response in the presence of 10 μg/mL RO0503821 to assay response in the absence of added RO0503821 less than 0.519 is confirmed positive for the presence of specific antibodies.

## REPORT NO. 1054621. Validation of an ELISA Method for the Determination of RO0503821 (Mircera) in Human Serum from Study YCM/013 (including Add I).

The objective of this study was to validate an analytical method for the determination of RO0503821 in human serum, over a concentration range of 150 to 4000 pg/mL, using a sample volume of 50 μL.

## Calibration Curve Standards

Each run contained a calibration set of 8 calibration standards in duplicate.

Two calibration standards were rejected but only in one of the duplicates.

The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Nominal) ranged from 6.2% to 13.5% and from 99.3% to 103.3%, respectively.

## Quality control samples

Each run contained two sets of 4 QC levels.

No QC was out of the acceptance range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Nominal) ranged from 7.8% to 27.7%* and 91.7% to 112.5%, respectively.

The target LLOQ in this study was 150 pg/mL. CV: 7.8% and bias 2.7%.

One  sample  of lipaemic  serum  and  one  sample  of  haemolysed  serum were  each  be  spiked  with RO0503821 to the concentration level of the Low QC sample. The mean bias in lipaemic and haemolysed serum were -0.5% and -6.0%, respectively. And the CV was 1.5% and 2.9 %, respectively, therefore there is no effect of lipaemia or haemolysis on the assay.

## Stabilities:

- Room temperature 24 hours: LQC: CV (%): 0.8%. Difference from nominal (%): 5.5%. HQC: CV (%): 17.0%. Difference from nominal (%): -0.9%.
- Five cycles of freeze-thaw: LQC: CV (%): 5.1%. Difference from nominal (%): 9.3%. HQC: CV (%): 18.5%. Difference from nominal (%): 1.6%.
- Long term in matrix at -20ºC for one month: LQC: CV (%): 189.3%. Difference from nominal (%): -20%. HQC: CV (%): 5.3%. Difference from nominal (%): -16.3%

## REPORT  NO.  1062976.  Validation  of  a  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  and  confirmation  of neutralizing antibodies against Mircera in human serum samples

The anti- Mircera NAb assay is a quasi-quantitative cell assay based on stimulation of ASE2 cells. This direct  NAb  assay  is  based  on  growth  stimulation  of  AS-E2  cells  induced  by  Mircera  followed  by  the measurement of ATP using the CeiiTiter Glo® ATP luminescence assay. In the presence of neutralizing anti-  Mircera  antibodies,  growth  stimulation  is  diminished  or  stopped,  depending  on  the  antibody concentration.

## Pharmacokinetics in the target population

## Study NH19707

Study NH19707 was designed to determine the starting dose of IV Mircera in paediatric patients (aged 5-17 years) with anaemia associated with CKD on HD when switching from stable maintenance treatment with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa  and  to  demonstrate  changes  in  Hb  over  time  in response to different doses of Mircera. The study also aimed to evaluate the PK of Mircera in paediatric patients.

A full model (ROCH1061b31) included effects of body weight and age on both CL and V. The effect of age on CL was removed during the backward deletion step, the resulting model (ROCH1061b34) was the final model. Its parameter estimates are recorded in Table 5. Parameters estimates were consistent to those found during the Phase 3 analysis, especially CL estimated at 0.74 L/day versus 0.75 L/day. V and F were lower 3.5 L and 0.33 respectively compared to Phase 3 estimates (4.7 L and 0.39). The estimates of body weight effects on CL and V were higher compared to previous estimates: 0.76 versus 0.57 and 0.61 versus 0.44. The derived ka value was 0.41 /day, lower by two-fold than the Phase 3 estimates.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  alternative  parameterization  used  here.  Diagnostic  plots presented in Figure 2 were good without major trend in residuals versus time or population predictions.

Model qualification  was  performed  using  pcVPC  in  adult  patients  receiving  Mircera  iv,  adult  patients receiving  Mircera  sc  (Figure  3)  and  paediatric  patients  receiving  Mircera  iv  (Figure  4).  The  central tendency and the variability were well captured by the model. There was a slight tendency towards under prediction with the sc route of administration. In adults, the observed and the simulated data reflect the variety  of  dosing  intervals:  every  1,  2,  3  or  4  weeks.  This  assessment  of  the  model  predictive performance  qualified  its  use  to  perform  the  PK/PD  analysis  and  exploratory  simulations  e.g. investigating sc administration of Mircera.

The previous final model ROCH1061b34 was used as a starting point. It was first fitted as is allowing the re-estimation of all fixed and random effects. Then, the paediatric effect on the SC bioavailability was tested as a flag being paediatric yes/no or by testing an age effect on it. The model having paediatric flag (Ped Frel) was selected as it resulted in a larger drop in objective function value. Table 9 present the population PK parameters estimates of the re-fitted historical final model after adding paediatric effect on the SC bioavailability. All parameters were very well estimated with parameters consistent with the previous analysis.

Figure 5. Diagnostic plots of the final PK model overall and in paediatrics

Model qualification was performed using pcVPC stratified by adult and study and it is presented in Figure 6. The central tendency and the variability in paediatric patients were overall well captured by the model for both routes of administration with some tendency towards under prediction at low concentrations. This assessment of the model predictive performance qualified its use to perform the sequential PK/PD analysis in paediatric patients.

## Immunogenicity

## Study NH19707

In Study NH19707, blood samples to measure anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies were collected on Day 1 (before the first drug administration), at Week 13 and at final visit of the core period (Week 21), and at final visit (Week 73) of the safety extension period.

No  patients  tested  positive  for  anti-Mircera  and  anti-EPO  antibodies  at  any  time  during  the  study, including the safety extension period. For this reason, the present summary of clinical pharmacology studies does not include any information about correlation between immunogenicity and PK, PD, safety, or efficacy.

## Study NH19708

In Study NH19708, blood samples to measure anti-EPO and anti-Mircera antibodies were collected on Day 1 (before the first drug administration), at Week 9 and at final visit of the Core period (Week 21), and at final visit (Week 45) of the safety extension period.

A total of 131 samples were tested for anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Two samples tested positive for  anti-Mircera  antibodies  and  four  samples  tested  positive  for  anti-EPO  antibodies  in  2  patients.

However, in both  of  these  patients,  there  was  no  evidence  of  PRCA  or  other  safety  concerns.  Both patients continued to show good Hb response to Mircera treatment. Hb and Mircera doses were stable. The PK parameters in these 2 patients were not different from the rest of the patients in Study NH19708.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

## Study NH19707

The PK/PD dataset included EBEs of PK parameters obtained with the final PK model. It consisted of the same patient population as the PK dataset and comprised 14366 data points: 12786 from adults and 1580 from paediatrics.

Parameters estimates of the final PK/PD model are recorded in Table 10. Fixed effects were fixed to Phase 3 estimates. There was a full matrix of random effects with strong correlation particularly between Smax and SC50 i.e., 0.92, all covariance terms were well estimated. Interindividual variability in PK/PD parameters  was  found  consistent  with  Phase  3  estimates,  with  low  shrinkage.  The  estimate  of  the previous ESA dose effect on SC50 i.e., 0.389 was consistent with the Phase 3 estimate i.e., 0.303. Diagnostic plots in paediatric and adult patients presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 showed minor trends in population predictions.

Model qualification in paediatric patients was performed using VPC stratified by dose group. Results are presented in Figure 9. In both panels, model-based simulations well captured the variability in the data; the observed mean Hb time course (and its confidence interval) was also fairly well captured by the prediction  interval  of  the  simulated  mean  in  both  treatment  groups.  During  the  first  8  weeks  the prediction interval was on some occasions slightly above the confidence interval, however the overall shape  of  the  observed  mean  and  especially  the  fluctuations  during  the  evaluation  period  were  well captured by the model in both groups. Further model qualification was performed using PPC stratified by dose group. Table 11 demonstrates the qualification of the simulation framework on three endpoints: mean change from baseline in Hb, occurrence of Hb&gt;12g/dL during the evaluation period and doses at the end of the evaluation period. All prediction intervals included the corresponding observed value in NH19707  for  each  treatment  group  and  each  endpoint  of  interest.  This  assessment  of  the  model predictive  performance  qualified  its  use  to  perform  exploratory  simulations  e.g.  investigating  sc administration of Mircera.

The estimate of the previous ESA dose effect on SC50, i.e. 0.295, was slightly lower than the previous estimate  of  0.389.  Hb0  was  7%  and  14%  lower  in  peritoneal  dialysis  and  hemodialysis  paediatric patients,  respectively.  While  LS  was  18%  and  38%  shorter  in  peritoneal  dialysis  and  hemodialysis patients, respectively.

## Study MH40258

Study MH40258 was a non-interventional study secondary data use (NIS SDU) and voluntary postauthorization safety study (PASS) that collected data elements of patients who received Mircera. The data were extracted from two existing registries within the IPDN (International Paediatric Peritoneal Network [IPPN] and International Paediatric Haemodialysis Network [IPHN]). The data was collected for a period from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2021 for IPPN and from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2021 for IPHN. Study MH40258 did not provide PK data for the model-based analyses but contributed real world data  from  the  IPDN  registry.  The  data  from  Study  MH40258  (i.e.,  Hb  levels  and  Mircera  dose  time courses) was used to perform visual comparison with the clinical trials data and PK/PD model predictions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data was extracted from all paediatric patients below 18 years of age on PD or HD included in the IPPN and IPHN registries with at least one observation while being treated with Mircera.

As shown in Figure 13, the clinical trial data spanned the same ranges and were similar to those collected from the IPDN registry, which provided additional evidence that the clinical trial data could be reproduced in clinical practice.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The characterization of the clinical pharmacology properties of Mircera in paediatric patients after IV and SC  administration  has  been  conducted  in  the  current  analysis  based  on  the  experimental  evidence collected in studies NH19707, NH19708 and MH40258.

The modelling strategy used by the MAH is endorsed, since it re-uses the structural PK and PK/PD model definition established in the adult population and the clinical evidence collected in paediatric patients is pooled together with the adult data to re-evaluate its predictive performance. In addition, the Applicant conducted a staggered approach, since first IV data was analysed and secondly, PK evidence after SC administration  was  incorporated.  A  similar  approach  was  applied  to  characterize  the  time  course  of haemoglobin over time after IV and SC in paediatric patients.

The final population PK model developed with data from studies NH19707 and NH19708 and adult data may  overall  capture  the  observed  data.  However,  the  provided  pcVPC  for  adult  data  following  SC administration, shows that the model excessively underpredicts the median of the data, which indicates that the estimated bioavailability of 31% may be biased and the true SC bioavailability for adults is higher than this estimate. Furthermore, the SmPC states that the SC bioavailability for adult CKD patients was 54% and 62% for non-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively, which is almost 2-fold higher than the estimate from the popPK model. An updated version of the population PK model has been developed, which includes a specific volume of distribution for adult patients treated with Mircera SC. However, the effect of the route of administration in pediatric patients was not significant, possibly due to the lack of sufficient experimental evidence. The updated version improves the model performance based on the VPC. However, no differences in the volume of distribution could be attributed to the type of dialysis. Despite the SmPC reports different SC bioavailability based on the type of dialysis, the population PK model did not identify such effect as significant. In addition, a relevant aspect required clarification since a 2.18-fold increase on SC bioavailability was estimated in paediatric patients compared to adult patients, considering that a higher exposure in paediatric subjects may be relevant in terms of safety concerns. Since  no  definitive  and  clear  exposure-safety  relationship  has  been  established,  dose  selection  in pediatric  patients  is  based  under  the  assumption  that  similar  exposure  should  be  achieved  between pediatric and adult patients. In this regard, the MAH has provided the observed concentrations data for pediatric and adult patients, showing similar trend among both populations. Therefore, no need for a model-based evaluation of the exposure is required.

The PK/PD framework previously developed in the adult population has been applied to characterize paediatric observations. Final PK/PD parameter estimates were consistent with the estimated values in adult patients and therefore, no relevant differences in terms of system-related parameters (LS and Hb0) were observed. The use of fixed drug-related parameters may be justified based on the large evidence from adult data and to reduce the likely confounding effect on the estimation of the covariate effects.  The  join  PK/PD  model  with  adult  and  paediatric  data  was  able  to  characterize  the  median tendency and the overall variability. The external evaluation of the PK/PD relationship using real world data  (MH40258)  demonstrated  the  adequacy  of  the  modelling  structure  to  satisfy  the  observed behaviour.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology properties of Mircera in paediatric patients after IV and SC administration have been characterized. Some aspects have not been fully clarified, however, since no definitive and clear exposure-safety relationship has been established, and dose selection in pediatric patients is based under the assumption that similar exposure should be achieved between pediatric and adult patients, a modelbased evaluation of the exposure is no longer being required.

The overall strategy and the results provided are overall acceptable.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

The efficacy  is  based  on  the  extrapolation  from  adult  data,  two  dose  finding  studies  (NH19707  and NH19708) and a popPK model. Results from paediatric registry study MH40258 are considered supportive for the claimed indication.

## 2.4.1. Main studies

Study NH19707: a phase II, dose-finding study, open-label, multicenter, multiple dose study of Mircera administered once every 4 weeks intravenously (IV) for 20 weeks in paediatric patients with CKD receiving haemodialysis who switched from other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa).

## Methods

After the first administration of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera), dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week during the core study period. The evaluation period for Hb levels was Week 17-21. Patients who completed the 20 weeks of treatment and who adequately maintained Hb levels were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period with the same dosing frequency.

In this study, the protocol foresaw different groups with different conversion factors related to their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. The first group comprised patients who started  with  an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose  (Group  1  hereinafter).  If  this  intermediate conversion factor proved inadequate, a second group (Group 2) was enrolled for treatment with a higher or lower conversion factor dose. The first 16 patients were enrolled in Group 1. After 16 patients had completed at least 16 weeks of treatment, a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of Mircera was made.

The target population comprised paediatric patients 5-17 years old with clinically stable chronic renal anaemia  on  haemodialysis  treatment  and  who  were  receiving  maintenance  treatment  with  an erythropoietic agent (at least 8 weeks before enrolment).

At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥ 5 years to &lt; 12 years. Additionally, the aim was to recruit equal numbers of patients previously treated with darbepoetin alfa and those treated with epoetin alfa or beta.

## Key inclusion criteria:

- -Paediatric patients 5 17 years old (in Russia only: 12-17 years old) with clinically stable chronic renal anaemia
- -Haemodialysis treatment for at least 8 weeks
- -Body weight ≥ 10 kg
- -Adequate haemodialysis: urea reduction ratio (URR) of ≥ 65% or Kt/V ≥ 1.2 for patients on three-times weekly haemodialysis. Patients with fewer or with more haemodialysis sessions per week had to have a weekly Kt/V ≥ 3.6.
- -Baseline pre-dialysis Hb concentration 10.0 - 12.0 g/dL determined from the mean of weekly Hb values measured between weeks -2 to -1.

- -Stable maintenance epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, or darbepoetin alfa treatment with no weekly dose change ≥ 25% (increase or decrease) during the 2-weeks of screening. Patients who had been previously treated by the SC route could only participate if they had been receiving their ESA by the iv route for at least 8 weeks before screening.
- -Adequate iron status defined as serum ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 20% (or percentage of hypochromic red cells &lt; 10%); mean of two values measured during screening weeks -2 and -1.

## Treatments

Mircera was injected iv by trained healthcare professional once every four weeks during the study (4 doses during the titration period and one dose during the evaluation period).

The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance doses of an ESA prior to conversion to Mircera, and assuming a linear relationship across dose ranges, the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose, thus correcting for the higher weight-adjusted dose requirements in paediatric patients.

| High conversion factor? (Group 2)       | 4 x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose (μg) /0.55 | Onceevery 4 weeks     |

Dose adjustments could be performed during the entire study (core study period and safety extension period) (Table 15). The dose of Mircera was adjusted to maintain the individual patient's Hb within a target range of ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and between 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL.

All  treatments  (medications  and  medical  procedures)  were  permitted  before  screening,  during  the screening period and throughout the 20-weeks treatment period except for: investigational medicinal product, other ESAs, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (except for medical need), immunosupressive therapies known to exacerbate anaemia or intermittent treatment or dose change of medications known to influence Hb concentration. Supplemental iron was administered to prevent iron deficiency during the screening period and during study, and to maintain adequate iron parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The primary objectives were:

- -To determine the starting dose of Mircera in paediatric patients with CKD on haemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa
- -To demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of Mircera

The secondary objectives were:

- -To study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Mircera in paediatric patients
- -To explore Mircera exposure-response relationship
- -To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Mircera in paediatric patients
- -To document long-term safety and efficacy of Mircera administration in paediatric patients with anaemia associated with CKD

- -Vital signs (weight, blood pressure, heart rate)

## Sample size

This was an exploratory study without a powered statistical group comparison. Therefore, no formal sample size estimation was performed. However, to determine the optimum starting dose of iv Mircera, the following sample-size calculations were made as an indication. Providing the optimum dose maintains the Hb at the baseline level and the true change from baseline was equal to zero, the number of patients sufficient to provide 80% power that the 90% CI for Hb change from baseline was between -1 and +1 g/dL is:

- 16 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was &lt;1.3 g/dL
- 36 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was &lt;2.0 g/dL

As per Protocol, additional patients were enrolled to replace patients who did not complete at least 18 weeks of treatment, to ensure a sufficient number of evaluable patients.

At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥ 5 to &lt;12 years.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  enrolled  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  four  weeks  in  sequential  dosing  groups;  no randomization was performed. An Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IV/WRS) system was used to track the enrolment and to monitor the disposition of patients into four strata with respect to type of previous ESA treatment and age category. Enrolment of 12- to 17-year-old patients was closed earlier to ensure that a sufficient number of younger patients were included in the study.

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable, this was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Due to the nature of the study, no formal testing was planned and all tests and p-values were descriptive.

The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP:

- ­ The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients enrolled in the study.
- ­ All patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication and had a safety follow-up were included in the safety population.
- ­ All patients in the safety population who completed at least 18 weeks of treatment (and returned for an assessment in week 19), signifying that they had at least 3 Hb assessments during the evaluation period, were included in the completers population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ­ The Per-Protocol (PP) population includes all patients included in the safety population and who had no major protocol violations  (patients  with  less  than  3  Hb  values  during  the  evaluation period, patients who missed any administration of study medication at week 13 or week 17, patients who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria for Hb or iron levels, patients who fulfilled any of the exclusion criteria: hemoglobinopathies, hemolysis, overt gastrointestinal bleeding or RBC transfusion within 8 weeks before screening/during screening period)
- ­ The Extension Patients Population is defined as all patients having signed the informed consent for the optional safety extension period.

## Efficacy Analysis

The different Mircera conversion factor groups were summarized descriptively in an exploratory manner using summary statistics based on means, standard deviations and percentiles. Analyses were presented by dose group. The main subgroups of interest in this paediatric study were the age groups (based on age at study start, 5-11; 12-17 years) and previous ESA (epoetin alfa/beta; darbepoetin alfa), both of which were used for stratification.

The primary endpoint (change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods), and one secondary endpoint (change in reticulocyte count) were calculated on a per-patient basis, using an area under the curve (AUC) approach to calculate an individual's average for both the baseline and evaluation periods and taking the difference. The baseline period was defined as all assessments between the day of first study dose and the previous 20 days. The Hb value on the day of the first dose was included in the baseline calculation as this assessment was performed before the first dose was given. The average Hb value for each individual during the evaluation period was based on all values recorded on study days 111 to 138. For patients with no recorded Hb during the evaluation period, the primary endpoint was missing. No imputation was made for missing values. If an RBC transfusion occurred, Hb values  measured  in  the  following  3  weeks  were  excluded;  any  Hb  values  recorded  after  a  renal transplantation were censored.

The average Hb for the baseline and evaluation periods were used to classify each patient for the Hbbased secondary efficacy endpoints.

Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline covariate adjusted estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated from  an  Analysis  of  Covariance  (ANCOVA)  model.  The  model  contains  the  patient's  baseline  Hb  as covariate and dependent effects for dose group, age group and previous ESA group. The primary analysis of the study was based on the ITT population.

## PK and PD Analysis

Mircera PK parameters were derived from serum concentration versus time data obtained from blood sampling from seven time points following the third iv administration of Mircera at week 9. PK parameters were read directly from the serum concentration versus time profiles or were estimated from the serum concentrations  by  noncompartmental  methods  using  WinNonlin  software  (Phoenix  64,  Pharsight Corporation,  Mountain  View,  CA,  USA).  Actual  sampling  times  were  used  for  the  calculation  of  PK parameters, except for all pre-dose time points, which were set to zero.

## Results

## Participant flow

Figure 15. Patient disposition of study NH19707

<!-- image -->

A total of 112 patients were screened; of these 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2, following a preliminary analysis of Group 1). Among the 48 screening failures, 44 patients did not meet inclusion criteria, 3 patients did not sign ICF and 1 patient had a high likelihood of withdrawal (kidney transplantation planned).

Replacement of patients not completing at least 18 weeks of treatment lead to a total of 48 patients in Group 2, 12 more than the protocol specified minimum of 36. 12 patients in Group 1 and 35 in Group 2 completed the evaluation period. Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, and this optional safety extension was completed by 17 patients.

During the core study period, 4 patients in Group 1 (25%) and 13 in the Group 2 (27%) withdrew from treatment. The most frequently reported reason for withdrawal was renal transplant (4 patients in Group 1 and 9 patients in Group 2). Of the two 'other' reasons one was due to liver transplant, the other because the department moved to another hospital. One patient in Group 2 died during the core study period of intracranial hematoma, considered not related to study drug (Table 16).

During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent and a further two, at the same center, due to 'repair of the dialysis station').

## Baseline data

## Patient Demographics

Overall, there were 34 male patients (53%), with a higher representation in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (Table 17).

The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ± SD age was 11 ± 3.2 years in Group 1 and 13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly represented in Group 1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%). The youngest patient was 6 years old (see age distribution in Figure 16). The mean baseline body surface area (according to the Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.

Median Z scores for height and pre-dialysis weight were negative in both groups (height: -1.07 and 1.67,  respectively,  for  Group  1  and  Group  2;  weight  -0.87  and  -1.32,  respectively),  indicating,  as expected in this patient population, under-developed, underweight patients compared with children of the same sex and age.

n 1represents number of patients contributing to summary statistics.

Percentages are based on n (number of valid values).

* The Z-score provides a normalized score standardised by age and sex using the US CDC Growth Charts as reference.

A Z-score of 0 is average, a score outside of plus/minus 1, 2 or 3 is respectively more extreme then 68, 95 or 99 percent of values for the reference sex and age category.

## Previous ESA Therapy

The median time since first ESA administration was 22 months in Group 1 and 14 months in Group 2 (Table  19).  In  Group  1,  the  last  ESA  administered  prior  to  screening  was  darbepoetin  in  8  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(median weekly dose, 17.5 µg) and epoetin alfa/beta in 8 patients (median weekly dose, 4500 IU). In Group 2, the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 26 patients (median weekly dose, 20 µg) and epoetin alfa/beta in 22 patients (median weekly dose, 6000 IU). For the patients receiving  darbepoetin, most patients were receiving once-weekly administrations. For those patients receiving epoetin alfa/beta, most were dosed 2-3 times a week, which is in accordance with the posology authorized.

## Previous and Concurrent Diseases

## Aetiology of Chronic Kidney Disease

The  most  frequently  reported  aetiology  of  CKD  was  hereditary  nephropathy  (16  patients  overall), followed by hypoplastic/dysplastic kidneys (14 patients overall).

## Risk Factors for Vascular Events and Haemorrhage

A  total  of  32  patients  (50%)  had  reported  experiencing  arterial  hypertension  at  any  time  before enrolment, 6 patients (9%) had experienced venous thrombosis and 5 (8%) had experienced at least one haemorrhage event.

## Previous and Concomitant Treatments

Anticoagulation Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All patients had anticoagulation treatment prior to study start, with the most frequently used agents being heparin sodium (3 [19%] in Group 1 and 25 [52%] in Group 2) and enoxaparin sodium (11 [69%] in Group 1 and 16 [33%] in Group 2).

## Iron Supplementation

Most patients recorded receiving iron supplementation prior to study start (58 patients [91%]); during the  study,  including  the  safety  extension  period,  iron  supplementation  was  recorded  by  15  patients (94%) in Group 1 and 47 (98%) in Group 2. The most frequently used agents were iron sucrose, ferrous gluconate, and ferric hydroxide.

## Antihypertensive Agents

Using a classification based on selected coded medication classes, at study start, 37 (58%) patients were taking  or  had  taken  'antihypertensive  and/or  diuretic  agents',  the  most  common  categories  being angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  calcium  channel  blocking  agents  and  'beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. There were 38 patients recorded as taking at least one of these agents during the study.

## Other Treatments

Apart from surgical and medical procedures (all patients were on haemodialysis), anticoagulants and anti-anaemic agents, the most frequently used concomitant treatments were vitamins and minerals (15 [94%] in Group 1 and 44 [92%] in Group 2), of which vitamin D supplements were the top 3 treatments; calcium compounds and regulators (9 [56%] in Group 1 and 37 [77%] in Group 2) and supplements (11 [69%] in Group 1 and 30 [63%]in Group 2), of which the most frequently used were sodium bicarbonate and carnitine.

## Haemodialysis at Baseline

The median duration of haemodialysis at baseline was 1.3 years in Group 1 and just under 1 year in Group 2. Approximately 75% of patients had been on haemodialysis for under 2.2 years, and had dialysis treatment (i.e., possible previous peritoneal dialysis) for less than 4 years. The majority of patients in both  groups  had  three  haemodialysis  sessions  per  week.  Mean  ±  SD  Kt/V,  a  measure  of  dialysis adequacy, was 1.57 ± 0.377 in Group 1 and 1.60 ± 0.408 in Group 2 (a higher score indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 1.20 considered adequate). Mean ± SD urea reduction ratio, another measure of dialysis adequacy, was 79% ± 8.5% in Group 1 and 72% ± 9.0% in Group 2 (a higher percentage indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 65% considered adequate).

## Recruitment/Numbers analysed

All ITT patients (16 patients in Group 1 and 48 in Group 2, 64 patients overall) received at least one dose  of  the  treatment  and  were  included  in  the  safety  population.  Therefore,  the  ITT  and  safety population were the same.

The (core study period) completers population (patients completing at least 18 weeks of treatment with at least three Hb assessments during the evaluation period) comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 36 in Group 2. One patient dropped out at week 19, therefore was included in completers population but did not complete the evaluation period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PP population comprised the patients in the completers population with the exclusion of 2 additional patients in Group 2 who were protocol violators of the inclusion criterion regarding iron levels. The PP population thus comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 34 in Group 2.

In total, 37 patients signed the informed consent to enter the safety extension (9 from Group 1 and 28 from Group 2). In Group 1, one patient withdrew consent without receiving any study drug or performing any study procedures during the extension period.

## Conduct of Study

Five protocol amendments were issued. Of note, in the original protocol, the standard deviation of the Hb change from baseline used for the sample size calculation was assumed to be 1.5 g/dL. However, following the preliminary assessment of Group 2, the variability (standard deviation) of the data ranged from 1.9 to 2.1 g/dL. The assumed standard deviation was therefore increased to 2.0 g/dL and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sample size revised in Protocol Amendment D. The sample size, for the optimum dose group only, for the group to enrol additional patients, was increased to 36 patients (an additional 20 patients instead of 9 after the assessment of the initial 16 patients). It was also recommended at this time that patients that did not complete the core study period were to be replaced, as allowed per-protocol.

The protocol stated that for the primary analysis the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) was to be used to impute missing Hb values. However, since the protocol was developed, LOCF was no longer considered an appropriate method for dealing with missing values, partly because of concerns of underestimation of the variability. This, along with justification based on the specific case of this study (notably that the majority of missing values were due to early withdrawals for renal transplantation, which was not expected to be directly linked to a systematic decline [or increase] in Hb), led to the decision to change this method. No imputation was made for missing values in the primary analysis, and values after a RBC transfusion were excluded and not imputed. The analysis as specified in the protocol was performed as a sensitivity analysis.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

Change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 1721)

The changes from baseline to the evaluation period are summarized in the Table 23.

In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2), age (5-11/1218 years), previous ESA treatment (darbepoetin alfa/epoetin alfa or beta) and baseline Hb AUC, the adjusted mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -0.16) for Group 1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26) for Group 2 (Table 24). Terms from the model show no indication of a strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Group 2, mean Hb values remained above 10 g/dL and below 12 g/dL throughout the study. However, in the Group 1 there was a clear decrease in Hb levels during the titration period, with mean values dropping below 10 g/dL (Figure 17) and reaching a nadir at week 9 before increasing without returning to baseline levels at the start of the evaluation period. In both groups, there was a small increase in Hb at the beginning of the study from baseline to week 3, although mean levels remained below 12 g/dL with a mean increase from baseline of the order of 0.5 g/dL for Group 1 and less than 0.5 g/dL for Group 2 (see Figure 18). In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 17 at week 4, and 11 at week 5. 75% of patients were under 12.5 g/dL at week 4, and less than 1.75 g/dL from their baseline value. The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Patients With Haemoglobin 10-12 g/dL during Evaluation and With Change from Baseline ± 1 g/dL

During the evaluation period, in Group 2, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within ± 1 g/dL of baseline and 81% maintained Hb values within 10-12 g/dL (in Group 1, these figures were 58% and 75%, respectively) (Table 25). The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69% in Group 2 and 58% in Group 1.

For calculation of average Hb, AuC approach with following settings is applied: Values within 2l days after blood transfusion(s) are dropped.

Blood Transfusions during the Core Study Period

Three patients required blood transfusions during the core study period, one in Group 1 and two in Group 2 (Table 26). The reasons for transfusion were Hb decreased, procedural hemorrhage, and intracranial hematoma. The patient with intracranial hematoma died as a result of the event.

Reticulocyte Counts during the Core Study Period

In  both  groups,  mean  reticulocytes  showed  a  cyclic  variation  over  time,  with  peaks  at  week  2, subsequently every 4 weeks and with troughs at week 4 to 5 and subsequently every 4 weeks throughout the study but otherwise showed no overall tendency to increase or decrease.

## Ancillary analyses

## Exploratory analyses

## Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period

A summary of the equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose over time during the core study period is provided in Table 27.

Mean (±SD) 4-weekly Mircera dose increased from 66,64 (±47,348) µg (week 1-4) to 90,45 (±47,232) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 1, and decreased from 163,33 (±99,517) µg (week 1-4) to 161,42 (±123,065) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 2.

Median(Q1-Q3) 4-weekly Mircera dose increased from 58,3 (24,5-104,5) µg (week 1-4) to 79,2 (50,0124,0) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 1, and decreased from 147,8 (75,0-196,9) µg (week 1-4) to 117,1 (78,2-220,0) µg (last 4 weeks interval) in Group 2.

When considering the median values, which are less affected by outliers, in Group 2, the dose decreased slightly through to week 13 and then increased for the fifth and final dose at week 17. In Group 1, the median dose increased slowly throughout the core study, in response to the course of Hb over time.

## Dose ratio between first and evaluation period equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose

In  Group  2,  the  within-patient  change  in  the  4-weekly  Mircera  dose  during  the  evaluation  period compared to their first dose was in general small, as indicated by a median ratio of 1.0 and a mean ratio of 1.1. In the case of Group 1, this ratio was larger (median ratio, 1.6; mean ratio, 1.9).

Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period

The conversion factors for previously weekly ESA dose to equivalent weekly Mircera dose during the evaluation period are shown in Table 29.

In Group 2, the median [IQR] conversion factors were 1.8 [1.4, 2.8] for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 [0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close to the conversion factors used to calculate the first dose (1/0.55=1.8 and 1/125=0.008 for darbepoetin and epoetins respectively). The graphs show an even distribution either side of the line of these initial dose conversion factors (Figures 19 and 20).

## Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period

During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% of patients in Group 2 and 81% in Group 1 required a dose change) (Table 30). A lower proportion of patients in Group 2 compared to Group 1 required a dose increase only during the core study period (29% compared to 56%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 required no dose change (23%) compared with Group 1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases and increases (38%) compared with Group 1 (13%). In terms of absolute numbers of dose changes, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean number of dose increases and decreases was 1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2.

When considering the individual patient ratios of initial dose to dose during evaluation (Table 33) in Group 2, there was a small increase (1.25) in the medians in the 5-11 age group whereas the ratio was close to 1 in the 12-17 age group (0.98). In the younger age group, this corresponds to not more than one protocol specified dose change of 25%. In Group 1, the median ratios were both greater than 1 (1.81 for the 5-11 age group and 1.59 for the 12-17 age group). While absolute doses differ, results for changes in dose are generally reflected in the smaller Group 1 age subsets. Overall, for Group 1, dose increases were required and larger increases were seen in the younger patients and smaller increases in the older patients.

## Previous ESA treatment

In Group 1, 8 patients were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 8 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta. In Group 2, 26 were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 22 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

When considering changes in Hb over time in Group 2, the mean Hb change from baseline for patients previously on darbepoetin alfa was generally below baseline whereas the mean for patients previously taking epoetin alfa/beta remained closer to baseline throughout (Figure 22).

## Blood Transfusions

During the safety extension period, one patient required blood transfusion after transplant failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  NH19708:  phase  II,  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter  study  to ascertain the optimal starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously for the maintenance  treatment  of  anaemia  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on dialysis or not yet on dialysis.

## Methods

The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration (16 weeks), and evaluation (4 weeks). Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ±1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL, were eligible to enter an optional 24-week safety extension period. Mircera was administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels (according to dose adjustment predefined rules).

Once 12 patients had completed 20 weeks of treatment, an interim analysis to assess efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics was performed.

The starting dose was based on conversion factors (CFs) obtained from the dose-finding study (Study NH19707). The initial  dose of Mircera  was one of  nine  starting  doses  corresponding  to  the  prefilled syringe strengths based on the total weekly ESA dose during the screening period.

The dose of Mircera could be adjusted to maintain the individual patient's Hb within a target range of ± 1 g/dL of his or her baseline Hb and between 10.0 -12.0 g/dL. Dose adjustments were performed at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scheduled dosing days and was based on the Hb value measured on that day as shown in Table 37. The dose adjustments were not to be performed more often than once every 4 weeks.

All  treatments  (medications  and  medical  procedures)  were  permitted  before  screening,  during  the screening period and throughout the 20-weeks treatment period except for: investigational medicinal product, non-FDA and non-EMA approved biosimilar ESAs within 12 weeks of screening, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within 8 weeks before screening, or immunosuppressive therapies administered in the last 12 weeks before the first screening visit. Supplemental iron was administered to prevent iron deficiency during the screening period and during study, and to maintain adequate iron parameters.

## Objectives

Efficacy Objective: To ascertain the starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching from stable SC maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, or darbepoetin alfa.

Safety Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic  Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics  of  Mircera  in  patients  on  dialysis  or  not  yet  on  dialysis  who  receive  the  study medication by the SC route of administration.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

- -Change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline and the evaluation period for each patient.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

- -Number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb or above, within or below the range of 10-12 g/dL.
- -Change in Mircera  dose  over  time,  including  the  change  between  the  starting  dose  and  the evaluation period.

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics:

- -Serum concentrations of Mircera and Hb were used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Mircera through PK and PK/PD models.

## Safety:

- -Occurrence and severity of adverse events
- -Change from baseline in targeted vital signs
- -Change from baseline in targeted clinical laboratory test results

## Sample size

This study was designed to include 40 paediatric patients. It was planned to include approximately 1015 of the patients &lt;12 years old, with the objective to include as many patients as possible &lt;5 years old (with a minimum of 3 patients).

It  was  also  planned  to  include  approximately  10-15  patients,  irrespective  of  age,  who  were  not  on dialysis, and no more than 10 patients on HD.

This was an exploratory study without a powered statistical group comparison. Therefore, no formal sample  size  estimation  was  performed.  However,  the  calculations  below  mentioned  indicate  the approximate precision that could be achieved:

Assuming a 30% withdrawal rate (based on the withdrawal rate for the NH19707 study), of the 40 patients evaluable for ITT and safety analysis, more than 26 patients would have data for the evaluation period. Twenty-six patients would be sufficient to provide approximately 90% power that the 90% CI for  the  Hb  change  from  baseline  to  the  evaluation  period  is  between  -1  and  +1  g/dL,  provided  the standard deviation is smaller than 1.5 and the optimum dose conversion is able to maintain the Hb at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the baseline level. This means that we assume there will be no change in the Hb levels from baseline to the evaluation period.

To achieve the recruitment of the intended number of patients and in case of excessive dropout rate, additional patients were planned to be enrolled to replace patients not treated for a minimum duration of 18 weeks.

## Randomisation

No randomization was performed.

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable, this was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

All efficacy variables (original values and change from baseline) over time are presented in summary tables and graphically. The estimates are summarized descriptively using means, standard deviations, and percentiles.

The analysis population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses is the ITT population consisting of all enrolled patients.

An  additional  analysis  would  be  performed  based  on  the  per-protocol  population,  which  would  be precisely  defined  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan,  before  database  closure,  as  the  subset  of  the  ITT population without major protocol deviations.

Safety data for the whole study including the safety extension period is presented. The safety analysis population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug regardless of whether they withdrew prematurely or not.

Mircera serum concentration-time data would be described using non-linear mixed effect modelling. The previously developed model was a one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination processes. It will be updated with Study NH19708 data.

## Analysis Populations

The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP:

- -Intent to Treat (ITT) Population. The ITT population consisted of all patients enrolled in the study.
- -Per-Protocol (PP) Population. The PP population was defined as all patients included in the safety population and who have no major protocol deviations as defined below:
1. Patients with less than 3 Hb values during the evaluation period.
2. Patients who miss any application of study medication at week 13 or week 17.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Patients with an overdose of Mircera at week 17 captured as a protocol deviation
4. Patient with wrong Mircera starting dose

5. Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for: haemoglobin, iron levels, stable dose and dosing interval of SC treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or biosimilars, or darbepoetin alfa.

6.  Patients  who  fulfil  any  of  the  exclusion  criteria:  Haemolytic  anaemia  or  use  of  prohibited therapy.

- -Safety Population. The safety analysis population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug regardless of whether they withdrew prematurely or not.

A total of 62 patients were screened, 34 patients were enrolled after initial screening and 28 patients failed the screening. Among the 28 screen failure patients, 7 patients were re-screened, 6 patients were enrolled, and 1 patient failed the re-screening.

A total of 40 patients (100%) were enrolled in the core period of the study from 20 centres distributed across 7 countries.

The majority of patients (38 patients [95%]) completed and 2 patients (5%) discontinued during the core period. The reasons for discontinuation from the core period were kidney transplant (1 patient [2.5%]) and use of prohibited medication (1 patient [2.5%]).

A total of 38 patients completed the core period; of these, 25 eligible patients (62.5%) opted to enter the safety extension period. Of the 13 patients who did not enter the safety extension, 7 would have been eligible based on Hb within 10-12 g/dL and ±1 g/dL of the baseline value. The majority of the patients entering the safety extension have completed this period (21 of 25 patients), and 4 patients had discontinued. The only reason for discontinuation of patients from the safety extension period was kidney transplant (4 patients).

## Recruitment/Numbers analysed

All ITT patients (40 patients) received at least one dose of the treatment and were included in the safety population. Therefore, the ITT and safety population were the same.

In the PP population, 33 patients were included and 7 patients were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion of patients from the PP population were overdose of Mircera at Week 17 (2 patients) and treatment with prohibited concomitant medication (2 patients).

All 25 patients who entered the optional safety extension period of the study were included in the safety extension population.

To meet the target patient population, no replacement of patients was required to complete the targeted sample size in the study.

## Baseline data

The  patients'  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  consistent  with  the  target  patient population. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the ITT population is included below (Table 40).

The mean (±SD) weight and height of patients at baseline was 34.21 (21.04) kg and 126.74 (32.95) cms, respectively. The median Z-score was negative for both weight (-1.2) and height (-1.6), indicating that the patient population had lower weight and height than the normal population for the same age and sex, which is as expected in this patient population with anaemia of CKD.

A similar proportion of patients were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta were enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with previous ESA).

Overall, there were 23 male patients (57,5%). The majority of patients were caucasian (30 patients, 75%), and the mean ± SD age was 10.32 ± 5.69 years. The graphical distribution of patients among age categories (Figure 25) (&lt;5, 511, ≥12 years) is presented below. 12 patients (30%) were younger than 5 years old, 4 of them between 0-2 years old.

There were 18 patients (45%) who were on peritoneal dialysis, 17 patients (42.5%) who were not on dialysis, and 5 patients (12.5%) who were on haemodialysis. The number of patients on haemodialysis was comparatively lower than the number of patients not on dialysis or on peritoneal dialysis. This was because to be eligible for enrolment in this Study NH19708, these patients had to previously receive their ESA treatment SC.

The mean (±SD) weight and height of patients at baseline was 34.21 (21.04) kg and 126.74 (32.95) cms, respectively. The median Z-score was negative for both weight (-1.2) and height (-1.6), indicating that the patient population had lower weight and height than the normal population for the same age and sex, which is as expected in this patient population with anaemia of CKD.

A similar proportion of patients were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta were enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with each previous ESA).

## Previous ESA Therapy

A similar proportion of patients that were previously treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta were enrolled (20 patients [50%] treated with each previous ESA).

The last median (min-max) weekly epoetin alfa/beta dose before administering the first Mircera dose was 2000 IU (range: 375-8000 IU). The majority of patients (60%) received epoetin alfa/beta at a frequency of once a week (8 patients [40%]) or twice a week (4 patients [20%]).

The last median (min-max) weekly darbepoetin alfa dose before administering the first Mircera dose was 10 µ g (range: 2.5-50 µ g). Nine patients (45%) received darbepoetin alfa at a frequency of once every two weeks.

## Previous and Concurrent Diseases

## Aetiology of Chronic Kidney Disease

The  most  frequent  ( ≥ 10%  patients)  nephrological  diseases  were  hypoplastic/dysplastic  kidneys  (12 patients  [30%]),  reflux  nephropathy  (7  patients  [17.5%]),  and  hereditary  nephropathy  (5  patients [12.5%]).

## Risk Factors for Vascular Events and Haemorrhage

Twelve patients (30%) had at least one of the risk factors for vascular events and haemorrhage at or before enrolment. Arterial hypertension was the only predominant risk factor reported in 10 patients (25%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Previous and Concomitant Treatments

All patients (40 patients) were receiving at least one previous treatment at baseline. Previous treatments by class taken by ≥ 30% of patients were Vitamin D and analogues (27 patients [67.5%]), calcium (21 patients [52.5%]), folic acid and derivatives (18 patients [45%]), iron bivalent, oral preparations (16 patients [40%]), iron trivalent, oral preparations and ACE inhibitors (15 patients [37.5%]), antacids with sodium  bicarbonate  and  drugs  for  treatment  of  hyperkalemia  and  hyperphosphatemia  (13  patients [32.5%]), and dihydropyridine derivatives (12 patients [30%]).

All  patients  (40  patients)  continued  receiving  at  least  one  concomitant  treatment  during  the  study including the extension period. The concomitant treatment classes taken by ≥ 30% of patients were Vitamin D and analogues (29 patients [72.5%]), calcium (22 patients [55%]), folic acid and derivatives (19 patients [47.5%]), ACE inhibitors (18 patients [45%]), iron bivalent, oral preparations and iron trivalent, oral preparations (17 patients [42.5%] in each class), drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia (16 patients  [40%] in  each  class),  dihydropyridine  derivatives  (13  patients [32.5%]), antibiotics and antacids with sodium bicarbonate and other antipsoriatics for topical use (14 patients [35%] in each class), somatropin and somatropin agonists and sulfonamides (12 patients [30%] in each class).

## Anticoagulation Treatment

Two patients (5%) were receiving anticoagulation treatment at baseline and continued to receive it during  the  study.  One  patient  received  enoxaparin  sodium  and  another  patient  received  nadroparin calcium.

## Iron Supplementation

A majority of patients (35 patients [87.5%]) were receiving iron supplementation at baseline. Most enrolled  patients  (36  patients  [90.0%])  continued  receiving  iron  supplementation  during  the  study including the extension period

## Outcomes and estimation

Primary efficacy endpoint: Change in Hb concentration (g/dl) between the baseline and the evaluation period

During the evaluation period (weeks 17-21), the data was evaluable for 38 patients. The mean (±SD) change in Hb concentration level during the evaluation period showed a 0.48 (1.03) g/dL increase above the baseline level. The 90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within the protocol specified range of ±1,1 g/dL and the SD was &lt;1.5 g/dL.

The mean Hb concentration level was maintained within the targeted range of 10-12 g/dL and the mean change  in  Hb  level  was  within ± 1  g/dL  of  the  baseline  Hb  levels.  At  all-time  points,  the  mean  Hb concentration levels showed an increase above the baseline levels.

A total of 3 patients out of the 40 enrolled patients were excluded from the analysis of change in mean Hb concentration levels at Weeks 17 and 19:

- -At Week 17, two patients had discontinued the study and one patient underwent RBC transfusion within the previous 3 Weeks of the scheduled visit at Week 17.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -At Week 19, along with the 2 discontinued patients, one patient had missed the visit scheduled at Week 19.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Patients with Mean Hb within 10-12 g/dL and Change from Baseline within ±1 g/dL during Evaluation Period

During the evaluation period, the data was evaluable for 38 patients (Table 46). The numbers of patients who had maintained mean Hb concentration level during the evaluation period were as follows:

- -24 patients (63.2%) within the range of 10-12 g/dL,
- -19 patients (50%) within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and
- -18 patients (47.4%) within both the ranges of 10-12 g/dL and ± 1  g/dL  of  the  baseline  Hb concentration levels.

During the evaluation period, few patients had mean Hb concentration levels below 10 g/dL (2 patients [5.3%]) or more than 1 g/dL below the baseline mean Hb level (4 patients [10.5%]). There were 15 patients (39.5%) who had mean Hb concentration levels more than 1 g/dL above the baseline level and 12 patients (31.6%) had mean Hb level above 12 g/dL.

## Mircera dose over time

Overall, the Mircera dose was decreased over time from the starting dose at Week 1 until Week 17. The median was considered for reporting Mircera dose.

Ratio Mircera Dose: Overall, the median (min-max) ratio of starting dose (Week 1) to the dose at the Week 17 was 1.44 (range: 0.2 -3.8), indicating that the Mircera dose was decreased over the course of the core study period. Patients who were not administered a Mircera dose at Week 17 visit due to the applicable dose adjustment rules were excluded from the ratio computation. There were 5 such patients; therefore, at Week 17, the data of 33 patients were available for calculation of the median ratio of Mircera dose.

Mircera Dose in core period: The median (min-max) Mircera dose at Week 1 was 75 µ g (range: 15-360 µ g) and it was 50 µ g (range: 0-250 µ g) at Week 17. This was a median (min-max) decrease by 20 µ g ( -250.0 - 120 µ g) compared to the starting dose at Week 1 (Table 49). All patients received a median of 5 doses (range: 1-5) of Mircera. The median Mircera dose was 67 µ g over a median duration of 16.14 weeks (range: 0.1-18.3 weeks).

By body weight and by surface area at Week 17, the median (min-max) Mircera dose decreased by -0.81 µ g/kg (range: -6.3-3.8 µ g/kg) and by -20.30 µ g/ m2 (range: -182.6-110.4) compared to the starting dose at Week 1, respectively.

## Patients with dose adjustments

Mircera dose adjustments (increase, decrease, or both) were made for the majority of the patients (34 patients [85%]) during the core period. Five patients (12.5%) did not require any adjustment in their Mircera dose. For most of the patients, Mircera dose was decreased (25 patients [62.5%]). The Mircera dose was increased in 7 patients (17.5%). The predominant reason for these dose modifications was as per  protocol  (33  patients  [82.5%]),  which  allowed  the  Mircera  dose  adjustments  to  maintain  the individual patient's Hb concentration levels within a target range of 10 -12 g/dL or within ± 1 g/dL of baseline Hb levels. 2 (5%) dose modification was due to a medication error and 3 (7,5%) due to physician decision.

## Ancillary analyses

## Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses by the key stratification factors age group (&lt;5, 511, ≥12 years), dialysis status at the start of the study (no dialysis, PD or HD), and previous ESA treatment (epoetin [alfa or beta] or darbepoetin alpha) were performed.

## Age group (&lt;5, 511, ≥12 years)

Mircera dose over time

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median (min-max) Mircera dose at Week 1 was 75 µ g (range: 15-360 µ g) and it was 50 µ g (range: 10.0-560.0 µ g) at Week 41. This was a median (min-max) decrease by -25 µ g ( -150.0-200.0 µ g) at Week 41 compared to Week 1.

## Dose adjustments

During the safety extension period, Mircera dose adjustments (increase, decrease, or both) were made in majority of the patients (18 patients [72%]). Seven patients (28%) did not require any dose change. Mircera dose increase as well as decrease were made in 10 patients (40%). Six patients (24%) had dose decrease only, and 2 patients (8%) had dose increase only (Table 59).

## Patient-reported outcomes

## Injection pain

5 minutes following ESA administration was assessed using a VAS scale at screening (both visits) when the  patients  were  on  previous  ESA  treatment  (darbepoetin  alfa  or  epoetin  alfa/beta)  and  after transitioning to Mircera treatment at Week 1 (Visit 3) and at Week 9 (Visit 6).

A plot of mean ( ± SD) pain score over time by nurse's, patient's and parent's assessment indicated a higher  injection  pain  scores  during  screening  while  the  patients  were  on  treatment  with  previous darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa/beta compared to treatment with Mircera at both injection time points at Week 1 and Week 9.

## MH40258 -Real world evidence of safety and dosing of Mircera in children with chronic kidney disease

This is a non-interventional study secondary data use (NIS SDU) and voluntary post-authorization safety study (PASS) of paediatric patients from the two existing registries within the International Paediatric Dialysis Network (IPDN): International Paediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) and International Paediatric  Haemodialysis  Network  (IPHN)  registries.  The  registries  collect  prospective  (baseline  and every 6 months) information from paediatric PD and HD centers worldwide.

The data collection periods for this study were from 2007 through Q2 2021 for IPPN and from 2013 through Q2 2021 for IPHN.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study aims to further characterize safety, dosing and related Hb concentrations and to validate the dose simulation models of Mircera in paediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) with anaemia due to CKD in a real-world setting.

Patients aged 0 months to &lt;18 years at initial Mircera visit, on chronic PD or HD were included.

A total of 229 paediatric dialysis patients (177 PD, 52 HD) receiving Mircera were analysed in this study. The median age at first visit was 10.6 (interquartile range 4.2-14.6) years for the PD and 14.1 (10.416.2) years for the HD cohort, respectively. The median observation time under Mircera exposure was 6.1 (0-12.5) months and 11.9 (0-17.9) months for the PD and HD patients, respectively. More than PD patients 50% were from Europe, and almost all HD patients were from Europe (96,2%).

## Safety results- hospitalizations events and deaths

The safety of Mircera was assessed by aggregate analysis of the hospitalization events and deaths during exposure to the drug. Hospitalizations and deaths were monitored from 6 months before the first visit under Mircera until the last visit under Mircera or, if available, for 6 months after the last visit with reported Mircera exposure.

During a median observation time of 13.5 months, 121 (68.4%) PD patients under Mircera had at least one hospitalization while using Mircera. There were 5 (2.8%) deaths observed in the PD cohort under Mircera. 121 (68.4%) PD patients had at least one hospitalization while using Mircera and a total of 370 hospitalizations occurred during 270 observation years (calculated as mean observation time * number of patients), i.e., 1.37 per year of observation. 77% of the hospitalizations (1.03 per year) were nonelective. Infections (thereof 56% PD-related) accounted for 85/277 (31%), non-elective PD technique complications  for  37/277  (14%),  and  cardiovascular,  fluid  and  electrolyte  complications  for  62/277 (23%) of the non-elective hospitalizations. The latter included 18 admissions for hypertensive crisis in 14 patients.

A  total  of  6  hospitalizations  in  three  patients  were  related  to  anaemia,  including  two  transfusions performed in one patient and two episodes of bleeding in another patient. No episodes of thrombotic or thromboembolic events were reported in any of the children undergoing PD.

In the HD cohort, 36 patients (69.2%) had 132 hospitalizations during 83.6 observation years while using Mircera, corresponding to a rate of 1.58 hospitalization events per year of observation. 106/132 (80%) of these hospitalizations (1.27 per year) were non-elective. 43/106 (41%) of the non-elective hospitalization events were due to HD technique complications, 30/106 (28%) to infections, and 16/106 (15%)  to  cardiovascular/fluid  imbalance  events.  10  admissions  in  seven  patients  were  due  to hypertensive crises. No  access-unrelated thrombotic or  thromboembolic  events  and  no  blood transfusions were reported.

Five children in the PD cohort and 2 of the children undergoing HD died while receiving Mircera (i.e. 3% of the total population), corresponding to an overall mortality rate of 19.8 cases per 1000 observation years.  The  causes  of  death  included  infections  (n=2),  intracranial  bleeding  (n=2),  congestive  heart failure (n=2), and one case of sudden death at home.

## Haemoglobin concentration and Mircera dose

The mean (SD) Hb level was 11.0 (1.9) g/dL at first observation and 10.9 (1.7) g/dL at last observation under Mircera in the PD cohort, and 10.2 (1.6) g/dL at first and 10.4 (1.7) g/dL at last observation under Mircera in the HD group. In both cohorts, Hb levels were stable over time and did not differ by age group. At last observation, 46.9% of the children on PD and 48.1% of those on HD had a Hb value in the target range of 10-12 g/dL, while 24.9% of PD and 13.5% of HD displayed higher and 28.2% of PD and 38.5% of HD patients lower Hb levels.

In the PD cohort the median (Q1, Q3) Mircera monthly dose at first visit was 100 (50, 120) μg, 3.4 (2.3, 5.4) μg/kg body weight, or 94 (67, 144) μg/m2 body surface area, and at last visit 100 (50, 150) μg, 3.5 (2.3, 5.1) μg/kg, or 95 (62, 145) μg/ m2. In the HD cohort, the median monthly Mircera dose at first visit was 107 (80, 129) μg, 2.9 (1.7, 4.0) μg/kg, or 89 (59, 115) μg/m2, and at last visit 80 (54, 129) μg, 2.1 (1.2, 3.4) μg/kg, or 63 (40, 98) μg/m2.

In general, the absolute monthly Mircera dose increased with age. At the first visit, in the PD cohort, it changed from median (interquartile range) 30 (30100) μg in infants younger than 2 years to 114 (75 -161) μg in the adolescent age group. In the HD cohort it changed from median (interquartil e range) 91 (54129) μg in children 2 to &lt;5 -year-old to 107 (80129) μg in the adolescent age group. At the last visit, in the PD cohort, it changed from median (interquartile range) 50 (30100) μg in infants younger than 2 years to 146 (78170) μg in the adolescent age group. In the HD cohort it changed from median (interquartile range) 91 (54129) μg in 2 children 2 to &lt;5 -year-old to 80 (54129) μg in the adolescent age group.

While absolute Mircera doses increased with age, the weight-related doses decreased substantially with increasing body size in both cohorts. In the children on PD aged &lt;2, 2-&lt;5, 5-&lt;12 and 12-&lt;18 years, the median Mircera monthly dose was 7.9 (4.9, 11.6), 5.4 (3.0, 7.5), 3.2 (2.7, 4.9) and 2.6 (1.9, 3.9) μg/kg at first observation and 5.1 (3.4, 9.8), 5.2 (2.7, 6.9), 3.0 (2.3, 4.7) and 3.0 (1.7, 4.5) μg/kg at last observation. In children on HD aged 2-&lt;5, 5-&lt;12 and 12-&lt;18 years, the median monthly dose was 6.5 (4.5, 8.6), 4.0 (3.2, 4.9), and 2.2 (1.3, 3.0) μg/kg at first observation and 6.5 (4.5, 8.6), 2.9 (2.1, 4.0), and 1.5 (0.9, 2.4) μg/kg at last observation, respectively.

The age-related dosing differences were smaller when doses were normalized to body surface area rather than body weight, with median doses at last visit of 114 (69, 218), 121 (69, 166), 87 (62, 120) and 98 (59, 145) μg/m2/month at &lt;2, 2 -&lt;5, 5-&lt;12 and 12-&lt;18 years in the PD cohort and 155 (100, 211), 83 (59, 104) and 53 (35, 81) μg/m2/month at 2 -&lt;5, 5-&lt;12 and 12-&lt;18 years in the HD group.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This application is an extension of indication to include treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  from  3  months  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  on  ESA  maintenance treatment. Mircera is already approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients and, according to the SmPC, can be used both in adult patients not currently treated with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) and in those currently treated with an ESA (epoetins or dabepoetin).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Epoetins  and  darbepoetin  are  usually  given  on  a  weekly  basis  while  Mircera  is  proposed  to  be administered every 4 weeks. This, in principle, could be considered an advantage for patients.

In the clinical development, a paediatric formulation has not been developed, as indicated in the agreed PIP. The formulation and strengths used in the paediatric studies supporting this extension of indication were those authorised for adults (solution for injection in single-use pre-filled syringes and a number of different strengths). The MAH has provided data to support that few patients included in the clinical studies received doses below 30 mcg. Due to the rarity of CKD in paediatric patients, it is agreed that few patients would have an uncovered need. Furthermore, taking into account the therapeutic indication requested (ESA conversion), and the fact that other ESAs are also authorised in vials, this question has not been further pursued. Nevertheless, as Mircera is manufactured in pre-filled syringes and partial doses should not be administered due to the risk of medication errors, this has been properly reflected in the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 6.6.

The efficacy of Mircera is based on extrapolation from data adults and on 2 dose finding studies (NH19707 and  NH19708).  Supportive  data  from  a  non-interventional  study  has  also  been  provided  (study MH40258). Overall, the extrapolation concept is acceptable considering the availability of PK data in children  compared  to  adults,  the  data  in  adults  from  adequate  and  controlled  trials  and  that  the physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children.

Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population  (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on haemodialysis,  following  iv  administration  of  Mircera  after  switching  from  other  ESAs  (i.e.,  epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration and continued 4 weeks more during the evaluation period.

This study was exploratory without a powered statistical group comparison.

The main objective was to determine the optimum starting dose of Mircera in paediatric patients with CKD on haemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with other ESA.

The protocol included two different groups with different conversion factors based on their previous ESA dose  to  find  the  optimum  Mircera  starting  dose.  Group  1  comprised  patients  who  started  with  an intermediate conversion factor dose. In the adaptive design, this starting dose was assessed. A group 2 was enrolled for treatment with a higher conversion factor dose, double than that of group 1. Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period. During this period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  with  Hb  concentration measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks).

A total of 112 patients were screened. Of these, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in group 2). The mean age was 11 and 13 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Children recruited in Group 2 were a bit older. The number of patients between 5 to 11 years of age was greater in group 1 than in group 2 with a low representation of patients younger than 8 years of age (3 and 2 patients &lt;8 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the evaluation phase, 4 patients in Group 1 and 13 in Group 2 withdrew from treatment due to renal transplant. The MAH replaced these patients with new ones in order to maintain the sample size planned at the beginning of the study. Baseline characteristics of patients who withdrew and replaced patients were similar. Replacement is agreeable taking into account the single-arm study design. Twelve patients in group 1 and 35 patients in group 2 completed the evaluation period. Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, which was completed by 17 patients.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 17-21). Only results for group 2 were presented, as this was the dose conversion factor, proposed also for study NH19708.

In study NH19707, the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was -0.09 g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) in group 2. During the evaluation period, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 81% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69%. During the core phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL. IV Mircera  dose  changes  occurred  frequently  (77%  of  patients  in  Group  2),  as  expected  for  patients receiving ESA.

Twenty-eight patients entered the extension study. Overall, the mean dose of Mircera was maintained stable  within  the  Hb  range.  These  results  should  be  considered  with  caution  as  there  was  a  high withdrawal rate.

Avoiding/reducing number of transfusions is a relevant goal of the treatment with ESAs. In this study 3 patients needed blood transfusions, one in Group 1 and 2 in Group 2, due to Hb reduction, procedural haemorrhage and intracranial hematoma. Due to the single arm design of the study it is not possible to interpret this data.

Study NH19708 was a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to ascertain the starting  dose  of  Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  3  months-17  years  paediatric  patients  with  CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or dabepoetin alfa.

The main objective was to ascertain the starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients with CKD on dialysis or not yet on dialysis when switching from stable SC maintenance treatment with other ESA.

The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration (16 weeks), and evaluation (4 weeks). Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ±1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL, were eligible to enter an optional 24-week safety extension period. Mircera was administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels. The starting dose was based on conversion factors obtained from the dose-finding study (group 2, Study NH19707).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In both studies patients had to be receiving maintenance treatment with ESA therapy at least 8 weeks before enrolment with no weekly dose change &gt; 25% (increase or decrease) for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of Mircera, IV or SC for studies NH19707 and NH19708, respectively.

Overall, 64 patients were screened and 40 of them were enrolled. The majority of patients completed (95%), and 2 patients discontinued during the core period; the reason for discontinuation were kidney transplant  and  use  of  prohibited  medication.  25  eligible  patients  (62.5%)  opted  to  enter  the  safety extension period. Of the 13 patients who did not enter the safety extension, 7 would have been eligible.

Mean age of patients included in study NH19708 was 10.2 years. Twelve (30% patients) were &lt; 5 years, 11 (27.5%) 5-11 years, and 17 patients 12-17 years. A minimum enrolment of 10 patients below 5 years was considered of interest by the PDCO to provide the needed PK data.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 17-21). The mean change (±SD) in Hb concentration level during the evaluation period for study NH19708 showed a 0.48 (1.03) g/dL increase above the baseline level. The 90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within the protocol specified range of ±1.1 g/dL and the SD was &lt;1.5 g/dL.

During the evaluation period, 50% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 63.2% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 47.4%.

During the evaluation phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL. The mean dose was decreased over time approximately by 30%. Furthermore, 62.5% of patients had dose decreases only, and a considerable number of patients had an Hb value above  the  target  range  (31.6%).  Although  dose  adjustments  are  considered  common  during  ESA therapy, results from study NH19708 suggested the conversion factor proposed might not be adequate for the switch to the SC route and that the Mircera dose could be too high.

Theoretical safety concerns have been raised following the SC to SC switch (AEs related to high Hb levels), and the popPK model was updated. Uncertainties of differences in paediatric SC bioavailability between other ESAs have been described, and these differences may have an impact on the apparently too high initial Mircera SC dose. Results from an additional analysis showed that the high PK and PD variability for Mircera lead to an overlap on PD outcomes considering or not differences in bioavailability between ESAs. However, due to the limitations on the PK/PD model, these results are considered rather limited. For practical reasons the high conversion factor for IV to IV and SC to SC switch was the MAH's preferred option, which is acknowledged by the CHMP. However, taking into account that a substantial percentage of patients in the SC to SC switch had Hb levels above the upper limit of the accepted range, and the potential AEs related to too high Hb levels, the intermediate conversion factor is considered more appropriate by the CHMP. Also, this is not expected to affect efficacy due to frequent monitoring is still required for these patients, and Mircera dose can be titrated.

Subgroup analysis, in general, are aligned with primary efficacy results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The efficacy of  Mircera  is  based  on  extrapolation  from  data  in  adults  and  on  2  dose  finding  studies (NH19707 and NH19708). Supportive  data  from  a  non-interventional  study  has  also  been  provided (study  MH40258).  Overall,  the  extrapolation  is  acceptable  considering  the  availability  of  PK  data  in children  compared  to  adults,  the  data  in  adults  from  adequate  and  controlled  trials  and  that  the physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children.

For study NH19707 in which patients on haemodialysis were switched from IV ESA to Mircera IV route efficacy results show that mean Hb concentration level remained stable during the evaluation period. These results support the proposed posology as well as the possibility to switch to IV Mircera paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age on haemodialysis who are stabilised with an ESA.

Results from study NH19708 in which patients were switched from stable SC maintenance treatment with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta,  or  darbepoetin  alfa  to  Mircera  SC  route  support  the  SC  use  in  the paediatric population (3 months to 17 years of age).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

ESA  therapy  is  an  established  treatment  option  for  alleviate  signs  and  symptoms  associated  with anaemia in patients with CKD. However, ESA therapy has been associated with risks, including pure red cell aplasia, stroke, vascular access loss and hypertension. In clinical trials, an increased risk of death, serious  cardiovascular  events  including  thrombosis  or  cerebrovascular  events  including  stroke  was observed when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl.

The primary safety information in paediatric patients is derived from studies NH19707 and NH19708, that  included  patients  5-17  years  old  with  clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anaemia  on  haemodialysis treatment and patients 3 months-17 years paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dialysis, respectively. Patients included in both studies were receiving maintenance treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) prior to switching to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera).

The duration of core period study was 20 weeks and 23 weeks for studies NH19707 and NH19708, respectively. Patients completing the core period with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week and 24-week safety extension period, respectively.

After the first administration of Mircera, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week during the core study period and once every four weeks during the safety extension.

The clinical safety of Mircera in paediatric patients is further supported by analysis of post-marketing adverse event (AE) reports and data from international registries recording use of Mircera in paediatric patients as well as reports of paediatric Mircera use in the literature.

During the core study period, the median cumulative total dose of Mircera was 466 µg in the Group 2 and 207 µg in the Group 1. The highest single, individually injected dose was 560 µg received by patient 3504, equivalent to 11.4 µg/kg with a total cumulative dose of 1950 µg. The highest cumulative dose was 2000 µg, from patient 6603, who regularly received 450 µg or 9 µg/kg.

Throughout  the  entire study (including the safety extension  period),  the  median  number  of administrations was 5.5 in Group 1 and 7.5 in Group 2. Four patients in Group 1 (25%) and 7 patients in Group 2 (15%) received at least 18 administrations and one in Group 2 received 19.

## Study NH19708

A total of 40 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera in this study. The extent of exposure (core study and safety extension) is summarized in Table 61.

Overall, the patients received a median of 5 Mircera administrations (range: 1-5 administrations) during the core period. The majority of patients (38 patients [95%]) received at least 5 Mircera administrations.

The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  &gt;  15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and infestations (30/64 patients overall [47%]), General disorders and administration site conditions (12/64 patients  [19%]),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/64  patients  overall  [19%])  and  Nervous  system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]).

The individual AEs reported in more than 5% of patients overall were nasopharyngitis (9/64 patients overall [14%]), headache (9/64 [14%]), vomiting (6/64 patients [9%]), hypertension (8/64 patients overall  [13%]),  abdominal  pain  (4/64  patients  overall  [6%]),  and  bronchitis  (4/64  patients  overall [6%]).

Adverse events with a frequency ≥ 2% by SOC during the core period is shown in Table 63. Most of the AEs were associated with CKD, other previous and concurrent risk factors/diseases and treatments, and/or dialysis-induced, and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug.

Seven AEs in  5/64  patients  (8%)  overall  (1  AE  [decreased  Hb]  in  1  patient  in  Group  1  and  6  AEs [arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, extensive interdialytic weight gain, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, dental caries, thrombosis in device] in 4 patients in Group 2) were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

Overall,  there  were  2  life-threatening  AEs  (both  in  group  2,  intracranial  hematoma  and  procedural haemorrhage, not related with treatment) and 10 severe AEs in 7/64 patients (11%), 4 of which were not classified as SAEs during the core study period. Of the remaining AEs, there were 42 moderate AEs in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients (55%).

The only severe AE to be reported more than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2 patients, 1 in each group). One of these cases was classified as an SAE, and both were considered related to the study drug by the investigator. The only other severe AE considered related to the study drug by the investigator were hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia.

Sewere AEs include life thncatening AEs.

TT = Trial Treatment

The most frequently reported events were Infections and infestations (17 patients overall [46%] had an AE in this SOC) and Gastrointestinal disorders (8 patients [22%]).

The most frequently reported individual AEs overall were headache (6 [16%]), hypertension (5 [14%]) and nasopharyngitis (7 [19%]).

Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: anaemia and urinary tract infection.

Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension period (all  in  patients  in  Group  2).  These  events  were  hypotension,  hypertension,  arteriovenous  fistula thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

## Study NH19708

## Core period

A majority of patients (32 patients [80%]) experienced at least one AE (Table 65). A total of 106 AEs were reported during the core period. A total of 13 patients (32.5%) experienced SAEs; however, none of these SAEs was considered related to Mircera treatment by the investigator and none resulted in withdrawal or dose modification/interruption. No deaths were reported.

AEs of severe intensity were reported in 6 patients (15%). Two patients (5%) each reported related AEs and AEs leading to dose modification/interruption. One patient required blood transfusion (2.5%).

The SOCs in which AEs were experienced by ≥ 15% patients were Infections and infestations (25 patients [62.5%]),  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  and  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal disorders  (7  patients  [17.5%]  in  each  SOC),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  and  General  disorders  and administration site conditions (6 patients [15%] in each SOC).

The most frequent AEs experienced by ≥ 5% patients were upper respiratory tract infection (5 patients [12.5%]),  accidental  overdose  (4  patients  [10%]),  oropharyngeal  pain,  pyrexia,  gastroenteritis, peritonitis  (3  patients  [7.5%]  in  each  PT),  and  anaemia,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  bronchitis, conjunctivitis,  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  hyperphosphataemia,  headache,  and  hypertension  (2 patients [5%] in each PT).

A total of 4 patients were reported with accidental overdoses in the study. Two accidental overdoses were because of an issue with the functioning of IXRS system. The remaining two accidental overdoses were due to medical error and did not exceed 25% of the dose that should have been administered. In all 4 patients the Mircera dose was corrected at the next visit and the overdosing had no safety impact.

During the core period, two patients experienced 3 AEs of administration site pain and ecchymosis (1 patient [2.5]), and injection site pain (1 patient [2.5%]) considered to be related to Mircera by the investigator.

Investigator text for AEs is coded using MedDRA wersion 24.0.

Percentages are based on N in the column headings. For frequency counts by preferred term, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted only once. For frequency counts of \"lotal mumber of events\" rows, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual ane counted separately. Includes HEs with onset from first dose of study drug to date of last contact or 28 days after last dose of study drug.

Percentages are based on N in the column headings. For frequency counts by preferred term, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted only once. For frequency counts of \"Total mumber of events\" rows, multiple oceurrences of the same NE in an individual are counted separately.

Includes AEs with onset from first dose of study drug to date of last contact or 28 days after last dose of study drug.

The majority of patients (25 patients [62.5%]) experienced AEs of WHO Grade 1-2. The AEs of WHO Grade 3-4 was experienced by 6 patients (15%): 2 patients (5%) experienced Grade 3 AEs and 4 patients (10%) experienced Grade 4 AEs.

Two patients experienced a total of 3 Grade 3 SAEs of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis (1 patient [2.5%]), and peritonitis and device malfunction (1 patient [2.5%]). All 3 SAEs were considered unrelated to Mircera by the investigator and had resolved.

Four  patients  experienced  a  total  of  4  Grade  4  SAEs  of  gastroenteritis,  appendicitis,  anaemia postoperative, and pneumonia (1 patient [2.5%] in each PT). All 4 SAEs were considered unrelated to Mircera by the investigator. Except for gastroenteritis, all the remaining Grade 4 AEs had resolved by the end of core period.

## Safety extension period

A total of 16 patients (64%) experienced at least one AE in the safety extension period (Table 67). A total of 53 AEs were reported in the safety extension period. Three patients (12%) each experienced SAEs and AEs of severe intensity. One patient (4%) experienced an AE considered related to Mircera by the investigator. One patient (4%) required blood transfusion. None of the patients experienced AEs leading  to  treatment  withdrawal  or  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification/interruption  during  the  safety extension period.

No major difference was noted in the pattern of AEs between the core and safety extension period.

The SOCs in which AEs were experienced by ≥ 15% patients were Infections and infestations (8 patients [32%]), and General disorders and administration site conditions (5 patients [20%]).

The most frequent AEs experienced by ≥ 5% patients were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, pyrexia, rhinitis, muscle spasms, hypotension, and headache (2 patients [8%] in each PT).

During the safety extension period, one patient experienced an AE of injection site pain (1 patient [4%]) considered to be related to Mircera by the investigator.

The pattern of AEs by intensity was similar between the core and safety extension period.

The AEs of WHO Grade 1-2 were experienced by 12 patients (48%) and WHO Grade 3-4 AEs were experienced by 3 patients (12%). One patient (4%) experienced a non-serious Grade 3 AE of pyrexia and  had  resolved.  Two  patients  (8%)  experienced  2  SAEs  of  Grade  4  hypotension  and  anaemia postoperative, both the SAEs had resolved.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

## Study NH19707

One patient  died  during  the  study  (in  the  core  study  period).  The  cause  of  death  was  reported  as intracranial hematoma. The patient had experienced head trauma as a result of a domestic accident.

## Study NH19708

No deaths were reported in the study.

## Serious adverse event

## Study NH19707

## Core period

Overall, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs during the core study period (4/16 [25%] in Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2).

Of  the  AEs  classified  as  serious,  two  were  considered  related  to  study  medication:  arteriovenous thrombosis and thrombosis in device.

## Safety extension period

Overall, 9/37 patients (24%) reported a total of 12 SAEs during the safety extension period (1/9 [11%] in Group 1 and 8/28 [29%] in Group 2). Of the AEs classified as serious, none were considered related to the study medication.

## Study NH19708

During the core period 13 patients (32.5%) experienced a total of 23 SAEs and 3 patients experienced a total of 4 SAEs in the safety extension period. All SAEs were considered unrelated to Mircera treatment by the investigator.

## Other significant events

## Hypertension

## Study NH19707

## Core period

Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as one of the risk factors  for  vascular  events  and  hemorrhage  and  37  (58%)  were  already  receiving  or  had  received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During the core study period, 8 patients (13%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment.

Of the 8 patients with arterial hypertension reported as an AE during the core study period, 7 had preexisting hypertension at enrolment or within 12 weeks prior to enrolment, and 1 had previously received antihypertensive therapy although this patient was not reported to have hypertension at enrolment or within 12 weeks of enrolment. In 1 patient, hypertension was reported as severe in intensity and as an SAE. The event resolved with treatment (doxazosin and carvedilol). One case of moderate hypertension was also reported as an SAE. Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure measurements were performed in all patients during the study.

Values remained close to baseline level, and no clear trend or difference between groups was apparent during the study.

## Safety extension period

During  the  safety  extension  period,  9  patients  (24%)  had  increased  antihypertensive  treatment compared with baseline (5 of these already had increased antihypertensive treatment in the core period).

There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with hypertension in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core period. In that patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in antihypertensive treatment was reported after the second event.

During the extension period, two patients reported hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event was associated with a change in antihypertensive medication.

## Study NH19708

At study entry, a total of 21 patients (52.5%) had hypertension.

During the core period, after initiating Mircera treatment, 2 patients reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of hypertension. One patient reported 2 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of hypertension and 1 patient reported 1 non serious, Grade 2 AE of hypertension. All 3 hypertension AEs were considered unrelated to Mircera treatment by the investigator and resolved with treatment.

No patients experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period.

Overall, in all patients, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP showed small variation across all visits compared to the median score at baseline during core and safety extension period.

## Vascular Access Thrombosis (VAS)

## Study NH19707

## Core Study Period

During the core study period, 4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5 events that may be classified as vascular access thrombosis. These events were defined as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 patients and 'thrombosis in device' in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 cases (one case of 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' and one case of 'thrombosis in device') were considered related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae.

## Safety Extension Period

During the safety extension period, 3 patients reported 5 events classified as vascular access thrombosis (different  patients  from  those  with  such  events  during  the  core  period).  These  were  coded  as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 cases and 'thrombosis in device' in 3 cases.

Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device' in 1 patient and 1 report of 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events ('arteriovenous fistula thrombosis') was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered related to study medication and all resolved without sequelae.

## Study NH19708

One patient experienced a total of 9 AEs of VAS. Of these 9 events, one was a serious Grade 2 AE and 8 were non-serious. All were considered unrelated to Mircera treatment by the investigator. From Day 128 to day 277, this patient had recurrent thrombosis in device. The patient changed dialysis modality from PD to HD on study day 127 due to PD catheter malfunction.

## Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia

## Study NH19707

No  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  or  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies  during  the  study.  No patients developed PRCA.

## Study NH19708

Two patients tested positive for anti-EPO antibodies. No effect on Hb or Mircera doses were seen and no AE of PRCA was reported.

## Laboratory findings and vital signs

## Study NH19707

## Hematology

In this study, Hb concentrations, reticulocytes, and red blood cell counts were considered part of the efficacy assessment. One patient had a moderate AE of Hb decreased due, according to the investigator, to the latency effect of Mircera. This AE resolved.

In clinical trials of Mircera in adults, slight decreases in platelet counts have been observed. In study NH19707, median platelet count at baseline was 221.5 x 109/L (range 182-398) and 208.0 x 109/L (range 80-518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period in both groups but remained within 16% and 20% of baseline, respectively. There was substantial within and between-patient variability of platelets in both groups. In Group 1, 1/16 patients had one or more postbaseline values below the site-specific normal range (typically 150-400 × 109/L). None had values

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

above normal range. In Group 2, 19/47 patients had one or more postbaseline values below normal range, of whom 6/19 already had low values at baseline, and 4/47 patients had one or more postbaseline values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline.

During the extension period, platelet values below the site-specific normal range were reported in 2 patients (29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2.

No events of bleeding were reported in any patients who had one or more post-baseline platelet counts below normal. Thrombocytopenia was reported as an AE in four patients; in all cases, the event was classified as mild and unrelated to study drug.

During the core study period, median haematocrit remained within 15% of baseline for both groups and remained stable during the safety extension period.

## Chemistry

Over the entire study period, median changes from baseline for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum albumin, calcium, blood glucose parameters, as well as for potassium and phosphate,  were  minor,  with  no  obvious  trends  over  time.  Abnormal  post-baseline  values  for  these parameters were observed only sporadically. The only abnormalities in these parameters reported as AEs were hyperkalemia (4 patients in total), hyperphosphatemia (3 patients in total) and hypocalcemia (1 patient in total). Two of these AEs were reported as severe (hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia).

Post  baseline  values  ≥  800  U/L  were  seen  at  some  timepoint  throughout  the  study  for  alkaline phosphatase in 4 and 3 patients in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. None of these abnormalities were associated with AEs.

## C-reactive protein

Median C-reactive protein (CRP) levels remained close to or below the baseline value throughout the study. The majority of patients had normal CRP levels at baseline and these values remained within normal range throughout the study. None of these patients experienced AEs.

## Iron parameters

In Group 2, the largest median changes from baseline were observed at Week 13 for iron (+6.75 μM/L from 12.00 μM/L at baseline), at Week 61 for ferritin (245.38 μg/L from 328.00 μg/L for ferritin) and Week 53 for transferrin saturation (13.11% from 26.82% at baseline). A similar pattern was observed in Group 1. In all cases, median values for these parameters remained within normal values. Two patients reported AEs related to iron parameters: iron deficiency and iron overload. Neither of these events was considered related to Mircera.

## Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety

During the core period, plots of pre-dialysis Z scores for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) showed no clear trend throughout the study, with median Z scores within ± 1 of the baseline. During the safety extension period, changes from baseline remained small in Group 2. Group 1 showed greater fluctuation, particularly after Week 57, although this may be a consequence of the low patient numbers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  both  dose  groups  approximately  60%  of  patients  had  at  least  three  consecutive  predialysis  and postdialysis SBP or DBP values at or above the age, sex, and weight specific 95th percentile. Median sitting pulse rate did not change by more than 10 bpm with respect to baseline at any time during the study.

## Changes in height and weight

Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth.

## Study NH19708

## Hematology

In this study, Hb concentrations, reticulocytes, and red blood cell counts were considered part of the efficacy assessment.

Mean Hb concentrations raised during the study period although Mircera dose was decreased. This should be further discussed (See efficacy MO/OC).

The red blood cell count was consistent as expected in patients with anemia due to CKD at baseline. The median RBC count showed a slight improvement over time during the core and safety extension period.

No clinically significant change was noted in the platelet count during the core period. Overall, a slight decrease in median platelet count was noted in all visits from the baseline value of 262.50 × 109 / L to 235 × 109/L at Week 21 and to 234 × 10 9/L at Week 45 but was within the normal range during the entire study period.

One patient showed a shift in platelet values from normal to low post baseline and 2 patients shifted from normal to high post baseline value. The patient with shift from normal to low post baseline value did not have any AE related to low platelet count.

## Chemistry

No major change in median values was noted for albumin (g/L), alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, and calcium over the course of the study. Although there were a few patients who had shifts from normal to low or high for these analytes, these were not clinically significant.

Serum electrolytes (phosphorus and potassium) showed a minor change in median values from baseline. A total of 14 patients (35%) and 10 patients (25%) shifted from normal to high during the study for phosphorous and potassium, respectively. However, these changes in serum electrolytes or phosphorous and potassium were not clinically significant.

## C-reactive protein

A decrease in median (min-max) C-reactive protein levels was noted across all visits from baseline value (2.40 mg/L [range: 0.0 - 145.0 mg/L]) to Week 21 (1.75 mg/L, [range: 0.0 - 84.0 mg/L]); however, there  was  no  major  change  noted  at  Week  45  (2.66  mg/L  [range:  0.0  -  16.2  mg/L])  compared  to baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of patients (25 patients [62.5%]) had normal CRP levels post baseline. Seven patients (17.5%) shifted from normal to high CRP levels. These changes in C-reactive protein levels were not clinically significant.

## Iron parameters

Overall, the iron parameters were increased but remained within the normal range throughout the study period.

The median baseline value for iron was 14.98 µ mol/L (range: 6.5-24.5 µ mol/L). The lowest and highest median change from baseline in iron was 2.82 µ mol/L (range: -14.2 - 26.4) and 5.08 µ mol/L (range: -12.1- 35) at Week 29, respectively.

The median baseline value for ferritin was 139.65 ng/mL (range: 18.9 - 939.5 ng/mL). The lowest and highest median change from baseline in ferritin was 13.66 ng/mL (range: -375.0 - 300.1) and 47.30 ng/mL (range: -379.0 - 673.2) at Week 37 and Week 21, respectively.

The median baseline value for transferrin saturation was 29.95% (range: 10.9%- 46.2%). The lowest and highest median change from baseline in transferrin saturation was 4.24% (range: -24.7 - 64%) and 9.64% (range: -20.8 - 139.8%) at Week 17 and Week 29, respectively.

## Dialysis Modality Over Time

Three  patients  (7.5%)  had  dialysis  modality  change  in  the  study.  All  three  patients  changed  to haemodialysis.

## Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety

At  baseline,  the  median  Z-score  was  0.99  for  SBP  and  0.71  for  DBP  in  patients  not  on  dialysis/on peritoneal  dialysis  (above  values  in  the  reference  population).  During  the  core  and  safety  extension period, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP showed small variation (within ±1 of baseline) across all visits compared to the median score at baseline; the greatest change was 0.37 at Week 5 for SBP and -0.33 at Week 17 for DBP.

In haemodialysis patients, the pre-dialysis baseline median Z-score was 1.16 for SBP, suggesting slightly higher pre-dialysis median SBP than the mean SBP in the reference population. The pre-dialysis baseline median Z-score was 0.28 for DBP. The post-dialysis baseline median Z-score was 0.78 for SBP and -0.18 at DBP.

In haemodialysis patients during the pre-dialysis assessments, the median Z-score for the SBP and DBP showed small variation (within ±1 of baseline) across all visits compared to the median score at baseline during the core period; during the safety extension period BP showed greater variation at the later visits compared  to  the  median  score  at  baseline.  The  MAH  justifies  these  large  variations  during  safety extension period due to low number of patients.

## Changes in height and weight

Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity

## Study NH19707

No patients tested positive for erythropoietin antibodies or anti-drug antibodies at any time during the study, including the safety extension period.

## Study NH19708

Blood samples were collected for anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing at Week 1, 9, 21 and 45. In all patients a total of 131 samples were tested for anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Overall, two samples tested positive  for  anti-Mircera  antibodies  and  four  samples  tested  positive  for  anti-EPO  antibodies  in  two patients.

In one patient, the Week 21 sample tested positive for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies with titers of 1:1.56 and 1:29.8, respectively. The earlier Week 9 sample from this patient tested negative for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. Since the baseline (Week 1) and end-of-study (Week 45) samples for this patient were unfit for analysis due to incorrect handling there was no way of knowing the  initial  or  final  status  of  this  patient.  The  patient  was  recalled  for  an  additional  ADA  sample approximately 7 months after the end of study visit. The patient had continued to be treated with Mircera off-label after participation in the study ended. The samples taken during patient recall tested negative for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies. During the period of study participation, Hb and Mircera doses were stable.

In the other patient, the Week 1 sample tested positive for anti-Mircera antibodies with a titer of 1:1.32. and anti-EPO antibodies with a titer of 1: 1.56. The patient tested positive for anti-Mircera at Week 1 although  he  had  never  been  treated  with  Mircera  before  study  enrolment.  The  same  patient  tested positive for anti-EPO antibodies at weeks 9 and 21 with titers of 1:3.20, and 1:8.77, respectively. AntiMircera antibodies tested negative at these time points. Subsequent samples taken at Week 45 tested negative for both anti-Mircera and anti-EPO antibodies.

In both of these patients, there was no evidence of PRCA and both continued to show response to Mircera treatment.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study NH19707

One patient died and did not complete study treatment during the core study period. No patients were withdrawn from study treatment due to a non-fatal AE in either study period.

No AEs led to dose modification at any time during the study.

## Study NH19708

None of the patients experienced any AE that led to withdrawal of the study treatment during the core or extension period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two patients (5%) experienced one non-serious AE each of Grade 2 anaemia during the core period. Both the AEs required Mircera dose to be increased. Both the AEs were considered to be unrelated to Mircera treatment by the investigator and had resolved.

## Supportive data

In addition to the safety data derived from clinical studies, the MAH has provided data from supportive paediatric registry study MH40258 (see supportive studies in clinical efficacy).

As reported by the MAH, the drug is well tolerated with long-term exposure. In adults, safety data from long-term exposure (BA16528 and BH21260) did not reveal any safety concerns and safety of Mircera was consistent with the known profile of Mircera.

The MAH also claims the long-term safety of the drug in paediatric patients is further supported by data from other ESAs. Schaefer et al .,  2016 has published the outcomes of long-term treatment (up to 2 years) in children with darbepoetin alfa. In that study, which included 319 patients aged from &lt; 1 years upwards (approximately half not yet on dialysis), no new safety signals were identified.

## Additional safety issues

Several pegylated products have been assessed by CHMP for marketing authorization. PEG accumulation has been discussed thoroughly by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) with a positive benefit/risk balance for adolescents and adults (age &gt;12 years). The major issue for this age restriction was the limited efficacy, which did not outweigh the (theoretical) risk of the vacuolisation.

Following the CHMP request, a discussion has been provided by the MAH regarding the biodistribution of the PEGylated drug product and the risk of vacuolation due to mPEG accumulation in choroid plexus and other tissues, and the risk for the paediatric population. In vivo distribution data indicated that Mircera can reach the brain, but at low levels, and it should be considered that PEG-induced cell vacuolation observed in toxicity studies performed with other PEGylated medicinal products were not associated to functional consequences. Furthermore, clinical experience with Mircera in adults and paediatric patients also did not raise any safety concerns pertaining to the PEG-induced vacuolation. As a consequence, no safety concern is expected related to PEG accumulation with Mircera (see non-clinical aspects).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

ESA therapy is an established treatment option to alleviate signs and symptoms associated with anaemia in  patients  with  CKD.  However,  ESA  therapy  has  been  associated  with  risks,  including  pure  red  cell aplasia,  stroke,  vascular  access  loss  and  hypertension.  In  clinical  trials,  an  increased  risk  of  death, serious  cardiovascular  events  including  thrombosis  or  cerebrovascular  events  including  stroke  was observed when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl.

The primary safety information in paediatric patients is derived from studies NH19707 and NH19708, that  included  patients  5-17  years  old  with  clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anaemia  on  haemodialysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment and patients 3 months-17 years paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dialysis, respectively. Patients included in both studies were receiving maintenance treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) prior to switching to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera).

During the whole study NH19707, the cumulative total exposure was 45.5 patient-exposure-year (PEY) with a mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera for at least 15 months. During study NH19708, a total of 40 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera. Overall, the patients received a median of 11 Mircera administrations (range: 1-11 administrations) during the core  and  safety  extension  periods.  Twenty-two  patients  [55%])  received  at  least  11  Mircera administrations.

Overall, the safety data set in the paediatric population is rather limited. It is acknowledged that this disease is uncommon in children and that the paediatric population tolerate better the anaemia and therefore are less likely to be treated with ESA. Also, limited data from patients &lt;1 year is available. Considering  the  nature  of  the  patients  with  symptomatic  anaemia  associated  with  CKD,  the physiologically normal low kidney function is not regarded as an issue, as ESA response is not influenced by  the  function  or  immaturity  of  the  kidneys,  but  it  is  by  the  severity  of  kidney  impairment.  Also, considering the shift to Mircera is occurring in patients in stable maintenance, monthly Hb monitoring and dose adjustments will allow to adapt doses to each patient. Although, considering long-half-life of Mircera, fragility of paediatric population, and limited low-doses available presentations, it is considered that ESA-treated patients &lt;1 year of age should only be switched if there is a compelling need for the switch. This has been reflected in the SmPC (section 4.4). Furthermore, lower doses than 30 µg cannot be administered with the prefilled pens. A warning has been included in the SmPC to reflect that subjects with  stabilized  Hb  and  with  an  expected  need  of  lower  doses  of  Mircera  than  30  µg  should  not  be switched.

Safety results from this phase II studies showed that 77% and 73% of patients in the core period and safety extension period reported at least one adverse event in study NH19707, and 80% and 64% of patients  in  the  core  period  and  safety  extension  period  in  study  NH19708  respectively.  These percentages seem lower than those obtained from pooled phase II/III trials conducted in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia where around 88% of patients reported at least one adverse event.

The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  &gt;15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and infestations,  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural complications, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, administration site conditions and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]).

The adverse events considered related to treatment in paediatric patients (study NH19707) were 7.8% in the core period and 5.4% in the extension period, and 5.0% and 4.0% for the same periods in study NH19708, respectively. For adult patients (pooled phase II/III trials) this data was around 6%.

One death occurred during study NH19707 due to intracranial hematoma related to head trauma in a domestic accident that was considered unrelated to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the evaluation period of study NH19707, 25% of patients (12/48) reported SAEs in Group, 2 were considered serious, and 2 were considered related to study medication: arteriovenous thrombosis and thrombosis in device. During the extension phase none were considered related to the study medication.

During NH19708 13 patients (32.5%) experienced 23 SAEs and three 4 SAEs in the safety extension period. None was considered related to Mircera treatment by the investigator.

Hypertension, vascular access thrombosis and anti-erythropoietin antibody-induced pure red cell aplasia (AEAB-PRCA) as potential safety concerns. These adverse events, along with decrease in platelet count and thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism), were considered of special interest during the clinical development of Mircera in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia and are described as adverse events in the product information.

During the evaluation period in study NH19707, 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse event, 7 of which showed hypertension prior to inclusion in the study. The other one had previously received  antihypertensive  therapy.  Two  of  these  cases  reported  (3.1%)  were  classified  as  serious adverse events, and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period of study NH19707 five patients (13.5%) reported hypertension, however two (5.4%) was classified as serious and not related to the study medication.

During the core period in study NH19708, 2 patients (5%) reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of hypertension,  that  were  considered  unrelated  Mircera  and  resolved  with  treatment.  No  patients experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period. One patient (2,5%) reported a total of 9 AEs of vascular access thrombosis in study NH19708; all of them were considered unrelated to treatment, and one was a serious grade 2 AE.

As with other ESA, blood pressure can increase during treatment and should be monitored while on ESA, and uncontrolled hypertension is a contraindication in the SmPC of Mircera. However, given the singlearm, open label nature of the studies it is difficult to conclude on the contribution of Mircera to these increases of blood pressure.

Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis in study NH19707 (2 patients (3.1%) described as thrombosis in device and 2 patients (3.1%) as arteriovenous fistula thrombosis). All cases were classified as serious adverse events but only two of them were considered related to the study medication (one case each). During the safety extension period of study NH19707 arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and thrombosis in device were reported in 2 patients each (5.4%). Two of them were classified as serious adverse event (one arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and the other one thrombosis in device) and none of them was considered related to the study drug.

No patients developed anti-drug antibodies or anti-erythropoietin antibodies during Study NH19707, neither pure red cell aplasia. Two patients tested positive for anti-EPO antibodies in study NH19708. No effect on Hb or Mircera doses were seen and no AE of PRCA was reported.

In study NH19708 mean Hb concentrations raised during the study period although Mircera dose was decreased. Mircera dose decreases were greater in younger patients. Following these safety concerns, the popPK model was updated (see Clinical efficacy section). Results for an additional analysis showed that the high variability PK and PD for Mircera lead to an overlap on PD outcomes between considering

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or not differences in bioavailability between ESAs, and, taking into account frequent monitoring is still required for these patients, the clinical impact could be considered not relevant.

In both studies platelet count decreased along evaluation the extension phase. This had been previously observed in adult treated patients. No bleeding events were reported in any patients who had postbaseline platelet counts below normal range.

In addition to the safety data derived from Study NH19707, the MAH has provided data from a paediatric registry study MH40258. No new safety concerns have been reported.

According to the data provided the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population seems similar to that of adults and no new AEs have been identified.

Nevertheless, clinicians should be warned that Hb level fluctuations may occur after conversion, and a warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  has  been  included  to  reflect  that  after  ESA  conversion,  a monthly/every 4-week Hb control is recommended (similar to the recommendation during ESA initiation therapy).

Given the information coming from non-clinical studies related to other PEGylated products, there is a possible risk of accumulation of PEG causing vacuolation in tissues such as brain, liver and kidney as seen in animals. The implication of this finding in humans is at the time being unclear. Following the CHMP request, the MAH has included a discussion of the potential concerns for use of Mircera, which is a  PEGylated  medicinal  product  in  paediatric  patients.  Results  provided  support  that  Mircera  is  not expected to cause any safety concern as consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation to the CNS and other tissues (see non-clinical assessment).

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

According to the data provided the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population appears to be similar to that of adults as no new safety adverse events have been identified. The safety database is quite limited, especially in the youngest children and especially in patients &lt;1 year. However, considering clinical experience of Mircera in adult patients, and the similar safety profile of Mircera in adults and children, no new safety concerns are raised at this moment.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.6. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to update the Instruction for Use in the Package Leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- No extensive changes have been made to the Package Leaflet to incorporate the paediatric indication, and no new descriptions related to contra-indications, warnings and precautions or undesirable effects have been added.

- Few precautions have been added to mitigate potential choking-risk for children (e.g.,

'immediately throw away the cotton ball or the gauze after use'). These are considered minor changes.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the previous ESA.

Anaemia is a common comorbidity in patients with CKD, including children. This condition is associated with multiple adverse clinical consequences and its management is a core component of nephrology care. Although numerous complex factors interact in the development of this anaemia, erythropoietin deficiency and iron dysregulation (including iron deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis) are the primary causes.

## 3.1.1. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Currently available treatment options for the management of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD include  short-acting  human recombinant erythropoietins and longer-acting erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). In Europe, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta and darbepoetin alfa are approved for the treatment of anaemia due to CKD in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and zeta are approved for patients  aged  1  to  18  years  on  haemodialysis  (HD),  and  epoetin  beta  is  approved  for  treating symptomatic  anaemia  caused  by  CKD  in  paediatric  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  yet  on  dialysis. Darbepoetin was approved by EMA for paediatric patients on and not yet on dialysis in 2015. Darbepoetin and epoetin beta are approved for IV as well as SC use in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa and epoetin zeta are approved for paediatric patients on HD, and dosing recommendations are given for IV use only.

Mircera  (methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-epoetin  beta)  is  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  currently approved for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adult patients. Mircera was first approved in Europe on 20 July 2007.

## 3.1.2. Main clinical studies

In this submission the MAH is seeking an extension of indication to include treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age on ESA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maintenance treatment. It is a switch indication from IV ESA to IV Mircera and from SC ESA to SC Mircera.

Efficacy  is  based  on  an  extrapolation  exercise,  two  dose  finding  studies  in  children  with  anaemia associated to CKD and a PopPK model. Overall, extrapolation is acceptable considering the availability of PK data in children compared to adults, the data in adults from adequate and controlled trials and that the physiopathology and the mechanism of action for efficacy is the same in adults and children.

Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population  (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on haemodialysis,  following  iv  administration  of  Mircera  after  switching  from  other  ESAs  (i.e.,  epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration and continued 4 weeks more during the evaluation period.

Study NH19708 was a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to ascertain the starting  dose  of  Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  3  months-17  years  paediatric  patients  with  CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dyalisis when switching with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or dabepoetin alfa. The core study was for 23 weeks and consisted of three periods: Screening (3 weeks), dose titration (16 weeks), and evaluation (4 weeks).

In both studies, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels and eligible patients were offered to enter a safety extension period.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

In study NH19707, the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was -0.09 g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) in group 2. During the evaluation period, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 81% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportion of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 69%. During the core phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL.

In study NH19708, the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 17-21) was the primary efficacy endpoint. The mean change (±SD) in Hb concentration level during the evaluation period for study NH19708 showed a 0.48 (1.03) g/dL increase above the baseline level. The 90% CI for the mean change in Hb concentration levels from baseline was within the protocol specified range of ±1.1 g/dL and the SD was &lt;1.5 g/dL.

During the evaluation period, 50% of patients maintained Hb values within the range of ± 1 g/dL of the baseline levels, and 63.2% within the range of 10-12 g/dL. The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and within 10-12 g/dL were 47.4%.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

In study NH19708 the Mircera mean dose was reduced approximately by 30% over the evaluation period, 62.5% of patients had dose decreases only and a considerable number of patients had an Hb value above the target range (30%). As mentioned in the Pharmacology Section, a 2.18-fold increase in SC bioavailability was estimated in paediatric patients compared to adult patients. In addition, the provided pcVPC for adult data following SC administration shows that the model excessively underpredicts the

median of the data, which indicates that the estimated bioavailability of 31% may be biased and the true SC bioavailability for adults is higher than this estimate. Safety concerns were raised following the SC switch, and the popPK model was updated.

Uncertainties of differences in paediatric SC bioavailability between other ESAs has been described, and these differences may have an impact on the apparently too high initial Mircera SC dose. Also, when the paediatric conversion doses are compared to the adult conversion doses, the paediatric conversion doses are considerably higher. For example, a 16-year-old subject on 60 µg darbepoetin would be switched to 360 µg Mircera whereas an 18-year-old with the same dose darbepoetin would be switched to 200 µg Mircera. Unfortunately, data provided by the MAH to address this question does not allow to conclude on the adequacy of the 'high conversion factor'. Considering that for practical and safety reasons the same  conversion  factor  for  IV  to  IV  and  SC  to  SC  switch  is  the  preferred  option,  and  the  already mentioned theorical safety concerns following SC to SC switch when the high CF is used, the intermediate CF is recommended to initiate the treatment with a lower dose, in order to avoid unnecessary high Hb levels, even when there is no clinical data supporting the use of that factor. This is taking on board that frequent monitoring is required for these patients, and patients can be uptitrated until reaching the appropriate  Hb  target.  This  would  also  avoid  the  discrepancies  between  paediatric  dosing  and  adult dosing.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

Safety results from these phase II studies showed that 77% and 73% of patients in the core period and safety extension period reported at least one adverse event in study NH19707, and 80% and 64% of patients in the core period and safety extension period in study NH19708 respectively.

The  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  (with  &gt;  15%  of  patients  overall  with  AEs)  were  Infections  and infestations,  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural complications, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, administration site conditions and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]).

During the core period of study NH19707, 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse event, 7 of which showed hypertension prior to inclusion in the study. The other one had previously received antihypertensive therapy. Two of these reported cases (3.1%) were classified as serious adverse events, and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period of study NH19707, five  patients  (13.5%) reported hypertension, however two (5.4%) was classified as serious and not related to the study medication. Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis in study NH19707 (2 patients  (3.1%)  described  as  thrombosis  in  device  and  2  patients  (3.1%)  as  arteriovenous  fistula thrombosis).  All  cases  were  classified  as  serious  adverse  events.  However  only  two  of  them  were considered related to the study medication (one case each). During the safety extension period of study NH19707 arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and thrombosis in device were reported in 2 patients each (5.4%). Two of them were classified as serious adverse event (one arteriovenous fistula thrombosis and the other one thrombosis in device) and none of them was considered related to the study drug. No thromboembolic events (i.e. pulmonary embolism) have been recorded in study NH19707.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the core period of study NH19708, 2 patients (5%) reported with 3 non-serious, Grade 2 AEs of hypertension,  that  were  considered  unrelated  Mircera  and  resolved  with  treatment.  No  patients experienced any AE of hypertension during the safety extension period. One patient (2,5%) reported a total of 9 AEs of vascular access thrombosis in study NH19708; all of them were considered unrelated to treatment, and ¡one was a serious grade 2 AE.

In both studies platelet count decreased along core and safety extension study period. This had been previously observed in adult treated patients. No bleeding events were reported in any patient who had post-baseline platelet counts below normal range.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Overall, the safety data set is very limited. This is an uncommon disease in children who are usually less symptomatic and in less need of treatment with ESA. The difficulties to obtain a broader data set is acknowledged but this translates into a limited characterisation of the safety profile. Also, limited data from patients &lt;1 year is available. Considering the nature of the patients with symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD, the physiologically normal low kidney function is not regarded as an issue, as ESA response is not influenced by the function or immaturity of the kidneys, rather than the severity of kidney impairment. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the long half-life of Mircera and that children &lt;1 year with renal failure or severe renal dysfunction is a frail population with high morbidity, it is considered prudent to carefully evaluate before switching from a well-functioning dosing of another product. This has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In addition, considering the shift to Mircera is occurring in patients in stable maintenance, monthly Hb monitoring and dose adjustments are recommended in the SmPC to allow to adapt doses to each patient.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The MAH has justified that the data available support the switch to Mircera of patients with anaemia associated with CKD who are clinically stable with epoetins or darbepoetin treatment, however data provided by the MAH to support the high conversion factor does not allow to conclude on its adequacy. It has been argued, that the high conversion factor with SC to SC switch administration results in Hb

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

values above the recommended level of 12 g/dL, especially in the youngest children (5/11 subjects). From this perspective, it has been considered more prudent to initiate treatment with a lower dose to avoid unnecessary high Hb levels and its potential associated safety issues. This also avoids discrepancies between paediatric dosing and adult dosing.

According to the data submitted it seems that no new safety adverse events have been described for Mircera in the paediatric population, although the safety database is considered limited, especially in children below 1 year old.

The risk of vacuolation due to PEG accumulation in choroid plexus and other tissues and the risk for the paediatric population has been previously described for other PEGylated products. Following the CHMP request, the MAH has included a discussion of the potential concerns for use of Mircera, which is a PEGylated medicinal product in paediatric patients. Results provided support that Mircera is not expected to cause any safety concern as consequence of PEG accumulation and its possible vacuolisation to the CNS and other tissues (see non-clinical assessment).

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The benefit risk balance of Mircera for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the previous ESA, is positive.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Mircera is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |

Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the previous ESA. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to update the Instruction for Use in the Package Leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB are recommended.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0317/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
