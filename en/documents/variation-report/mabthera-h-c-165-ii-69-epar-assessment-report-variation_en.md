## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1 Introduction

Follicular lymphoma is generally a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involving mature B lymphocytes, accounting for 11%-22% of all lymphoid malignancies and around 70% of indolent lymphomas. In Europe, there are around 74 800 new cases of NHL (all types) each year, including around 16 500 new cases of follicular lymphoma. The incidence of follicular lymphoma increases with age and it very rarely occurs in children . Most patients are over 50 years old, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years. Men and women are about equally affected. Most patients (&gt; 80%) with follicular lymphoma have widespread disease at diagnosis (Ann Arbor stage III/IV), including involvement of peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymph nodes and spleen.  The bone marrow is involved in 50%-60% of patients.  The disease is heterogeneous, and a number of prognostic factors have been identified, some of which are included in the widely used Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI).

Follicular lymphoma generally follows an indolent course, although the majority of patients die of lymphoma after a series of relapses and remissions of decreasing duration. Although follicular lymphoma is usually very responsive to initial chemotherapy, the disease typically becomes increasingly resistant to cytotoxic agents. Around 30% of follicular lymphomas may eventually transform to intermediate or high-grade lymphomas, which are clinically more aggressive and have a poor outcome. Patients are also at risk of developing therapy related secondary malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The risk increases with time and depends on the number, intensity, and type of previous cytotoxic treatments. Overall, the 2-year survival rate of patients with follicular lymphoma is about 90%. Median survival has improved in recent years from around 6-10 years at the end of the 1990s to &gt;10 years and as high as 18 years in one recent series.

Treatment options for patients with follicular lymphoma include ''watch and wait'', radiotherapy, and systemic treatments.  Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with stage I/II disease, and in a subset of these patients this may sometimes be curative. Since the natural course of the disease is heterogeneous and spontaneous regressions may occur, initiation of chemotherapy is only recommended for patients with   symptoms, haematopoietic impairment, bulky   disease, or rapid lymphoma progression.

Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (with interferon-alpha [IFN- ] or rituximab) have both been evaluated as maintenance therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma.  Rituximab is licensed in the EU as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding to induction with chemotherapy, with or without rituximab.

MabThera (rituximab) is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to CD20, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein which is present on the cell surface of pre-B- and mature Blymphocytes, but not on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. Importantly, CD20 is present on the malignant B-cells in most patients with mature B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.  Rituximab binds to CD20 on these cells and leads to their elimination via a number of different mechanisms, including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis.

Rituximab is administered by intravenous infusion.

Rituximab is currently approved in the EU for the following indications:

## Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma;

as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma responding to induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without rituximab;

for the treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy;

for the treatment of patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy.

## Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia

in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  Only limited data are available on efficacy and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including rituximab or patients refractory to previous rituximab plus chemotherapy (further information is provided in section 5.1 of the EU SmPC).

## Rheumatoid arthritis

in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of adult patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies.

This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications to include use of Mabthera as maintenance therapy in follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy.

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

## GCP

The MAH states that the PRIMA study was conducted in full conformance with the principles of the 'Declaration of Helsinki' and with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever afforded the greater protection to the patient. The study adhered fully to the principles outlined in the 'Guideline for Good Clinical Practice' ICH Tripartite Guideline (January 1997) or with the local law, if it afforded greater protection to the patient.

## Clinical efficacy

Main study PRIMA study

The PRIMA study was a randomised (1:1), multicentre/multinational, open-label, comparative, parallel group, two-arm study comparing rituximab maintenance with observation, in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma who responded to induction therapy with a rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy regimen [R-CHOP (rituximab- cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone,  R-CVP (rituximab-cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) or R-FCM (rituximabfludarabine, cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone)].

## METHODS

## Study Participants

To be eligible for the study, patients had to have histologically-confirmed grade 1, 2 or 3a follicular lymphoma according to National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria, and high tumour burden according to Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaire (GELF) criteria, indicating a need to initiate treatment. Patients with high grade (3b) or transformed lymphomas or with central nervous system (CNS) involvement were not eligible.

## Inclusion criteria, induction phase

- Histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma grade 1, 2, or 3a, with a lymph node biopsy performed within four months before study entry and with material available for central review.
- Patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (those on 'watch-and-wait' could enter the trial if a recent biopsy [obtained within the last four months] was available).
- Patients with at least one of the following high-tumour-burden GELF criteria requiring initiation of treatment:
- bulky disease defined as a nodal or extranodal (except spleen) mass &gt; 7 cm in its greater diameter
- B symptoms
- elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β 2-microglobulin
- involvement of at least three nodal sites (each with a diameter greater than 3 cm)
- symptomatic splenic enlargement
- compressive syndrome
- pleural/peritoneal effusion.
- Age must be 18 years or over.
- Performance status ≤ 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.
- Adequate haematological function (unless abnormalities are related to lymphoma infiltration of the bone marrow) within 28 days prior to registration, including haemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L), absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5×109/L, and platelet count ≥ 100×109/L.
- Women: no breast-feeding, using effective contraception, not pregnant, and agreed not to become pregnant during participation in the trial and for 12 months thereafter. Men: agreed not to father a child during participation in the trial and for 12 months hereafter.
- Signed informed consent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Inclusion criteria, maintenance/observation phase

To enter the maintenance/observation phase, patients had to meet the following criteria:

- Patients must have achieved a partial response (PR) or complete response/unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at the end of induction treatment.
- All indicator lesions reported on the on-study form must have been re-evaluated.

## Exclusion criteria, induction phase

Patients that met any of the following criteria were excluded from study entry:

- Transformation to high-grade lymphoma (secondary to 'low-grade' follicular lymphoma).
- Grade 3b follicular lymphoma.
- Presence or history of CNS disease (either CNS lymphoma or lymphomatous meningitis).
- Patients regularly taking corticosteroids during the four weeks prior to study entry, unless administered at a dose equivalent to ≤ 20 mg/day prednisone over that time.
- Patients with prior or concomitant malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer or adequately treated in situ cervical cancer.
- Major surgery (excluding lymph node biopsy) within 28 days prior to registration.
- Poor renal function: serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (197 μ mol/L).
- Poor hepatic function: total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 μ mol/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3
- × Upper Limit Normal (ULN), unless these abnormalities were related to lymphoma.
- Known HIV infection or active hepatitis B or C infection within 28 days prior to registration. Testing for hepatitis B was not mandatory but recommended for all patients considered at high risk of infection and in endemic areas. Patients with any serological evidence of current or past hepatitis B exposure were excluded unless the findings were clearly due to vaccination.
- Serious underlying medical conditions that could impair the patient's ability to participate in the trial (eg, ongoing infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune disease).
- Life expectancy of less than six months.
- Known sensitivity or allergy to murine products.
- Treatment within a clinical trial within 30 days prior to study entry.
- Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition that would preclude the patient's participation in the study or compromise their ability to give informed consent.
- Adult patients under tutelage (not competent to sign the informed consent form).

## Exclusion criteria, maintenance/observation phase

Patients were excluded from the maintenance/observation phase of the study if they met any of the following criteria:

- Patients who had serious underlying medical conditions that could impair their ability to participate in the trial (eg, ongoing infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune disease).
-  Patients  who  could  not  complete  all  cycles  of  induction  treatment  due  to  toxicity  or  had  not completed at least four cycles of R-CHOP + 2R, six cycles of R-CVP, or four cycles of R-FCM induction treatment.
-  Patients  who  had  a  delay  in  treatment  of  more  than  14  days  following  any  cycle  of  induction chemotherapy.

## Treatments

The study had two treatment phases:

## Induction phase:

During the (non-randomised) induction phase, patients with advanced follicular lymphoma were evaluated for response to one of three possible induction regimens, R-CHOP, R-CVP, or R-FCM. Most patients (75%) received R-CHOP induction therapy. As the three induction regimens differed in the number of immunochemotherapy cycles usually administered for patients with follicular lymphoma (8 cycles of R-CVP, 6 cycles of R-CHOP, and 6 cycles of R-FCM), two additional infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2) were added to the standard R-CHOP and R-FCM regimens for the PRIMA study. As a result, each patient in the induction phase would receive the same number of rituximab infusions (eight) prior to randomisation in the maintenance/observation phase, and the scheduled treatment phase would be 24 weeks for all three regimens.

## Maintenance/observation phase:

Patients who responded to induction treatment with a CR/CRu or PR were randomised to receive either rituximab maintenance therapy (one dose of 375 mg/m 2  every eight weeks for two years, i.e., a total of 12 doses) or observation (no further treatment, one visit every 8 weeks, a total of 12 visits).  All randomised patients were to be treated/observed for two years and then followed up for five years. The trial design is shown in Figure 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1. Trial design

<!-- image -->

R: rituximab; CVP: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, amd prednisone; CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxonubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; FCM: fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone. SD: stable disease; PD: progressive disease; PR: partial response; CR(u): complete response (umconfirmed).

## Objectives

The primary objective of the PRIMA study was to evaluate the benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab on progression-free survival (PFS) compared to no maintenance therapy (observation) after induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in patients with high tumour-burden follicular lymphoma.

The secondary objectives were as follows:

To evaluate event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNLT), time to next chemotherapy treatment (TTNCT), response rates at the end of maintenance treatment, transformation rate at first relapse, and quality of life (QoL) for three different chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab, with or without maintenance rituximab, for first line treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma.

To assess safety of rituximab maintenance therapy over 2 years as measured by the incidence of toxicity.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomisation to first documented disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause as evaluated by the investigator and by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).

Secondary endpoints were EFS (the time from randomisation to first documented progression, relapse, initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment or death from any cause), OS (the time from randomisation to death, regardless of cause), TTNLT [time from randomisation to first documented administration of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radio immunotherapy, immunotherapy)], TTNCT (time from randomisation to first documented administration of new chemotherapy or new cytotoxic agent), response rates at the end of maintenance treatment, transformation rate at first relapse, QoL and overall safety.

## Sample size

The primary endpoint of PFS was used to determine the final sample size of the study. To demonstrate a 45% increase in median PFS from the time of randomisation (six months after the start of induction therapy), for  example, from 37.2 months to 54 months, 900 patients were required to be randomised in the maintenance/observation period. With an estimated response rate to induction immunochemotherapy of 75%, 1200 patients would need to be recruited in the induction period to ensure that 900 patients entered the maintenance/observation phase.

The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions:

- Overall alpha = 5%
- Power = 80%
- 1:1 randomisation between the treatment arms
- A monthly hazard rate of 0.0186 in the observation group corresponding to a median PFS of 37.2 months

CHMP variation assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A monthly hazard rate of 0.0186 within the first six months after randomisation (to mimic a possible lag in treatment effect) and 0.0121 thereafter for the maintenance arm (corresponding to a median PFS of 54 months)
- 900 patients would be randomised within 24 months (23 patients per month within the first 16 months, and 53 patients thereafter)
- One interim analysis would be performed after 75% of the total number of required PFS events. The alpha-spending function using the O'Brien-Fleming boundary was applied to maintain the overall twosided Type I error of 0.05.

## Randomisation

Patients who achieved a CR/CRu or PR after induction treatment and also fulfilled all other eligibility criteria were randomised in the maintenance/observation phase of the study. A stratified block randomisation procedure (block size: four) was used. Randomisation was stratified by induction regimen (R-CHOP, R-CVP, R-FCM), by response (CR/CRu, PR), by region GELA sites, Europe non-GELA, South America, Asia, Australia/New Zealand), and by centre (in countries other than France and Belgium, the country was considered as a single centre). Patients were allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to receive rituximab maintenance or no treatment (observation).

## Blinding

The pivotal study was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Four analysis populations were defined:

-  Induction analysis population (IAP): all patients who received at least one component of the planned induction treatment regimen (R-CVP, R-CHOP, R-FCM).
- Maintenance intent-to-treat population (MITT): all randomised patients regardless of whether they received study treatment or not were included in this analysis population according to the maintenance therapy that they were randomised to receive.
- Maintenance per protocol population (PPP): all randomised patients who received at least six courses of maintenance treatment or completed at least six observation visits or who terminated treatment/observation because of progression or death and adhered to the protocol.
- Maintenance safety population (MSAP): all patients who received at least one dose of maintenance trial treatment/attended at least one observation visit and had at least one safety follow-up, whether withdrawn prematurely or not.

The statistical analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints are summarised in table 1:

- a Eleven of the 15 patients were randomized in the maintenance/observation phase (five to the observation arm, six to the rituximab arm) before the centers were closed.
- b Defined as patients not withdrawn before completion of induction treatment and evaluated after completing induction treatment.

Of the 1202 patients registered, 1193 received a first course of induction treatment and are included in the induction analysis population (IAP). Nine patients withdrew from the study after registration but prior to receiving treatment and were excluded from the IAP. Of the 1193 patients treated, 1114

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients completed all eight cycles of induction treatment (ie, 6 R-CHOP + 2R, 8 R-CVP, or 6 R-FCM + 2R), with each additional rituximab injection for the R-CHOP and R-FCM regimens considered as a cycle. The proportion of patients completing eight cycles was over 95% in the R-CHOP group, about 90% in the R-CVP group, and 75% in the R-FCM group.

- C Completed is defined as patients not withdrawn before completion of maintenance treatment/ observation and evaluated at end of treatment/observation.
- d Includes one patient ongoing observation/two patients ongoing treatment entering follow-up.

A total of 1019 patients at 208 centres were randomised in the maintenance/observation phase of the PRIMA study: 506 patients were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance therapy, and 513 patients were randomised to the observation arm. The first patient was randomised on 5 July 2005, and the last patient was randomised on 22 November 2007.

## Recruitment

A total of 1217 patients were enrolled in the PRIMA trial over a period of 29 months: the first patient was registered on 24 December 2004 and the last patient was registered on 11 April 2007. Three participating sites in Mexico were closed prematurely because of compliance issues and it was agreed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) that data for the 15 patients registered at those sites should be excluded from the main statistical analyses.

A total of 1202 patients were enrolled in the PRIMA trial from 220 centres in 24 countries, excluding the Mexican sites. France was the major recruiting country, enrolling over 50% of patients in the study.

## Conduct of the study

Five amendments were made to the PRIMA study protocol. Key features of these amendments are described below:

- Amendment 1 (Protocol Version 3.1), dated 24 August 2005: This amendment applied to patients enrolled at French study sites only. It scheduled monitoring of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) as well as levels of circulating B-cells (CD19-positive), T-cells (CD3-positive), and natural killer cells (CD16- or CD56-positive) every six months for three years after randomisation or until recovery to baseline if not reached by this time. Measurement of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies was also scheduled at baseline, at the end of the induction phase, and at the end of the maintenance/observation phase.
- Amendment 2 (Protocol Version 3.2), dated 14 February 2006: This amendment increased the target enrolment from 640 patients (with 480 to be randomised in the maintenance/observation phase) to 900 patients (with 675 to be randomised in the maintenance/observation phase) to allow for more informative subgroup analyses within each induction immunochemotherapy group.
- Amendment 3 (Protocol Version 4.0), dated 16 August 2006: This amendment modified the primary endpoint of the study from EFS to PFS and increased the total number of study patients from 900 to 1200. The number of PFS events required for the final analysis was also modified, partly to account for a possible six-month lag inrituximab treatment benefit following randomisation. In line with these changes, the number of PFS events that would trigger interim efficacy analyses was also increased (from 100 and 150 events for the first and second interim analyses, respectively, to 172 and 258 events). The amendment also removed rituximab plus mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisone as a potential induction immunochemotherapy regimen (no patients had been treated with this induction regimen at the time), stipulated the minimum induction treatment required for randomisation, increased the duration of follow-up after completion of the maintenance/observation phase from three to five years, and introduced an independent, blinded review of lymphoma response and progression.
- Amendment 4 (Protocol Version 5.0), dated 22 February 2008: This amendment removed the first preplanned analysis which was scheduled to take place after 50% of events. This change was made following a recommendation by the DSMC who pointed out that at the expected time of the first interim analysis there would be limited follow-up of patients and a large proportion of patients would still be on active treatment. Therefore, regardless of the results of that first interim analysis, a recommendation to stop the study early would be highly unlikely since the results would be considered immature and would require confirmation with longer follow-up. Accordingly, the protocol was amended to include only one interim analysis after 75% of events occurred. The guidelines for completing and reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) were clarified to make it explicit that SAEs on both maintenance and observation arms were reportable. Prior to this amendment, SAE reporting in the observation arm was not clearly specified in the protocol. However, investigators and monitors were instructed to treat both arms equally with respect to the reporting of SAEs and the case report form gave the same instructions for both arms. The oversight in the protocol wording was corrected as part of this amendment.
- Amendment 5 (Protocol Version 5.1), dated 4 December 2008: (administrative change only).

## Numbers analysed

The primary population for the efficacy analyses was the MITT population comprising all patients who completed the randomisation process. The MITT population comprised 1018 patients: 513 patients in the observation arm and 505 patients in the rituximab arm. Based on all patients randomised, 5 patients in each arm were excluded from the MSAP as they did not receive study drug or did not attend an observation visit, respectively, after randomisation.

A total of 844 patients were included in the PPP. A higher proportion of patients in the observation arm (103 patients, 20%) than in the rituximab arm (72 patients, 14%) were excluded from the PPP. The main reason for this difference was inadequate maintenance treatment/observation visits (47 patients in the observation arm vs 11 patients in the rituximab arm).

* p-values and hazard ratios were calculated using the stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox regression for timeto-event endpoints, respectively. Stratification factors were induction treatment received and response to induction treatment.  p-values  for  response  rate  were  calculated  using  the  2  test,  and  odds  ratios  were  calculated  by  using logistic regression (response rate analyses were unadjusted).

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS)

At the time of the analysis (clinical cut-off date 14 January 2009), the median duration of follow-up was 25 months. At the time of the analysis, 174/513 patients in the observation arm and 93/505 patients in the rituximab arm (33.9% vs 18.4%) had experienced a progression event (i.e., disease progression/relapse or death) since randomisation (Table 6). Maintenance therapy with rituximab in patients responding to induction therapy reduced the risk of experiencing a progression event by 50% compared with no further treatment (stratified HR 0.50, 95% CI [0.39;0.64], p &lt; 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS times could not be calculated for either arm, however, the 25th percentile times were calculated as 507 days (16.7 months) for patients on observation and 1096 days (36 months) for patients on rituximab maintenance (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test).

## Supportive study ECOG 1496 trial

The ECOG 1496 study was a phase III, randomised, controlled, multicentre, intergroup study of the efficacy and safety of rituximab as post-induction therapy compared with observation.

## METHODS

To be eligible for the study, patients had to have International Working Formulation (IWF) Grades A through C lymphoma (i.e., patients with marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytoid and small lymphocytic lymphoma were eligible, as well as patients with follicular lymphoma).

The main criteria for inclusion were previously untreated patients ≥ 18 years of age with Stage III or IV low-grade (IWF Grades A through C), CD20, B-cell lymphomas. An ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was required.

The original protocol was designed to compare cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (CF) and CVP as induction regimens, but as a result of increased early mortality in the CF induction arm, the study was amended so that all further patients received CVP induction (cyclophosphamide 1 g/m 2  on day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2  on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m 2  on days 1-5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients who achieved a CR, PR, or SD following induction therapy (Stage 1) were randomised to rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m 2  weekly for 4 weeks, repeated at 6-month intervals for a total of four cycles [16 doses total]) or observation.

A total of 401 patients received CVP induction therapy (119 randomised to the CVP arm, and 282 assigned to CVP following the protocol amendment), of whom 322 showed a response or stable disease and were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance (n=162) or observation (n=160) in Stage 2 of the study.  The maintenance randomisation was stratified by extent of residual disease post-induction (minimal or gross) and histology (follicular or other). A total of 305 patients (157 in the rituximab arm and 148 in the observation arm) were assessable for efficacy.  Of these, 248 patients were considered to have follicular lymphoma, including 125 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 123 in the observation arm.

The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of PFS, defined as the time from maintenance randomisation (Stage 2) to the first occurrence of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of OS (from maintenance randomisation) and response improvement within 2 years of maintenance randomisation.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 401 patients received CVP induction therapy (119 randomised to the CVP arm, and 282 assigned to CVP following the protocol amendment).  The overall response rate to induction therapy was 73% (13% CR; 60% PR) and 19% had SD; data based on induction population N=387 taken from Hochster et al, 2009 (Hochster H. et al (2009), JCO 27:1607-1614). In total, 322 of 401 patients showed a response or SD and were randomised to receive rituximab maintenance (n=162) or observation (n=160).  These patients comprised the primary analysis population (PAP).  Two hundred and forty eight (248) patients were considered to have follicular lymphoma, including 125 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 123 in the observation arm.

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS)

At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004)  based  on  a  median  follow  up  of  27  months,  133 patients had experienced a PFS event, 46 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 87 in the observation arm. Based on the stratified analysis, the hazard ratio of progression, relapse, or death for patients in the  rituximab  maintenance  arm  relative  to  those  in  the  observation  arm  was  0.36  (95%  CI:  0.25, 0.52).

In the subset of patients with follicular lymphoma, in the observation arm, 68/123 patients (55.3%) were considered to have a progression event compared to 34/125 patients (27.2%) in the rituximab. The  hazard  ratio  of  progression,  relapse,  or  death  for  patients  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm relative to those in the observation arm was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.56) (Table 12).

## Overall Survival

A total of 36 deaths were reported, 15 in the rituximab maintenance arm and 21 in the observation arm  (Table  13).  The  median  duration  of  overall  survival  was  not  estimable  for  patients  in  the observation arm, and the estimate for the rituximab maintenance arm (approximately 69 months) was based on a single death when only two patients were at risk.

## Updated analysis

An updated efficacy analysis has been performed for the ECOG 1496 study, based on a median followup of 67 months for the observation arm and 71 months for the rituximab maintenance arm. As of the clinical cut-off date of 31 May, 2008, a total of 282 patients had been followed for over 3 years (136 in the  observation  arm  and  146  in  the  rituximab  maintenance  arm).    Of  these,  212 patients  had experienced  a  PFS  event  (124 patients  in  the  observation  arm  and  88  patients  in  the  rituximab maintenance  arm).    Median  PFS  was  15  months  in  the  observation  arm  versus  55  months  in the rituximab  maintenance  arm.    After  this  extended  follow-up  period,  maintenance  therapy  with rituximab reduced the risk of progression by 56% compared with no further treatment (HR 0.436, 95% CI  [0.330, 0.576]).  For  the  subset  of  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma  after  3  years  follow-up  the results were as follows: median PFS 4.3 years in the rituximab maintenance arm compared with 1.3 years for observation patients (HR 0.4, 95% CI [0.3, 0.6]).

At  the  clinical  cut-off  for  the  final  analysis  of  the  ECOG 1496  study,  46  patients  (29%)  in  the observation arm and 37 patients (23%) in the rituximab maintenance arm had died.  The median OS time had not been reached and no statistically significant difference in OS was observed. The hazard ratio for OS for the maintenance rituximab arm relative to the observation arm was 0.773 (95% CI [0.501, 1.193], p = 0.19). The 3-year OS for the subset of patients with follicular lymphoma was 91% for rituximab maintenance versus 86%   for observation (HR 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2; p = 0.08).

## Response Improvements during the rituximab maintenance/observation phase

Of  the  263 patients  who  had  SD  or  PR  as  their  best  response  to  induction,  129 patients  were randomised to the observation arm and 134 patients were randomised to the rituximab maintenance arm.    The  percentage  of  patients  with  SD  or  PR  after  induction  whose  response  improved  within 2 years  following  randomisation  to  rituximab  maintenance  or  observation  was  20.9%  and  7.0%, respectively.    The  difference  between  the  arms  of  13.9%  was  statistically  significant  (95%  CI: [5.6%, 22.6%]; p  0.001) (Table 14).

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

After a median follow up-time of 25 months the results from the pivotal study showed that the 25 th percentile PFS for patients on observation was 16.7 months and for patients on rituximab maintenance it was 36 months, with a Hazard Ratio of 0.5 (CI 0.39; 0.64).

The increase of PFS was seen in the total group as well as in the sub-group of patients treated with induction R-CHOP. In the sub-groups treated with induction R-CVP or R-FCM a trend for PFS increase was observed, however the difference was not statistically significant. This could possibly be explained by  the  low  percentage  of  patients  receiving  these  induction  therapies  and  experiencing  an  event, resulting in wide CI.

There is no head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of R-CVP vs. R-CHOP in patients with follicular can achieve excellent overall responses, by which the response rates for R-CHOP were slightly higher.

lymphoma . In a meta-analysis concerning this issue, it was concluded that both R-CHOP and R-CVP The PFS of follicular lymphoma patients who were treated with R-CHOP as induction therapy, proved to be significantly increased after rituximab maintenance in comparison to observation (no maintenance). There is  no  rationale  to  assume  a  different  effect  of  rituximab  maintenance  treatment  after  various induction regimes (R-CVP or R-CHOP).

The  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints,  EFS,  Time  to  next  anti-lymphoma  treatment,  time  to  next chemotherapy treatment, response rate at end of maintenance/observation phase, were consistent and in  line  with  the  increase  in  PFS  and  suggest  a  benefit  for  rituximab  maintenance  treatment  at  first remission.

However the improvement of PFS didn't translate into a significant increase in OS, (HR of 0.89 with a CI 0.42; 1.74). The lack of a significant improvement of OS could be explained by the low number of deaths recorded (18 deaths in the observation arm and 16 deaths in the rituximab maintenance arm) at the time of analysis (after a median follow up time of 25 months), resulting in a wide CI. Another explanation could be that the results are diluted by the efficacy of any next line (possibly rituximabcontaining) therapy at progression.

After updated analysis, based on a later clinical cut-off (June 30, 2009), no statistical significant OS benefit could be determined either, as too few additional events had occurred.

Patients will be followed until 5 years after completion of the 2-year maintenance/observation period for  PFS  and  OS.  The  OS  data  to  be  obtained  after  completion  of  the  follow-up  period  must  be considered  important  to  assess  the  safety  of  rituximab  maintenance  after  first  remission  induction. Results must be submitted as a FUM.

The  result  from  the  supportive  study  concerning  the  increase  in  PFS  in  response  to  rituximab maintenance is in agreement with the results obtained in the pivotal study. Concerning PFS benefit, a HR  of  0.37  in  favour  of  rituximab  maintenance  therapy  was  reported.      In  the  supportive  study, rituximab maintenance seems to be even more beneficial, however the effect can be exaggerated by the fact that none of the patients were treated with rituximab during the induction phase and therefore the patients in the observational arm never had the benefit of any rituximab treatment during this trial. Like  in  the  pivotal  study,  the  OS  is  not  significantly  increased  after  rituximab  maintenance  at  first remission when compared with OS in the observation arm.

Nevertheless,  the  percentage  of  patients  (including  patients  with  follicular  lymphoma  or  other lymphoma) who improved from SD/PR to PR/CR two years after randomisation was significantly higher in the rituximab maintenance arm vs. observation (20.9% vs. 7.0%). In the setting of the supportive study, this observation further attests to the clinical benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy.

## Clinical safety

PRIMA study

##  Patient exposure

## Induction Phase

Of the 1018 patients who entered the randomised maintenance/observation phase of the study, all but three  had  completed  their  induction  therapy  according  to  the  protocol.    One  patient  in  each  of  the rituximab maintenance and observation arms completed only 6 of the eight rituximab/chemotherapy induction cycles, while an additional patient in the rituximab maintenance arm received 7 out of the eight induction treatment cycles. Nine of the 1018 patients withdrew before the start of observation or maintenance  treatment,  and  finally  the  rituximab  maintenance/observation  phase  safety  analysis population (MSAP) comprised 1009 patients (508 observation, 501 rituximab).

## Maintenance/observation phase

At the clinical cut-off of January 14 2009, 285 patients (57%) in the rituximab arm had received all 12 treatment cycles and completed the 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy (Table 16).  In comparison, 95 patients (19%) in the observation arm had completed all 12 observation visits.  The median number of visits attended for patients in the observation arm was 9, compared to 12 visits attended (cycles received) in the rituximab arm.

##  Adverse Events

The proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event (including Grade 3-5 toxicities, Grade 2-5 infections, and SAEs) during the maintenance/observation phase was 52% in the rituximab arm  vs  35%  in  the  observation  arm.  The  most  common  categories  of  AEs  were  infections  and infestations  (mainly  bronchitis),  neoplasms  (mainly  basal  cell  carcinoma),  and  blood  and  lymphatic system disorders (mainly neutropenia). The incidence of other categories of AEs was &lt; 4% and similar in  the  two  study  arms.  AEs  which  occurred  with  an  incidence  of  1%  or  more  in  either  arm  are presented in Table 18.

Percentages are based on N.

Multiple occurrences of the same adverse event in one individual counted only once. AE13 19JAN2010:14:15:35

*AEs with an incidence of less than 1% in both arms are also displayed in this table due to rounding-up of crude rates ≥ 0.995% to 1%.

The majority of AEs were Grade 2 in severity (165/269 [61%] in the observation arm; 291/459 [63%] in the rituximab arm ) , and the majority (85%) of those events were Grade 2 infections (144 events in the observation arm, and 248 events in the rituximab arm).

More patients in the rituximab arm than in the observation arm experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (23% vs 16%). This difference was mainly due to a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs &lt;1%) and infections (4% vs &lt;1%) in the rituximab arm than in the observation arm, respectively.

There were five Grade 5 (fatal) AEs.

##  Other serious adverse events (SAEs)

A total of 193 SAEs were reported for 158 patients (63 [12%] in the observation arm, and 95 [19%] in the  rituximab  arm)  during  the  maintenance/observation  phase  (Table  19).  No  single  type  of  SAE occurred with an incidence of 1% or more in either arm. The most common class of SAEs overall was neoplasms (39 events overall affecting 37 patients), including basal cell carcinoma (2 patients in the observation arm vs 4 patients in the rituximab arm), colon cancer (three patients in the rituximab arm) and breast cancer (two patients in the rituximab arm). The most common class of SAE in the rituximab arm was infections and infestations (25 patients [5%] vs 6 patients [1%] in the observation arm). In the rituximab arm, 3 patients had SAEs of pneumonia, 2 patients had diverticulitis, and two patients had hepatitis B. In the observation arm, 3 patients had SAEs of urinary tract infections. Other serious infections  were  reported  by  1  patient  in  each  case.  Serious  cardiac  disorders  were  reported  for  2 patients in the observation arm compared with 11 patients in the rituximab arm.

##  Deaths

At the time of data cut-off (January 14, 2009), a total of 31 patients in the safety population (MSAP) had died (Table 20).  The number of deaths was higher in the observation arm than in the rituximab arm  (18  patients  vs  13  patients).  The  most  common  cause  of  death  was  disease  progression (lymphoma), which accounted for 12 deaths in the observation arm and 10 deaths in the rituximab arm. The incidence of non-lymphoma deaths was: 6 patients in the observation arm vs 3 patients in the rituximab arm.

Five of the 9 remaining deaths were considered to be outcome of AEs (Table 21). Two fatal AEs in the observation  arm  were  a  result  of  neoplasms:  leukaemia  considered  as  possibly  related  to  trial treatment and metastatic neoplasm considered to be treatment-unrelated. The 3 recorded fatal AEs in the  rituximab  arm  resulted  from  a  treatment-unrelated  disorder  (unknown/unevaluable  event), hepatitis B considered to be probably treatment-related and pulmonary haemorrhage considered to be treatment-unrelated.

The remaining 4 deaths (not due to lymphoma or reported as AEs) were all in the observation arm and were due to acute myeloid leukaemia, coronary artery disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, and sepsis.

##  Laboratory findings

## Haematology and Biochemistry

Haematology and biochemistry parameters were very similar between the two arms during the course of the maintenance/observation phase, except for lymphocyte counts, which increased with time in the observation arm compared with the rituximab arm. This difference was probably due to B-cell recovery in the observation arm compared with continued B-cell suppression in the rituximab arm.

The majority of patients in both study arms showed no change in NCI-CTC grade for any laboratory test parameter during the maintenance/observation phase. In the rituximab arm, a higher number of shifts to Grade 3/4 values was observed for lymphopenia as well as leucopenia and neutropenia. There were very few shifts to Grade 3/4 for blood chemistry parameters, and for these parameters there was little difference between the two study arms.

In  the  rituximab  arm,  8%  of  patients  recorded  newly  occurring  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  based  on laboratory  counts,  while  4%  of  patients  recorded  AEs  of  neutropenia.  Similarly,  10%  of  patients recorded newly occurring Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia based on laboratory data, while less than 1% of patients recorded adverse events of lymphopenia.

## Additional Laboratory Parameters

## Differential Lymphocyte Counts

Patients at study sites in France underwent additional sampling for immunophenotyping of peripheral blood cells. Absolute levels of circulating  B-cells  (CD19-positive),  T-cells  (CD3-positive),  and  natural killer cells (CD16- or CD56-positive) were assessed before induction therapy, after induction therapy (baseline), and every six months for the first three years after randomisation or until recovery if not reached at this time.

## B-Cells

Analysis  of  CD19-positive  lymphocyte  subsets  showed  suppression  of  B-cells  in  both  study  arms  at baseline (after completion  of induction therapy) and  continued  B-cell  suppression  during the maintenance/observation  phase  for  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm.  In  comparison,  patients  in  the observation arm showed recovery of B-cells during the maintenance/observation phase, with the mean value  returning  to  within  the  normal  range  by  visit  6  (ie,  approximately  one  year  after  completing induction therapy). The mean B-cell count in the observation arm at the end of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maintenance/observation phase was  0.16 × 10 9 /L (compared  with undetectable counts in the rituximab arm.

## T-Cells

The mean T-cell counts at baseline (after  completion  of induction  therapy)  was  0.90 × 10 9 /L  in  the observation  arm  vs  0.91 × 10 9 /L  in  the  rituximab  arm  (both  within  the  standard  reference  range). Although  the  mean  values  increased  to  1.06 × 10 9 /L  in  the  observation  arm  and  decreased  to 0.86 × 10 9 /L in the rituximab arm at visit 3), there was little difference between the two arms over subsequent visits and most patients in the two arms remained within the normal range throughout the maintenance/observation phase.

## Natural Killer Cells

The mean counts of natural killer (NK) cells at baseline (after completion of induction therapy) were 0.17 × 10 9 /L  in  the  observation  arm  vs  0.17 × 10 9 /L  in  the  rituximab  arm.  These  values  increased slightly  during  the  course  of  the  maintenance/observation  phase,  and  remained  within  the  normal range throughout the maintenance/observation phase. At visit 12, the mean counts were 0.24 × 10 9 /L in the observation arm and 0.23 × 10 9 /L in the rituximab arm.

## Immunoglobulins

Over the course of the maintenance/observation phase, mean Ig (IgG, IgA and IgM) values and 95% confidence intervals in both study arms remained within the normal range.

Although the numbers of patients with available IgG data decreased during the maintenance/observation phase, the majority of evaluable patients in both arms continued to have IgG levels of 4 g/L or higher. At the end of the maintenance/observation phase, 11 patients (26%) in the observation arm and 36 patients (47%) in the rituximab arm had IgG levels lower than 7 g/L. One patient (2%) in the observation arm and 4 patients (5%) in the rituximab arm had IgG levels lower than 4 g/L at the end of the maintenance/observation phase.

Recovery  of  IgG  levels  during  the  maintenance/observation  phase  was  observed  for  5  of  the  11 patients who had IgG levels at the end of induction lower than the LLN and lower than the value at screening (1/5 patients [20%] in the observation arm, and 4/6 patients [67%] in the rituximab arm). Of  7  patients  with  IgA  concentrations  below  LLN  and  their  screening  value  after  induction,  none showed recovery. During the maintenance period, 9/11 patients showed recovery of IgM concentrations in the observation arm vs 2 /16 patients in the rituximab arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Infections  were  the  most  commonly  occurring  AEs  in  all  three  age  categories.  For  patients  under 65 years,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  54%  in  the  rituximab  arm  vs  32%  the  observation  arm.  For patients aged 65-74 years, the overall incidence of AEs was 47% in the rituximab arm vs 46% in the observation arm. In the  75 year age group, the incidence of AEs was 52% in the rituximab arm vs 50% in the observation arm.

## Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

Nine pregnancies were reported in the PRIMA trial, including 2 pregnancies in the female partners of male  patients.  Two  pregnancies  occurred  during  the  induction  phase,  and  7  pregnancies  occurred during  the  maintenance/observation  phase.  Of  the  6  patients  who  became  pregnant  during  the maintenance/observation phase, 3 patients were in the observation arm and 3 patients were in the rituximab  arm.  The  3  women  in  the  observation  arm  received  4,  6,  and  7  doses  of  rituximab, respectively, and all delivered normal babies, 1 baby delivered at 35 th gestational week, the 2 others probably both at full term.

-  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No new information is available

-  Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation

A total of 27 patients discontinued maintenance treatment/observation as a result of AEs (8 patients [2%] in the observation arm, and 19 patients [4%] in the rituximab arm). The most common AEs that led to treatment discontinuation were neoplasms, which accounted for the withdrawal of 6 patients in the  observation  arm  and  5  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm.  Four  patients  in  the  rituximab  arm  were withdrawn as a result of infections: hepatitis B (2 patients), endocarditis, and mycobacterial infection. One case of hepatitis B was considered to be unrelated to trial treatment, and the other 3 infections were  considered  as  being  probably  treatment-related.  Five  patients  discontinued  treatment  after becoming pregnant.

## Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruptions or Modifications

A total of 30 patients had their dosing of rituximab interrupted or modified as a result of an AE. The most common reasons for interrupting the dose schedule or for modifying the rituximab dose were infections  and  infestations  (12  patients)  including  three  bronchitis  events  and  two  upper  respiratory tract infections, and blood and lymphatic disorders (9 patients) including seven neutropenia events and five leucopenia events.

-  Post marketing experience

## Since the first marketing authorisation of rituximab, more than 2.1 million patients have been treated with this antibody. The majority of these were patients with NHL.

With  a  data  cut-off  date  of  31  December  2009,  a  total  of  44,681  AEs  have  been  reported  with rituximab worldwide to the global safety database. Of these reported AEs, 21,642 were classified as serious.  The  events  were  reported  from  spontaneous  sources  (post-marketing  experience).  Other sources include clinical trials in oncology and rheumatoid arthritis (company-sponsored and investigator-sponsored trials). A summary of all AEs in the global safety database for rituximab as of 31  December  2009  is  shown  in  the  table  23.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  were  from  the system organ classes (SOCs) general disorders and administration site conditions (15.9%), infections and infestations (14%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (10.4%) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (9.5%).

## ECOG 1496 trial

##  Patient Exposure

Patients in the ECOG 1496 study were to receive a minimum of 6 cycles and a maximum of 8 cycles of CVP induction therapy. Of the patients that proceeded to the rituximab maintenance/observation phase of the study, a total of 96% (309/322) received between 6 and 8 cycles of induction CVP (157/161 patients  [97.5%]  were  subsequently  treated  with  rituximab  maintenance  and  152/161  patients [94.4%] who then underwent observation).

At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004),  52%  (83/161)  of  patients  treated  with  rituximab maintenance  had  received  the  protocol-specified  maximum  of  16  infusions,  and  42  patients  (26%) were still in the study and continuing to receive rituximab maintenance.

##  Adverse events

At  the  time  of  data  transfer  (November  8,  2004),  144  patients  (89%)  who  received  rituximab maintenance had experienced one or more AEs during the rituximab maintenance/observation phase of the study compared with 101 patients (63%) in the observation arm.  The most common AEs, affecting between 30-45% of rituximab-treated patients, were haematological (leucopenia, anaemia), fatigue, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Other common events in the rituximab arm included infections and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nervous system disorder (each 19%), lung disorder (18%) and liver and skin disorder (each 17%), all of which had a higher frequency with rituximab than with observation.

All  AEs  for  which  there  was  at  least  a  2%  higher  frequency  among  patients  in  the  rituximab maintenance arm  compared  with those in the observation arm beginning from the time of randomisation to the rituximab maintenance/observation phase are summarized in Table 25.

At  the  cut-off  date,  21  patients  (13.1%)  in  the  observation  arm  and  15  patients  (9.3%)  in  the rituximab arm had died during the study.  Of these, 10 patients in the observation arm and 8 patients in the rituximab arm were considered to have died due to progressive disease.  There was one AE that resulted in death: one patient in the observation arm died due to an infection.  The cause of death was recorded as 'not treatment- or disease-related' for 7 patients in the observation arm and 3 patients in the rituximab arm and as 'missing/unknown for 4 patients in each arm.

A  total  of  5  expedited  AEs,  all  cardiac  in  nature,  were  recorded  in  2  patients  during  Stage  2 (maintenance  phase)  of the study. One  patient treated with rituximab  maintenance  therapy experienced  extrasystoles,  ventricular  arrhythmia  and  ventricular  tachycardia  (all  Grade  4),  while  1 patient in the observation arm experienced myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia (both Grade 4).

In reply to CHMP concerns the MAH submitted a summary of all adverse events presented in Table 27.

##  Discussion on clinical safety

Based on the results from the pivotal study, the most common AE in the rituximab arm during the maintenance/observational  phase,  was  infection  and  infestations  (especially  bronchitis  and  upper respiratory tract infection), which was reported for 37% of patients in the rituximab arms vs. 22 % of patients in the observation arm. Also AE belonging to the blood and lymphatic system class were more frequently observed in the rituximab maintenance arm. The difference was mainly caused by higher number of neutropenia cases (14 in the rituximab arm vs. 5 in the observation arm).

Overall, the most common class of SAE was neoplasm, occurring in both trial arms (17 patients in the observation arm and 20 in the rituximab arm).

The most common class of SAE in the rituximab arm was infections and infestations (25 patients in the rituximab arm vs. 6 patients in the observational arm).

The  number  of  deaths  was  higher  in  the  observation  arm  than  in  the  rituximab  arm  (18  vs.  13 patients). Also the incidence of non-lymphoma deaths was higher in the observation arm than in the rituximab arm.

The  results  from  the  supportive  study  concerning  the  reported  AEs  and  the  difference  between maintenance rituximab and observation were comparable with the AEs reported in the pivotal study. More  AEs  in  the  blood  and  lymphatic  system  and  infections  were  observed  in  the  rituximab maintenance arm in comparison with the observational arm.

The potential risk of PML and the risk of second malignancies require additional risk minimization activities and the proposed monitoring is adequate. As a consequence, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include information on the PML risk. Finally, since PML

occurs predominantly in patients that are immunosuppressed, section 4.3 of the SmPC has been updated to include contraindication for patients in a severely immunocompromised state.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to postmarketing cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and Reversible Posterior  Leukoencephalopathy  Syndrome  (RPLS),  the  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  risk factors for PRES/RPLS.

Overall,  rituximab  maintenance  therapy  was  well  tolerated  and  no  unexpected  safety  findings  were observed.

| Infections (including serious infections)   | Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities   | Routine: The labelling for the RA indication cautions prescribers regarding the use of rituximab in patients with an active infection or other predispositions to serious infection, and regarding the prompt evaluation and treatment of infections that occur following rituximab therapy. Company representatives will be informed as part of their training to draw prescribers' attention to this information. Additional: In ongoing and planned clinical trials, prospective monitoring of laboratory markers of humoral immune status (eg, B cell counts, Ig counts/titres, complete blood counts) is performed. The clinical trials allow placebo comparisons of humoral immunity markers during the double blind period, as well as long term follow up for patients who continue with rituximab in open label extensions. In ongoing and planned clinical trials, prospective data collection and focused evaluation of all infections/symptoms of infection is conducted. Spontaneous reports of hepatitis B infection will be assessed using a standardized questionnaire to determine if the infection is de novo or a reactivation of a previous infection. All reports of Hepatitis B or reactivation of Hepatitis B are expedited for reporting to the agency, with regular data reviews. All reports of tuberculosis or reactivation of tuberculosis will be carefully analysed and reported to the agency. As part of its rituximab-specific protocol, the BSRBR, ARTIS and RABBIT will collect data regarding the incidence of serious infections and the administration of IV immunoglobulins.   |

| Acute Infusion-Related Reactions            | Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities   | Routine: The decision for all patients to receive IV corticosteroid pre-medication was based on the reduced incidence and severity of acute infusion reactions in patients in study WA17043, who were pre-treated with IV corticosteroid. In study WA17043, medically-reviewed acute infusion reactions following the first infusion of the first course occurred in 18/65 (28%) patients who received rituximab (1 g dose) without IV corticosteroid pre-medication compared to 24/127 (19%) patients who received rituximab with IV corticosteroid premedication. The addition of oral corticosteroid between rituximab infusions did not appear to provide any additional benefit over use of IV corticosteroid alone for the prevention of acute infusion reactions. Therefore the sponsor considers the use of IV corticosteroid as pre-medication to be advisable prior to all rituximab infusions. This advice is reflected in the SmPC. Additional: Spontaneous reports of possible infusion reactions will be assessed and evaluated using good pharmacovigilance practices. In ongoing and planned clinical trials, prospective data collection and evaluation of serious/severe infusion reactions will continue to be carried out in long term follow-up for patients in open-label extensions. As part of the proposed rituximab-specific protocols, the British Society of Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR), the Swedish registry (ARTIS) and the German registry (RABBIT) will report serious infusion reactions.                                                                               |

## 4 Benefit risk assessment

## Benefits Beneficial effects

The  data  presented  from  the  pivotal  PRIMA  trial  and  the  supporting  ECOG  1496  trial  showed  that rituximab maintenance therapy every two months for two years gives a significant improvement of PFS in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who have responded to standard induction chemotherapies. PFS has been recognized by the CHMP as a relevant primary endpoint in this clinical situation, and as such, an improvement in PFS may be of clinical relevance.

The results of the PRIMA study showed that the 25 th  percentile PFS for patients on observation was

16.7  months  and  for  patient  on  rituximab  maintenance  was  36  months,  with  a  HR  0.50  [(CI  0.39; 0.64), investigator based] or 0.54 (IRC-based). However, it is difficult to evaluate the absolute PFS gain with nearly 75% of the patients still classified as responders at the end of the maintenance phase. The median has not been reached in the investigator-assessed dataset. For the IRC-assessed dataset the median PFS gain is 6.2 months (from 30.9 to 37.1 months). In the context of a very long natural history (median OS about 10 years) of the targeted disease, the long-term benefit of this gain is still uncertain.

Furthermore,  there  is  no  difference  in  OS  for  the  two  treatment  strategies  (observation  vs. maintenance).

On the positive side, rituximab maintenance significantly delays time to next anti-lymphoma therapy by  a  year  (a  secondary  endpoint)  and  may  decrease  the  transformation  rate  (non  statistically significant result). More patients are classified as responders (CR/CRu/PR) at the end of maintenance therapy (74% versus 55%).

The  results  of  the  supportive  ECOG1496  were  comparable  to  the  results  of  the  PRIMA  study:  a statistically  significant  increase  of  the  PFS  was  observed  (HR  of  0.37  with  a  CI  of  0.25;  0.56)  after rituximab  maintenance  therapy  in  comparison  with  observation  only.  The  PFS  improvement  in  this study seems to be even better than in the PRIMA study. However the benefit might be overestimated as the patients included in the observational arm didn't receive rituximab at any moment of the trial.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

A  median  follow-up  of  about  2  years  is  relatively  short  for  the  assessment  of  long-term  benefit  of rituximab maintenance although the cut-off date allows a final analysis of the primary endpoint PFS. Taking into account that all patients will have a continuous pattern of relapse and retreatments, it is not  realistic  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  rituximab  maintenance  on  OS.  However,  patients  must  be followed up for PFS and OS for at least five years, final OS data should be submitted in time (FUM).

There  certainly  are  data  to  support  that  a  long  remission  after  first-line  therapy  predicts  a  better response to subsequent therapies and a longer survival. However, as maintenance therapy after firstline treatment has yet to show an OS benefit, the biology may be different in patients who relapse on the background of rituximab maintenance therapy than in patients who have only been observed. The rituximab resistance rate after rituximab maintenance therapy at first remission has not been studied. More data about the rituximab resistance rate as the result of post-first line maintenance therapy are needed to estimate this effect on the success (response, PFS, OS) of eventual rituximab retreatment.

Both  the  pivotal  study  and  the  supportive  study  showed  a  clear  trend  towards  a  lower  HR  for  PFS events in younger patients (0.45 in patients &lt; 60 yrs. vs. 0.59 in patients &gt; 60 yrs in the PRIMA trial). One might suspect that the benefit is further diluted in even older patients, e.g. patients &gt; 70 year, who make up a considerable fraction of follicular lymphoma patients (25-30 %), according to a Dutch population-based  registry  study  (Maartense  et  al.  (2002),  Ann  Oncol  13(8):  1275-1284.)  and approximately 20% in the ECOG 1496 study. Further subgroup analyses of the PRIMA trial (for which the trial is not powered) indicate that patients older than 70 or 75 years may have lesser benefit from rituximab maintenance therapy (HRs between 0.80 and 1.15, with very wide confidence intervals).  A further subgroup analysis of the elderly patients is needed when more mature data become available, with more events making the subgroup statistics more meaningful.

The PRIMA study included only patients with a high-tumour burden according to the GELF criteria and it  is  not  entirely clear whether the data can be extrapolated to all patients with follicular lymphoma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, the supportive ECOG study included patients with stage III-IV according to the Ann Arbor staging system making the claimed indication reasonable.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Safety  data  from  the  pivotal  PRIMA  trial  are  in  line  with  the  SmPC  and  previous  post-marketing experience for this monoclonal antibody that has been marketed in the EU since 1998. The important difference in safety is a clear increase in the incidence of infections and leuko-/neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab as maintenance. There is an increased incidence of SAEs related to infections, cardiac disorders and gastrointestinal disorders in the rituximab arm. The numbers are still rather low (maybe even if compared to an age-matched background population).

There  is  a  clearly  increased  incidence  of  infectious  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  rituximab  arm.  While  the difference is clear regarding SAEs, the numbers are quite low (25 infectious SAEs in the rituximab arm and 6 SAEs in the observation arm).

The data do not raise concerns about a high risk of HBV reactivation during rituximab maintenance therapy.  As  in  other  studies,  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  observed  sporadic  occurrence  of  PML  is secondary to rituximab or to previous chemotherapy/compromised immune  system function. Unconfounded cases of PML have been reported in patients with RA treated with rituximab.

Furthermore, significant laboratory value differences between the rituximab and the observation arms are  the  suppressed  level  of  B-cells  and  the  (usually  within  normal  ranges)  reduced  immunoglobulin counts in the rituximab arm.

It is reassuring that the numbers of deaths are lower in the rituximab maintenance arm with regards to both lymphoma-related and non-lymphoma-related deaths.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Relatively few elderly patients (&gt;75 yrs) were included in the pivotal study. AEs and SAEs do not seem to increase with age. However, the elderly patients selected for a randomised trial do not necessarily reflect  an  age-matched  background  population  for  which  we  are  concerned  when  considering  the risk/benefit balance.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

It  is  a  dogma in cancer therapy that achievement of durable remission is of clinical benefit because eradication of all neoplastic cells is a prerequisite for long-term cure. A lesser reduction in the tumour burden  for  a  period  of  time  may  also  be  of  clinical  benefit.  Therefore,  PFS  represents  an  accepted intermediate efficacy endpoint. PFS should generally be supported by a prolongation in OS. However, considering the very long natural history for patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma with a median survival of about 10 years, PFS remains the only realistic efficacy endpoint. In evaluating the importance of a clear PFS gain as shown in this application, one has to take into account the natural course of disease of patients with follicular lymphoma. The disease usually follows an indolent course with a continuous pattern of relapses after each therapy, the remissions having decreasing duration with increasing number of retreatments. In younger and middle-aged patients the cause of death is most  commonly  the  lymphoma  or  the  therapy  related  with  secondary  malignancies.  At  the  time  of death many patients will have had transformation to a more malignant aggressive lymphoma.

On that clinical background a PFS gain in a rather narrow time window cannot stand alone as measure of  clinical  benefit.  Significant  PFS  gain  has  been  adequately  demonstrated  by  the  pivotal  and supportive  study.  The  primary  endpoint  is  supported  by  a  higher  response  rate  at  the  end  of maintenance therapy (75%) compared to a rate  of 55% in patients also reflected  in  a  delay  of  12 months in time to next therapy. Since such therapy most probably will comprise cytostatics, this delay is considered to be of clinical benefit. There are also data to support that a long remission after firstline therapy predicts a better response to subsequent therapies and a longer survival. However, these data  are  mainly  derived  from  clinical  series  without  maintenance  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  the findings can be extrapolated to the population in question. A high response rate will most probably also mean  less  constitutional  symptoms  but  this  effect  has  not  been  specifically  addressed  in  this application.  Finally,  there  are  no  indications  that  rituximab  maintenance  enhances  the  risk  of histological transformation. Although insignificant so far, the incidence of transformation may be lower in patients receiving maintenance therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  the  negative  side,  the  burden  of  additional  maintenance  therapy  in  terms  of  toxicity  should  be taken in account. The known safety profile of rituximab remains unchanged when the antibody is used as maintenance every two months for two years. The mortality is numerically lower in the maintenance group both in relation to lymphoma deaths and non lymphoma deaths.

Therefore, no serious unfavourable effects have been detected.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

The application has demonstrated a very clear gain in PFS supported by a higher remission rate at the end of maintenance, a delay in the time to next antilymphoma therapy and a potential lower rate of histological transformation.

No serious safety concerns have been identified.

Therefore, the CHMP considered that the Benefit-Risk ratio of rituximab for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients responding to induction therapy is positive.

All the proposed consequential changes to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SmPC and to the Package Leaflet were agreed.

Further,  the  MAH  has  updated  annex  IIB  to  reflect  the  latest  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan (version  5.1)  agreed  with  the  CHMP,  which  is  acceptable.  Minor  editorial  changes  have  also  been implemented.
