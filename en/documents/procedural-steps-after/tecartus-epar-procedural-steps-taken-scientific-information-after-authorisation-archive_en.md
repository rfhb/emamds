| II/0019 | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the safety and efficacy information based on 24-month follow-up data from all treated patients in cohort 1 of the pivotal clinical study, KTE-C19-102 (ZUMA-2); a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of KTE-X19 in subjects with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This submission is in fulfilment of the specific obligation (SOB 004) to confirm the long- term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) MCL. As a consequence Annex II E has been updated with deletion of the fulfilled SOB. In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC. The RMP version 2.1 has also been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 23/06/2022 | 02/09/2022 | SmPC and Annex II | The updated 24-month follow-up analyses of efficacy were conducted using the modified intent to treat (mITT) analysis set, which consisted of 68 patients treated with Tecartus. In the 24-month follow up analysis, the ORR and CR rates in the 68 patients in the mITT analysis set were 91% and 68% respectively.
