## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

ALISADE 27.5 micrograms/spray nasal spray suspension

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each spray actuation delivers 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Nasal spray, suspension.

Medicinal product no longer authorised White suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Adults, adolescents (12 years and over) and children (6 - 11 years) Alisade is indicated for the treatment of: · the symptoms of allergic rhinitis 4.2 Posology and method of administration Fluticasone furoate nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only. For full therapeutic benefit regular, scheduled usage is recommended. Onset of action has been observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration. However, it may take several days of treatment to achieve maximum benefit, and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will improve with continuous regular use (see section 5.1). The duration of treatment should be restricted to the period that corresponds to allergenic exposure. Adults and Adolescents (12 years and over)

<!-- image -->

The recommended starting dose is two spray actuations (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms).

Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril (total daily dose 55 micrograms) may be effective for maintenance.

The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.

## Children (6 to 11 years of age)

The recommended starting dose is one spray actuation (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms).

Patients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms). Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) is recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children under 6 years of age: The experience in children under the age of 6 years is limited (see section 5.1 and 5.2). Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established.

Elderly Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2).

Renal Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2).

Hepatic Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2).

The intranasal device should be shaken before use. The device is primed by pressing the mist release button for at least six spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright. Repriming (approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 days or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. The device should be cleaned after each use and the cap replaced.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Medicinal product no longer authorised Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Alisade. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, therefore the systemic exposure of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease is likely to be increased. This may result in a higher frequency of systemic adverse events (see section 4.2 and 5.2). Caution is advised when treating these patients. Ritonavir Concomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5). Systemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects vary between patients and different corticosteroids (see section 5.2). Treatment with higher than recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically significant adrenal suppression. If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, then additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery.  Fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or paediatric subjects. However the dose of intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the symptoms of rhinitis is maintained. As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently.

Growth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed doses. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric specialist (see section 5.1).

If there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring patients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate.

Nasal and inhaled corticosteriods may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history if increased pressure, glaucoma and/or cataracts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Alisade contains benzalkonium chloride. It may cause irritation of the nasal mucosa.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4.

Based on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), that is metabolised by CYP3A4, co-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate.

Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with measurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) compared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a statistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups (see section 4.4).

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed as fluticasone furoate is not expected to affect this ability.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating metabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses. Therefore, no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation There are no adequate data from the use of fluticasone furoate in pregnant women. In animal studies glucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth retardation. This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure (see section 5.2). Fluticasone furoate should be used in pregnancy only if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the foetus or child. It is unknown whether nasal administered fluticasone furoate is excreted in human breast milk. Administration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Data from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions. The following convention has been used for the classification of frequencies: Very common &gt;1/10; Common &gt;1/100 to &lt;1/10; Uncommon &gt;1/1000 to &lt;1/100; Rare &gt;1/10,000 to &lt;1/1000; Very rare &lt;1/10,000.

| Immune system disorders                         | Immune system disorders                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rare                                            | Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. |
| Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders | Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders                                    |
| Very common                                     | *Epistaxis                                                                         |
| Common                                          | Nasal ulceration                                                                   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Epistaxis was generally mild to moderate in intensity. In adults and adolescents, the incidence of epistaxis was higher in longer-term use (more than 6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks).  In paediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between patients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo.

Systemic effects of nasal corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for prolonged periods.

## 4.9 Overdose

In a bioavailability study, intranasal doses of up to 2640 micrograms per day were administered over three days with no adverse systemic effects observed (see section 5.2). Acute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids. ATC code: R01AD12

<!-- image -->

Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action.

## Clinical experience:

## Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents

Compared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and ocular symptoms (comprising itching/burning, tearing/watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 studies. Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hours dosing period with once daily administration.

Onset of therapeutic benefit was observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration, with further improvement observed for several days afterwards.

Fluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients' perception of overall response to therapy, and the patients' disease-related quality of life (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire - RQLQ), in all 4 studies.

## Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents:

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as well as patients' perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in three studies. Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as well as improving patients' disease-related quality of life (RQLQ) compared to placebo in one study. Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing period with once daily administration.

## Seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children:

The paediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis population in children.

In seasonal allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective but no significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily and placebo on any endpoint.

In perennial allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a more consistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 weeks' treatment. Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study, as well as 6-week HPA axis safety study, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily on adrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24hour serum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo.

Results from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily revealed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate in children (6 to 11 years).

## Seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children (under 6 years):

Safety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate. Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Absorption: Fluticasone furoate undergoes incomplete absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and gut resulting in negligible systemic exposure. The intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily does not typically result in measurable plasma concentrations (&lt;10 pg/ml). The absolute bioavailability for intranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50 %, such that less than 1 microgram of fluticasone furoate would be systemically available after administration of 110 micrograms (see section 4.9).

In the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable (&lt; 10 pg/ml) following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily. Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric patients following 55 micrograms once daily.  There was no evidence for higher quantifiable levels of fluticasone furoate in younger children (less than 6 years of age). Median fluticasone furoate concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg/ml and 18.9 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. At 110 micrograms, median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg/ml and 14.4 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. The values are similar to those seen in adults (12+) where median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg/ml and 21.8 pg/ml at 55 micrograms and 110 micrograms, respectively.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Distribution: The plasma protein binding of fluticasone furoate is greater than 99 %. Fluticasone furoate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of, on average, 608 l. Metabolism: Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/h) from systemic circulation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17 β -carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the Sfluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17 β -carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have revealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone. Elimination: Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous administration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following intravenous administration, the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1 % and 2 % of the orally and intravenously administered dose, respectively. Children:

## Elderly:

Only a small number of elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years, n=23/872; 2.6 %) provided pharmacokinetic data. There was no evidence for a higher incidence of patients with quantifiable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the elderly, when compared with the younger patients.

## Renal Impairment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing. Less than 1 % of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate.

## Hepatic Impairment:

There are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment. A study of a single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-∞ ) (172 %) and a modest (on average 23 %) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. From this study the average predicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore moderate hepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The exposure of fluticasone furoate is likely to be further increased in such patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Medicinal product no longer authorised Findings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and are associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. These findings are not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure. No genotoxic effects of fluticasone furoate have been observed in conventional genotoxicity tests. Further, there were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of tumours in two year inhalation studies in rats and mice. 6.

## 1. WHAT ALISADE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR

<!-- image -->

Alisade nasal spray is used to treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis including stuffy, runny or itchy nose, sneezing and watery, itchy or red eyes, in adults and children aged 6 years and over.

Allergy symptoms can occur at specific times of the year and be caused by allergy to pollen from grass or trees (hayfever), or they can occur all year round and be caused by allergy to animals, house-dust mites or moulds.

Alisade belongs to a group of medicines called glucocorticoids . Alisade works to decrease inflammation caused by allergy ( rhinitis ).

## 2. BEFORE YOU USE ALISADE

## Do not use Alisade:

If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients of Alisade.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Take special care with Alisade:

If you have any liver problems, tell your doctor or pharmacist. Your doctor may adjust your dose of Alisade.

Taking nasal glucocorticoids (such as Alisade):

- may when taken for a long time cause children to grow more slowly. The doctor will check your child's height regularly, and make sure he or she is taking the lowest possible effective dose.
- may cause eye conditions such as glaucoma (increase in pressure in the eye) or cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye).  Tell your doctor if you had these conditions in the past, or if you notice any change in your vision while you are taking Alisade

## Taking other medicines

Tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including those bought without a prescription.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken any of the following medicines:

- steroid tablets or injected steroids
- steroid creams
- medicines for asthma
- ritonavir, used to treat HIV
- ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections

Your doctor will assess whether you should take Alisade with these medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine.

Do not use Alisade if you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.

Do not use Alisade if you are breast feeding unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.

## Driving and using machines

Alisade is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Alisade

<!-- image -->

Alisade contains benzalkonium chloride. In some patients this can cause irritation in the inside of the nose. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you feel discomfort when using the spray.

## 3. HOW TO USE ALISADE

Always use Alisade exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.

Alisade has virtually no taste or smell. It is sprayed into the nose as a fine mist. Be careful not to get any spray into your eyes. If you do, rinse your eyes with water.

## When to use Alisade

- Use once a day
- Use at the same time each day.

This will treat your symptoms throughout the day and night.

## How long Alisade takes to work

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Some people will not feel the full effects until several days after first using Alisade. However, it is usually effective within 8 to 24 hours of use.

## How much to use

## Adults and children 12 years and over

- The usual starting dose is 2 sprays in each nostril once every day.
- Once symptoms are controlled you may be able to decrease your dose to 1 spray in each nostril, once every day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children 6 to 11 years

- The usual starting dose is 1 spray in each nostril once a day.
- If symptoms are very bad your doctor may increase the dose to 2 sprays in each nostril once every day until the symptoms are under control. It may then be possible for the dose to be reduced to 1 spray in each nostril once every day.
- Do not use in children under 6 years old.

## How to use the nasal spray

There is a step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray after Section 6 of this leaflet. Follow the guide carefully to get full benefit from using Alisade

Ô See Step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray , after Section 6.

## If you use more Alisade than you should

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

If you forget to use Alisade If you miss a dose, take it when you remember.

If it is nearly the time for your next dose, wait until then. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this product, or if you have any discomfort using the nasal spray ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Like all medicines, Alisade can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Allergic reactions: get a doctor's help straight away

Allergic reactions to Alisade are rare and affect less than 1 person in 1,000. In a small number of people, allergic reactions can develop into a more serious, even life-threatening problem if not treated. Symptoms include:

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO USING THE NASAL SPRAY

## What the nasal spray looks like

The nasal spray comes in a brown glass bottle inside a plastic casing - see picture a . It will contain either 30, 60 or 120 sprays, depending on the pack size that has been prescribed for you.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The window in the plastic casing lets you see how much Alisade is left in the bottle. You will be able to see the liquid level for a new 30 or 60 spray bottle, but not in a new 120 spray bottle because the liquid level is above the window.

## Six important things you need to know about using the nasal spray

- Alisade comes in a brown bottle. If you need to check how much is left hold the nasal spray upright against a bright light . You will then be able to see the level through the window.
- When you first use the nasal spray you will need to shake it vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds. This is important as Alisade is a thick suspension that becomes liquid when you shake it well - see picture b . It will only spray when it becomes liquid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The mist-release button must be pressed firmly all the way in, to release the mist through the nozzle - see picture c .
- If you have difficulty pressing the button with your thumb, you can use two hands - see picture d
- Always keep the cap on the nasal spray when you are not using it. The cap keeps the dust out, seals in the pressure and stops the nozzle from blocking up. When the cap is in place the mistrelease button cannot be pressed accidentally.
- Never use a pin or anything sharp to clear the nozzle. It will damage the nasal spray.

## Preparing the nasal spray for use

## You must prepare the nasal spray:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Preparing the nasal spray helps to make sure you always get the full dose of medicine. Follow these steps:

- 1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds.
- 2 Remove the cap by squeezing firmly on the sides of the cap with your thumb and forefingersee picture e .
- 3 Hold the nasal spray upright, then tilt and point the nozzle away from you.
- 4 Press the button firmly all the way in. Do this at least 6 times until it releases a fine mist of spray into the air  - see picture f .

## If the nasal spray does not seem to be working :

- Check you still have medicine left. Look at the level through the window. If the level is very low there may not be enough left to work the nasal spray.
