The Avastin BERNIE study is part of an approved PIP EMEA-000056-PIP01-07-MO2 for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma.

The  first  patient  was  randomized  in  Study  BO20924  on  29  July  2008.  Patient  recruitment  was completed  on  31  October  2013,  after  a  total  of  154  patients  had  been  randomized.  The  primary analysis  was  EFS,  and  this  CSR  is  based  on  the  clinical  cut  off  of  31  May  2015,  approximately  19 months after the last patient was randomized. Following completion of the analyses included in this CSR,  Study  BO20924  is  continuing  and  patients  will  be  followed  for  a  minimum  of  47  months  for overall survival (OS) and the long-term effects of treatment.

The Sponsor will submit a CSR addendum with the final analysis results (EFS and OS) for the BERNIE study in 2019.

The Avastin BERNIE study failed to meet the primary endpoint and no new safety signals have been identified. Therefore, the MAH will not be seeking an indication nor amending existing indications.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Avastin is provided as an 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion, this is considered an adequate formulation for paediatric use.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a clinical study report for:

- BO20924  (BERNIE) a  randomized,  comparative,  open-label,  multi-center  Phase  II  study evaluating  the  benefit  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  in  children  and adolescent patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study BO20924 (BERNIE)

Open-label,  multi-center,  randomized,  phase  II  study  evaluating  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to chemotherapy in children and adolescent patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma -Report No.: 1065302 .November 2015.

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

## Overall Objective

The objective of Study BO20924 was to evaluate the role of anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab as part of the multi-modality treatment of patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma.

## Primary Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab  to chemotherapy  as compared  to chemotherapy alone in children and adolescent patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)-evaluated Event-Free Survival (EFS)

## Secondary Objectives

To determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone in patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS, as assessed by:

- . Adverse event profile
- . Discontinuation or modification or delay of any treatment element
- . Objective response rate (according to RECIST v1.0) prior to local therapy
- . Overall survival (OS)
- . Duration of response (DoR)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of bevacizumab across all age subsets of the study population

## Exploratory Objective

Correlation of biomarker assessments with risk factors and treatment outcome

## Study design

A  randomized,  comparative,  open-label,  multi-center  Phase  II  study  evaluating  the  benefit  of  the addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  in  children  and  adolescent  patients  presenting  with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the screening assessments were randomized 1:1 to receive combined modality therapy with or without bevacizumab.

## Study population

150  patients  between  6  months  and  18  years  of  age  with  a  histologically  established  diagnosis  of metastatic  or  unresectable  soft  tissue  sarcoma  (STS),  either  rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS)  or  nonrhabdomyosarcoma

## Sample size

STS 150 patients planned. 154 patients enrolled; (74 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm and 80 patients in the Chemo arm).

## Treatments

Patients randomized to the experimental arm received bevacizumab every three weeks at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/week  in  addition  to  chemotherapy  (IVADo)  and  local  therapy  (radiation  and/or  surgery)  as appropriate  during  the  induction  phase.  Bevacizumab  dosing  was  maintained  at  the  same  dose intensity during the maintenance phase with cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

## Primary Endpoints

The primary endpoint of Study BO20924 was EFS, defined as the time between randomization and any of the following:

- Disease progression (as evaluated by a central independent image review committee), or
- Recurrence (as evaluated by a central independent image review committee)
- No documented evidence of response after three cycles of induction chemotherapy (as derived from central independent image review committee visit response data)
- Second primary cancer
- Death due to any cause

## Secondary Endpoints

- Overall response (OR) prior to local therapy, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart
- Overall survival, defined as the time between randomization and death due to any cause

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Duration of Response, defined as time between the first tumor assessment that supported patient's OR and the occurrence of an event contributing to primary EFS.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Exploratory endpoint

Analyses of biomarkers (for available patients), including:

- Correlation of baseline placental growth factor (PlGF)
- Correlation of tumor VEGFA with EFS, OS, and risk factors
- Analyses changes of PlGF over time
- Correlation of PlGF with risk factors

## Pharmacokinetics

## Secondary endpoint

The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  bevacizumab  for  PK-evaluable  paediatric  patients  in  Study  BO20924, using a paediatric population PK model

## Safety

## Secondary endpoint

To determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone in patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS, as assessed by:

- Adverse event analyses.
- Discontinuation or modification or delay of any treatment element

Clinical assessments included:

-  Signs  and  symptoms,  weight,  height  (sitting  and  standing),  head  circumference,  and  menstrual status.
- Reporting of adverse events (AEs) as per NCI CTCAE version 3
- Standard laboratory investigations including hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test when clinically indicated
- Special investigations (ECG) and echocardiography
- X-ray of the left hand, including the wrist (as assessment of epiphyseal/metaphyseal development), and bone age assessments.

## Statistical Methods

## Primary endpoint

·  EFS:  data  for  patients  who  had  not  experienced  an  event  by  the  time  of  clinical  cut-off  (31  May 2015) were censored at the date of the last disease assessment prior to the clinical cut-off date. Data for  patients  who  did  not  have  any  post-baseline  disease  assessments  were censored  at the  time  of randomization.  The  two-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  was  used  to  compare  EFS  between  the  two treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary endpoints:

·  Objective  response  rate:  patients  who  had  no  post-baseline  record  of  tumor  assessment  were counted as non-responders. Patients without measurable disease at baseline were excluded from the analysis.  The  difference  in  objective  response  rate  between  the  treatment  arms  was  tested  in  an exploratory manner, using a chi-square test with Schouten correction.

· Overall survival: data for patients without an event at the time of the clinical cut-off were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. Data for patients who did not have any post-baseline information  were  censored  at  the  date  of  randomization.  The  statistical  methods  used  for  the  OS analysis were the same as those described for the primary endpoint of EFS. As a sensitivity analysis, unstratified analysis of OS was also performed.

·  Duration  of  response:  as  DoR  was  only  calculated  for  patients  who  had  an  objective  response, patients  without  measurable  disease  at  baseline  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  The  censoring method  for  DoR  was  the  same  as  that  for  EFS.  The  Kaplan-Meier  approach  was  used  to  estimate median  DoR  for  each  treatment  arm.  The  95%  CI  of  the  median  DoR  was  estimated  using  the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

The analysis was conducted on the 154 patients in the intent-to-treat population (80 patients in the Chemo arm and 74 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm) unless otherwise specified.

## Baseline data

Baseline  disease  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  study  treatment  arms.  In  terms  of patients'  surgical  status  at  baseline,  the  primary  tumor  was  intact  in  the  majority  of  patients.  The primary tumor was intact in 55/80 patients in the Chemo arm and 53/74 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm. The most common histological subtype of metastatic RMS in the high- risk group was alveolar RMS (31/40 [77.5%] patients in the Chemo arm and 24/38 patients [63.2%] in the Bv + Chemo arm). The most common histological subtype of RMS in the non highrisk group was embryonal RMS (10/13 patients [76.9%] in the Chemo arm and 8/12 [66.7%] patients in the Bv + Chemo arm).

About  one-third  of  patients  had  NRSTS:  26  patients  (32.5%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  23  patients (31.1%) in the Bv + Chemo arm. Among patients with NRSTS, the most common histological subtype diagnosis was desmoplastic small round cell tumor (7/26 patients [26.9%] in the Chemo arm and 5/23 patients [21.7%] in the Bv + Chemo arm).

## Pharmacokinetic results

The PK of bevacizumab for the 70 PK-evaluable paediatric patients from the analysis of Study BO20924 was  well  characterized  by  a  comprehensive  paediatric  PopPK  model  (two-compartment  with  linear elimination  and  allometric  scaling)  consisting  of  data  from  152  paediatric  patients  across  4  clinical studies. The paediatric PopPK model included data from 39 paediatric patients in Study BO20924 that were initially reported in the planned interim Futility Analysis for the study.

Covariates  associated  with  bevacizumab  PK  in  paediatric  patients  were  similar  to  those  found  with adults  with  body  weight  (BW),  sex  (gender),  and  albumin  levels  having  significant  impact  on bevacizumab  exposure.  Compared  to  BW,  body-surface  area  (BSA)  was  not  found  to  significantly improve data fitting by the Paed PopPK mode. Importantly, age was not found to be associated with bevacizumab PK when BW was taken into account. No other PK associated covariates were observed for patients in Study BO20924 based on comparisons of key PK parameters between Ped PopPK final model predictions and estimations of observed data. Due to the influence of BW on PK parameters as described  in  the  comprehensive  Paed  PopPK  model,  there  was  a  trend  toward  lower  concentrations (Cmin and Cmax) and exposure (AUC) as BW decreased.

Based on observed data from the PK-evaluable paediatric patients in Study BO20924, paediatric PopPK predictions of bevacizumab steady-state trough concentrations (Css-min) were generally found to fall within the 90% prediction intervals (90% PI) of adults when administered the same dosing regimen (7.5  mg/kg  q3w  [induction  therapy  phase]).  Although  bevacizumab  concentrations  were  generally lower in paediatric patients than adults, the Paed PopPK model predicted Css-min to be ~30 mcg/mL or  greater,  which  is  similar  to  adults  administered  the  Study  BO20924  dose  regimen.  Bevacizumab steady-state peak concentrations (Css-max) and exposure (AUCss) tended to fall below the 90% PI of adults as BW decreased. The cause for Cmax and AUC to fall below the 90% PI for adults is unknown as there are no adult patients with sarcomas represented in the Adult PopPK model to compare against paediatric patients with sarcomas.

## Efficacy results

## Primary endpoint

No statistically significant improvement was seen in the Bv + Chemo arm over the Chemo arm with respect to the primary endpoint of EFS as assessed by IRC. HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72).

The median EFS was 14.9 months (95% CI 10.8, 35.9) in the Chemo arm and 20.6 months (95% CI 15.2, 24.9) in the Bv + Chemo arm. KM estimate for event-free survival rate at 12 months was 57.0% in the Chemo arm and 75.2% in the Bv + Chemo arm; and at 18 months was 44.3% in the Chemo arm and 54.3% in the Bv + Chemo arm. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves crossed at approximately 24 months after randomization

Four sensitivity analyses of EFS were performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis:

- Investigator-evaluated EFS

Investigator-evaluated EFS was similar to the IRC-evaluated EFS, and was not significantly different between treatment arms: HR was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.07; pvalue = 0.10). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median EFS was 12.5 months (95% CI: 9.3, 18.6) in the Chemo arm and 18.9 months (95% CI: 14.7, 25.4) in the Bv + Chemo arm.

A concordance analysis was performed on the ITT population. The concordance rates (i.e., for EFS events  assessed  with  less  than  14  days  apart  between  investigator  and  IRC  assessment,  or agreement on the absence of event assessed by either) were 63.8% (51/80) for patients in the Chemo arm and 45.9% (34/74) for patients in the Bv + Chemo arm.

For  14  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  22  patients  in  the  Bv+  Chemo  Arm,  the  EFS  event  as assessed  by  IRC  occurred  later  than  the  investigator-assessed  EFS  event.  A  time-sensitive radiological  review  committee  was  responsible  for  the  confirmation  of  the  patient's  status  of 'treatment failure,' after 3 cycles of induction therapy. This review was performed in an ongoing manner at the request of the investigator.

- There  were  7  patients  who  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  having  experienced  insufficient therapeutic response. The investigator's assessment was confirmed by the committee in 5 cases. Unstratified EFS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using a Cox proportional hazards model, the unstratified analysis of the IRC-assessed EFS gave similar results to the stratified analysis: HR was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.48; p-value = 0.94). See table13 above

- IRC-evaluated EFS, censoring EFS at initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer treatment

A sensitivity analysis was performed with data censored at the time patients started a non-protocol anti-cancer therapy (before experiencing an EFS event). This analysis was stratified by age and histology/disease risk. The HR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.49, 1.46; p-value = 0.56). This EFS estimate was consistent with the results of the primary analysis.

- IRC-evaluated EFS, censoring EFS at early discontinuation of all study treatment.

A sensitivity analysis was performed with data censored at the time patients discontinued all study treatment early for any reason (before experiencing an EFS event). This analysis was stratified by age and histology/disease risk. The HR was 1.19 (95% CI 0.74, 1.93; p-value = 0.48).

## Secondary endpoints

## Overall survival

As of the clinical cutoff date, 31 May 2015, 37 patients (46.3%) in the Chemo arm and 34 patients (45.9%) in the Bv + Chemo arm had died. The OS analysis at this stage is not mature as over 50% of the patients are still alive. The HR was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by age and histology/disease risk. The addition of bevacizumab to standard of care chemotherapy did not result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  (HR  0.79,  95%  CI  0.49,  1.26;  p-value  =  0.32) (Table 18). Similar results were obtained from the unstratified analysis.

## Objective Response Rate

Objective  response  prior  to  first  local  therapy  was  defined  as  a  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial response (PR) determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart as assessed by RECIST v1.0. For the ORR analysis, patients without measurable disease at baseline were excluded.

Per  IRC,  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  ORR  was  seen  between  the  two  treatment  arms:  27/75 patients  (36.0%,  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI:  25.2%,  47.9%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  34/63  patients (54.0%, 95% Clopper-Pearson CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv + Chemo arm were assessed as having had a confirmed response prior to receiving any local therapy in Study BO20924. The difference in response rates between arms was 18.0% (95% Hauck-Anderson CI: 0.6%, 35.3%; p-value = 0.04).

## Duration of Response

Twenty-seven patients in the Chemo arm and 34 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm had an objective response  and  were  included  in  the  analysis  of  DoR,  defined  as  the  time  from  the  first  tumor assessment  that  supported  assessment  of  a  confirmed  overall  response,  until  the  occurrence  of  an event contributing to the primary endpoint of EFS. Of the patients included in the DoR analysis, 11/27 patients  (40.7%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  26/34  patients  (76.5%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  had experienced EFS events after their confirmed objective response. The KM curve of DoR in the Chemo arm did not cross 50%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DoR was 17.5 months (BrookmeyerCrowley 95% CI: 12.3, 25.2) in the Bv + Chemo arm. The censoring methods for the DoR analysis were the same as those used for patients in the EFS analysis.

## Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses were performed for IRC-assessed EFS using the following factors: sex, age group, histology/disease  risk,  status  of  primary  tumor,  primary  tumor  type,  and  presence  of  bone  marrow metastases, Karnofsky scale, Lansky Play-Performance Status, and history of local surgery/radiotherapy  during  the  study.  The  results  for  these  subgroups  were  consistent  with  the results of the primary analysis (see Figure 9) except for patients with local surgery and radiotherapy and  patients  without  any  local  therapy.  Due  to  small  numbers  of  patients  in  these  subgroups,  no conclusion could be drawn.

## Subsequent Treatment after Study Treatment Discontinuation

Drug Therapies for Cancer Among the patients in the ITT population, 38 patients in the Chemo arm (47.5%) and 30 patients (40.5%) in the Bv + Chemo arm received subsequent treatment for cancer after discontinuation of study treatment in Study BO20924.

Among the patients in  the  ITT  population,  22  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  (27.5%)  and  18  patients (24.3%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  underwent  additional  radiotherapy  after  discontinuation  of  study treatment in Study BO20924. In the cases where a site was specified, the most common location of therapy was bone (6 patients [7.5%] in the Chemo arm and 4 patients [5.4%] in the Bv + Chemo arm).

Among the patients in  the  ITT  population,  12  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  (15.0%)  and  11  patients (14.9%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  underwent  a  surgical  procedure  after  discontinuation  of  study treatment in Study BO20924. Three patients (3.8%) who had participated in the Chemo arm of Study BO20924 underwent an additional surgical procedure: aspiration biopsy, cystoscopy, and ureteroscopy, respectively. No additional surgical procedures were reported among patients who had participated in the Bv + Chemo arm.

Eleven  patients  (13.8%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  11  patients  (14.9%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm underwent additional surgeries after discontinuation of study treatment.

## Biomarker analyses

Biomarker analyses were performed on patients from the ITT population who consented to participate in the translational research program and for whom samples were available at baseline. A total of 77 patients (48 in the Chemo arm and 29 in the Bv + Chemo arm) had PlGF measurements at baseline and on study (Cycle 5 Day 1) and 52 patients (29 in the Chemo arm and 23 in the Bv + Chemo arm) had tumor VEGF-A (tVEGFA) measurements at baseline.

EFS analysis in the PlGF-evaluable population showed corresponding results to those observed for the ITT population. An HR of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.59) was observed in the Chemo arm vs. the Bv + Chemo arm in the PlGF-evaluable population

The ITT population results overall showed an HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72) (Table 13). Furthermore, no significant change was seen in the EFS analysis comparing the Chemo arm with the Bv + Chemo arm for the baseline high PlGF level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.89), median (HR= 1.22; 95% CI: 0.49. 3.06) and third quartile (HR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.18, 2.71)

OS analysis in the PlGF-evaluable population also showed similar results to those observed for the ITT population:  an  HR  of  0.64  (95%  CI:  0.30,  1.35) was  observed  in  the  Chemo  arm  versus  the  Bv  + Chemo arm in this population (ITT population results: HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.49, 1.26; p-value = 0.32]). No significant change was seen in the OS analysis comparing the Chemo arm with the Bv + Chemo arm for the baseline high PlGF level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.61), median(HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.21, 1.98) and third quartile (HR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.07).

In a Cox regression analysis for OS including trial treatment, baseline biomarker level dichotomized at quartiles  and  the  interaction  term  of  treatment  by  biomarker  level,  there  was  no  indication  of  a treatment by biomarker level interaction.

Based on the limited data, no predictive value could be concluded for baseline PlGF as a biomarker for the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment. Additionally, the correlation was examined between PlGF levels and patient risk factors reported at baseline. A correlation was noted between PlGF levels and bone marrow metastases at baseline. Among the low PlGF level group, 37/39 patients (94.9%) did not have bone  marrow  metastases  vs.  27/38  patients  (71.1%)  in  the  high-PlGF  group  (p  =  0.01).  Another correlation was also noted between PlGF levels and histology/disease risk at baseline. Among the high

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PlGF level group, 27/38 patients (71.1%) had high risk metastatic RMS, 4/38 patients (10.5%) had NRSTS  and  7/38  patients  (18.4%)  had  non-high  risk  metastatic  RMS  vs.  14/39  patients  (35.9%), 20/39 (51.3%), and 5/39 (12.8%), respectively, in the low PlGF level group (&lt; p = 0.01).

Previous  biomarker  analyses  have  described  an  increase  in  the  circulating  concentration  of  PlGF  in response to VEGF-targeted treatment as a pharmacodynamic marker but not as a predictive marker (Batchelor  2006,  Rini  2008,  Willett  2009).  In  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  no  increase  in  PlGF  levels  was observed from baseline to Cycle 5 Day 1 and maintenance therapy Cycle 5 Day1.

Analyses of EFS and OS by tVEGFA (IHC assessed) shows a HR of 1.48 (95% CI: 0.67, 3.28) and for OS analysis  it  was  0.91  (95%  CI:  0.38,  2.19)  in  the  Chemo  arm  vs.  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  in  the tVEGFA-evaluable  population.  Furthermore,  no  significant  change  was  seen  for  the  baseline  high tVEGFA level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 0.50, 4.39) and median (HR= 1.36; 95% CI: 0.36, 5.10) for EFS analysis, as well for the OS analysis dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.25, 2.87) and median (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.20, 3.28).

In  a  Cox  regression  analysis  for  OS  including  trial  treatment,  baseline  biomarker  level  and  the interaction term of treatment by biomarker level, there was no indication of a treatment by biomarker level interaction. Based on the limited data, no predictive value could be concluded for baseline tVEGFA as a biomarker for the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment.

## Safety results

Of the 154 patients in the Intent-to-Treat population, 4 patients did not receive any study treatment. The remaining 150 patients were included in the safety-evaluable population (79 in the Chemo arm and 71 in the Bv + Chemo arm).

Key safety data include the following:

Overall, the toxicity profile observed in Study BO20924 patients appears to be that which might be expected  in  adults  exposed  to  bevacizumab  and  the  chemotherapy  backbone  in  the  disease  under study. All patients in the safety-evaluable population experienced at least one adverse event (AE). No fatal AEs were reported. All deaths were attributed to disease progression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

68 of 79 patients (86.1%) in the Chemo arm and 66 of 71 patients (93.0%) in the Bv + Chemo arm experienced at least one SAE. The SAEs that were reported at an incidence &gt; 5% in patients receiving Bv + Chemo were:

- Febrile neutropenia (46 patients [64.8%])
- Febrile bone marrow aplasia (19 patients [26.8%])
- Pyrexia (14 patients [19.7%])
- Mucosal inflammation (10 patients [14.1%])
- Vomiting (8 patients [11.3%])
- Weight decreased (5 patients [7.0%])
- Anaemia (4 patients [5.6%])
- Neutropenic infection (4 patients [5.6%])
- Seizure (4 patients [5.6%])
- Diarrhea (4 patients [5.6%])
- Decreased appetite (4 patients [5.6%]).

AEs that led to study chemotherapy discontinuation were reported in a total of 12 patients: 6  patients in the Chemo arm and 6 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm.  AEs that led to bevacizumab discontinuation were reported in a total of 8 patients (left ventricular dysfunction most commonly reported as causing discontinuation [3/8 patients]).

79 patients [100%] in the Chemo arm and 70 patients [98.6%] in the Bv + Chemo armexperienced at least one Grade 3 -5 AE. The total numbers of Grade 3-5 AEs were higher in the Bv + Chemo arm. Three Grade ≥ 3  AEs  were  reported  with  at  least  a  10%  difference  in  frequency  between  treatment arms: neutropenia, anaemia, and febrile bone marrow aplasia, which were all more frequently reported in the Bv + Chemo arm. Forty-six patients (64.8%) in the Bv + Chemo arm experienced at least one adverse event of special interest (AESI), versus 32 patients (40.5%) in the Chemo arm. The rate of ≥ Grade 3 AESIs was equivalent between the two study treatment arms: 12.7% in each arm.

As of the clinical cutoff date, no pregnancies had been reported on study.

Bone toxicity was monitored by qualitative observations from X-rays of the patient's left wrist and the development of any skeletal abnormalities, as indicated by the occurrence of symptoms, in particular pain  associated  with  bones  or  joints.  More  patients  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  (16  of  71  patients [22.5%]): than in the Chemo arm (12 of 79 patients [15.2%]) arm experienced at least one qualifying bone toxicity AE. Among these, the most common bone toxicities were arthralgia (10 patients [14.1%] in the Bv + Chemo arm vs. 8 patients [10.1%] in the Chemo arm); bone pain (4 patients [5.6%] in the Bv + Chemo arm vs. 2 patients [2.5%] in the Chemo arm); and foot fracture (2 patients [2.8%] in the Bv + Chemo arm vs. no patients in the Chemo arm). No AEs of osteonecrosis were reported in either treatment arm.

Seventy-nine patients in the Chemo arm (median height 147.0 cm) and 70 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm  (median  height  147.0  cm)  were  evaluated  for  standing  height  at  baseline  from  the  safetyevaluable population. At follow-up, 19 patients (24.1%) in the Chemo arm and 17 patients (23.9%) in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  were  evaluated  as  pre-pubertal.  No  clear  pattern  was  observed  on  standing height between arms.

At baseline, 49 patients in the Chemo arm and 40 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm were evaluated for sitting  height.  Too  few  patients  (fewer  than  20  in  either  arm  at  any  time  point  after  baseline)  had subsequent  evaluations  performed  to  allow  conclusions  to  be  drawn  regarding  differences  between treatment arms in changes from baseline. The difference in sample sizes between standing/lying and sitting height was mainly due to the patients' clinical status but also to the difficulty of measuring siting height in a population of young patients

## 2.3.3. Conclusion on clinical aspects

As also concluded by the MAH Study BO20924 did not meet its primary endpoint of improved EFS in the Bv + Chemo arm. HR for IRC-assessed EFS was estimated as 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72).  Per  IRC,  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  ORR  was  seen  between  the  two  treatment  arms: 27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the Chemo arm and 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv + Chemo arm were assessed as having had a confirmed response prior to receiving any local therapy in Study BO20924.

Additional  subgroup  analysis  performed  for  the  IRC  assessed  EFS  were  consistent  with  the  primary analysis with the exception of patients with local surgery radiotherapy and patients without any local therapy. Due to small numbers of patients in these subgroups, no conclusion could be drawn.

Biomarker analyses did not show any useful results.

The  safety  profile  observed  in  Study  BO20924  patients  appeared  to  be  largely  consistent  with  that which might be expected in adults exposed to bevacizumab and/or the chemotherapy backbone in the disease. The Pharmacokinetics of paediatric patients in Study BO20924 were well characterized by a paediatric  PopPK  model,  with  similar  PK-associated  covariates  as  in  adults,  and  with  the  expected bevacizumab PK with a slow systemic clearance, volume of distribution that approximates the plasma volume, and long half-life.

. An addendum CSR is expected to be generated in the third quarter of 2019, when the OS endpoint has been reached and Study BO20924 has been completed. Updated OS results as well as safety data will be made available at that time and the benefit-risk reassessed.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

Roche  Registration  Ltd  has  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Avastin  in  accordance  with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The provided study, BO20924 (BERNIE), a randomized,  comparative,  open-label,  multi-center  Phase  II  study  evaluating  the  benefit  of  the addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  in  children  and  adolescent  patients  presenting  with metastatic  rhabdomyosarcoma  and  non-rhabdomyosarcoma  soft  tissue  sarcoma,  did  not  meet  its primary endpoint of improved EFS in the Bv + Chemo arm. It is agreed, that based on the presented data, the benefit-risk of the addition of bevacizumab to multimodal therapy in this population is not possible to assess. When the updated OS results as well as safety data will be made available in 2019 re-assessment  may  be  conducted  in  order  to  further  pursue  the  benefit  risk  in  the  metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma indication. The MAH has indicated that a variation is to be submitted in 2016 in order to update the SmPC with paediatric data. This is endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fulfilled:

No further action required, however, further data are expected in 2016 in the context of a variation to update section 4.2 Posology, 4.8 Undesirable effects, 5.1 Pharmacodynamic, 5.2 Pharmacokinetic, 5.3 Pre-clinical safety data) in order to provide patients and healthcare professionals with the most up to date paediatric information, and fulfil the obligations for the Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIP1 EMEA000056-PIP01-07-MO2 and PIP2 EMEA-000056-PIP03-10-MO2).

Updated OS data is still expected to be submitted as stated, in 2019.
