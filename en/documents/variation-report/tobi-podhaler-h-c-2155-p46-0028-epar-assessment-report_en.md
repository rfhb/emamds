## 1. Introduction

On 10 November 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tobramycin inhalation powder, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH states that the efficacy and safety data from study CTBM100DDE03 do not warrant an update of the product information of TOBI Podhaler.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that CTBM100DDE03 , An observational study to assess Treatment Satisfaction of patients  with  Cystic  Fibrosis  applying  TOBI  Podhaler,  with  particular  reference  to  Time  saving, Improved Hygiene, and Portability (EASE) , is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The dose was 112 mg tobramycin (4x 28mg capsules), administered twice daily for 28 days followed by 28 days off treatment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- study CTBM100DDE03: An observational study to assess Treatment Satisfaction of patients with  Cystic  Fibrosis  applying  TOBI  Podhaler,  with  particular  reference  to  Time  saving, Improved Hygiene, and Portability (EASE)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study  CTBM100DDE03:  An  observational  study  to  assess  Treatment  Satisfaction  of patients with Cystic Fibrosis applying TOBI Podhaler, with particular reference to Time saving, Improved Hygiene, and Portability (EASE)

## Description

The EASE study is a prospective, non-interventional study - aimed to evaluate therapy satisfaction, changes  in  compliance,  and  efficacy  of  TOBI  Podhaler®  and  to  gather  specific  characteristics (anamnesis, antibiotic pretreatment, accompanying diseases, concomitant medication) of patients suffering from CF and was conducted in 30 specialized CF centers in Germany.

Out of the 16 patients that were enrolled in the study, 3 patients were paediatric patients.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

- Assessment of therapy satisfaction of patients treated with the new TOBI Podhaler®
- Evaluation of specific characteristics of patients suffering from CF combined with P. aeruginosa infection, their medical history, antibiotic pretreatments, accompanying

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

diseases, concomitant medication, as well as safety and tolerability of the therapy in daily life

- Assessment of the efficacy of the TOBI Podhaler® in daily life
- Evaluation of the compliance and its change during the use of the TOBI Podhaler® in comparison to the prior, traditionally used nebulizer

## CHMP comment

The objectives seem appropriate to evaluate treatment satisfaction.

## Study design

This was a non-interventional, multicenter, observational study according to the definition of noninterventional studies (under daily clinical routine care). The examination of the questions specified under  'objectives'  allowed  an  assessment  with  a  relative  high  number  of  patients  as  close  as possible to the daily medical treatment.

The purpose of this study was the assessment of the newly introduced TOBI Podhaler® in a broad patient  collective  in  the  everyday  routine.  At  the  beginning  of  the  observational  study,  each participating physician received one physician questionnaire per patient. A special patient-related questionnaire was handed out to every partaking patient.

The  analysis  of  therapy  satisfaction  and  compliance  was  carried  out  by  means  of  the  special patient-related  questionnaire  and  the  analogous  parts  of  the  physician  questionnaire  after completion of the treatment. For the evaluation of effectiveness the value of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were used.

## Study population

Any  patient  with  a  diagnosis  of  CF  and  at  a  minimum  age  of  6  who  was  prescribed  the  TOBI Podhaler® for the first time was suitable for this study.

Aside from the signed consent form the exclusion criteria were limited to contraindications of TOBI Podhaler® described in the SmPC.

## Sample size

It was intended to document prospectively the treatment course of at least 120 patients in total, all characterized by the minimum age of 6 and suffering from CF.

## CHMP comment

No rationale for the planned  sample size of 120 patients was provided.

## Treatments

Patients received four TIP capsules (112 mg of tobramycin, 28 mg / capsule) twice a day, within alternate cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days without treatment. The observation period was 12 months.

During the observation period of 12 months, visits should take place approximately every 3 months according to standard treatment routine. Time point of visits was not specified relating to on / off phase.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Parameters of special interest were:

- Therapy satisfaction and factors for therapy satisfaction
- Therapy compliance
- Effectiveness of therapy
- Evaluation of specific characteristics of patients suffering from CF
- Collection  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  containing  information  on  intensity,  seriousness, outcome and causality.

## Statistical Methods

This  NIS  was  analyzed  with  epidemiological  methods  using  descriptive,  statistical  procedures. Analyses were conducted using Microsoft Office Excel, 2013.

According  to  confidentiality  guidelines,  no  data  that  could  be  directly  assigned  to  patients  were recorded.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 16 patients were enrolled from May 2012 to January 2013. As is obvious from Table 3-1 the obtained data was incomplete. Complete data sets were obtained for three patients, only. For two  patients  no  physician  data  were  available  and  for  one  patient  the  data  from  the  patient questionnaire were lacking.

## CHMP comment:

Patients  were  enrolled  between  April  2012  and  January  2013,  in  August  2013,  the  study  was cancelled  due  to  low  recruitment.  As  there  were  very  little  patients  enrolled  (N=16),  and  the collected  data  is  incomplete  for  the  far  majority  of  these  patients,  the  result  can  only  be descriptive.

## Baseline data

Demographic data of 14 patients collected at the first visit are shown in Table 3-2.

64%  of  patients  were  male  (N=9/14)  and  36%  female  (N=5/14).  The  mean  age  ±  standard deviation (SDM) was 25.6 ± 8.6 years (median: 26.5 years). The youngest patient was 13 years old and the oldest patient 42 years of age. The average height of patients was 168.9 ± 7.8 cm (median: 168.5 cm). The average weight of patients was 58.0 ± 11.9 kg (median: 62.0 kg).

## Efficacy results

- Assessment of therapy satisfaction of patients treated with the new TOBI Podhaler®

At Visit 1 the patients (N=15) were asked to rate five distinct features of the TOBI Podhaler® that may contribute to therapy contentment (Table 3-8). Features valuated with scores of 2 or greater were considered to be important.

Table 3-8:Rating of desirable attributes of TOBl Podhalerby users (Visit 1, N=15).

Evaluation of desirable attributes by using scores from not important (1) to very important (10).

Patients evaluated nearly all suggested features of TOBI Podhaler® - 93% (N=14/15) the small size,  93%  (N=14/15)  the  shorter  inhalation  time,  100%  (N=15/15)  the  simple  usage,  100% (N=15/15) the simple cleaning, and 100% (N=15/15) no requirement for cooling - as essential. The comparison of the mean scores of the distinct features points out, that a simple cleaning (9.2 ± 0.8) and a short inhalation time (9.1 ± 2.3) are most important for the asked patients. Also very important are the simple usage (8.3 ± 1.6) and no cooling needed (8.1 ± 2.2), followed by the small size of the device (7.5 ± 2.4).

## CHMP comment:

The  main  positive  attributes  of  TOBI  Podhaler®  reported  by  the  patients  included  in  this  study were shorter inhalation times compared with nebulizers, fast and easy cleaning of the device, and no refrigerator needed. No separate analysis was performed for paediatric vs adult patients.

For  93%  of  all  patients  (N=13/14)  an  infection  with  P.  aeruginosa  was  recorded  at  Visit  1.  An intermittent infection was present in 14% of patients (N=2/14), whereas 64% of patients (N=9/14) suffered  from  a  chronic  infection  with  P.  aeruginosa.  For  22%  of  patients  (N=3/14)  the  type  of infection could not be specified. All included patients (N=14/14) had been previously treated with inhaled antibiotics. In this respect, 86% of patients (N=12/14) had been treated with Tobramycin, 36% (N=5/14) with Colistin, and 7% (N=1/14) with Aztreonam. The different types of inhalation

were  continuous  treatment  for  21%  of  patients  (N=3/14),  an  application  in  cycles  for  71%  of patients (N=10/14), or not specified for 7% of patients (N=1/14), respectively.

## CHMP comment:

As TOBI Podhaler is indicated for 'the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in  adults and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis', it is noted that 1 patient does not seem to have an infection with P. aeruginosa . The reason for TOBI Podhaler prescription in this patient is not reported in the clinical study report.

- Assessment of the efficacy of the TOBI Podhaler® in daily life

Therapy  effectiveness  in  daily  life  of  TOBI  Podhaler®  was  assessed  by  determination  of  lung function (spirometry), e. g. forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), vital capacity (VC) and peak  expiratory  flow  (PEF).  The  time  point  of  spirometric  assessments,  regarding  Tobramycin treatment cycle, was not specified. Thus, lung function data can derive from the 4 week treatment phase and the 4 week inhalation break, respectively.

Table 3-4 shows an overview of the development of mean FEV1, VC and PEF from Visit 1-5 as percentage of predicted and as percentage of Baseline. Values for predicted FEV1, VC and PEF were determined  according  to  C.-P.  Criée  (Criée  et  al.,  2006)  for  patients  18  years  and  older  and according to Polgar (Polgar and Weng, 1979) for adolescents.

Lung function at Baseline varied heavily between single patients, e. g. ranging from 27% to 109% of predicted FEV1 at Visit 1. Within these broad interindividual differences, mean lung function of patients remained relatively constant throughout the study.

| VC          | [%ofBaseline]    | 100±0     | 96± 22    | 93± 19    | 96±17     | 91±17     |

| PEF         | [%of Baseline]   | 100±0     | 86 ± 27   | 90± 25    | 105±16    | 94 ± 29   |

Mean FEV1 of predicted was 63 ± 24% at Visit 1 (N=14) and changed to 54 ± 19% at the end of the study (N=10), representing 91 ± 23% of Baseline FEV1. Mean VC was 80 ± 21% of predicted at  study  start  (N=14)  and  changed  to  69  ±  12% at  Visit  5  (N=10),  representing  91  ±  17%  of Baseline VC. Mean PEF changed from 95 ± 47% of predicted at Visit 1 (N=12) to 76 ± 21% at Visit 5 (N=8).

## CHMP comment:

No conclusions should be drawn based on the limited number of patients included, but overall lung function suggests to be relatively stable throughout the 12 months observation period.

- Evaluation  of  the  compliance  and  its  change  during  the  use  of  the  TOBI  Podhaler®  in comparison to the prior, traditionally used nebulizer

Current compliance vs. expected compliance with TOBI Podhaler®

The current inhalation and cleaning compliance with previous used devices as well as the expected inhalation compliance with the TOBI Podhaler® were assessed and rated by the physicians for each patient  at  Visit  1.  Patients  rated  with  a  score  of  6  or  greater  were  considered  to  have  a  good compliance. The results of the assessments are summarized in Table 3-10.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

75% (N=9/12) of patients were considered to have a good current inhalation  compliance.  83% (N=10/12) of patients were considered to have a good current cleaning compliance. The expected inhalation  compliance  with  the  TOBI  Podhaler®  was  rated  to  be  good  for  100%  (N=12/12)  of patients.

Change in compliance with the TOBI Podhaler®

The  inhalation  compliance  of  the  participating  patients  (N=10)  was  again  evaluated  by  the physicians  at  the  end  of  the  study.  At  Visit  5  physicians  were  asked  to  rate  the  changes  in inhalation compliance of their patients. These changes in compliance are depicted as bar chart in Figure 3-1.

Figure3-1:ChangeincomplianceatVisit5,N=10

<!-- image -->

The use of the TOBI Podhaler® has not caused a worsening in the inhalation compliance of any patient (N=0/10). In 40% (N=4/10) of patients the treatment with the TOBI Podhaler® had no effect on the inhalation compliance, whereas in 50% (N=5/10) of patients use of the new device

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

induced  a  significant  improvement.  A  strong  improvement  was  stated  for  10%  (N=1/10)  of patients.

## Self-assessment of compliance

At Visit 2 the patients (N=14) were requested to perform a self-assessment of compliance based on  answering  yes/no  questions  and  on  their  inhalation  data  of  4  weeks.  Positive  answers  were counted and are summarized in Table 3-11. Mean values of the inhalation data can be found in Table 3-12.

| How many time do you need between inhalation of two capsules [min]? |    1   |   0.8 |

During the first 4 weeks of using the TOBI Podhaler® the patients (N=12-14) did not inhale on 0.8 ± 1.5 days and inhaled a reduced dose on 0.8 ± 1.7 days. In average, patients needed 1.8 ± 0.9 breaths per capsule and 1.0 ± 0.8 minutes between inhalation of two capsules.

## CHMP comment:

Compliance suggested to remain stable or improved compared to the prior nebulizer.

## Safety results

For the safety population, 16 patients were analysed. A total of 17 adverse events was reported in 7 patients (41.2%). The incidence of non serious not related AE's was 41.2%. Non serious ADRs occurred in 5.9% of patients. No SAEs or SADR were reported.

## CHMP comment

Based upon the safety results of the 16 patients enrolled, no new safety signals are identified. The reported AEs were most often of moderate severity and considered either not related or causality could not be assessed.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  aim  of  this  observational  study  was  the  assessment  of  TOBI  Podhaler®  in  a  broad  patient collective in the everyday routine. This aim could however not be realized as only 16 out of the planned 120 patients were enrolled. As no conclusions can be drawn based on such low enrolment, it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  product  information  of  TOBI  Podhaler  does  not  warrant  an update based on the results from study CTBM100DDE03.
