## 1. Introduction

On the 14 th  May 2019, the MAH submitted the final study report, including 6-month safety follow-up data, for the study Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 2016-000598-19) to comply with the requirements of Art 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

Rota-081 is a phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical consistency of 3 production lots of the Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals'(GSK) oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK's HRV vaccine as compared to the currently licensed lyophilised formulation of the HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a 2-dose vaccination in healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks. Note that 'PCVfree' is defined as no detection of PCV-1 and PCV-2 according to the limit of detection of the tests used'.

A short critical expert overview is also provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

GSK has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of Study Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 2016-000598-19) to comply with the requirements of Art 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

GSK plans to submit a Type II variation, composed of quality and clinical sections, to license the PCVfree manufacturing process of Rotarix and to meet the last part of the condition of the Rotarix Marketing Authorisation (EU Product Information Annex II, Part D, Obligation to conduct postauthorisation measures):

'In order to address the presence of porcine circovirus type 1(PCV-1) in Rotarix, the MAH commits to:

- -Provide, on a 6-month basis, updates on the progress being made on the activities set out in the implementation plan for the development of a PCV-free vaccine, as agreed by CHMP on 15 September 2016: every June and December until the PCVfree Rotarix application.Submit an application at the latest in 2020 to amend the particulars of the marketing authorisation in order to render the medicinal product PCV-free'.

The Rota-081 study results will be part of this variation to demonstrate the clinical comparability between the current and PCV-free Rotarix vaccines, on top of the technical comparability data.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 2016-000598-19) Description

A phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical consistency of 3 production lots of the Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals'(GSK) oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK's HRV vaccine as compared to the currently licensed lyophilised formulation of the HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a 2dose vaccination in healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks.

The study was conducted at 66 centres in 8 countries: 2 in Costa Rica, 10 in Finland, 6 in Germany, 7 in Japan, 6 in Republic of Korea, 9 in Spain, 6 in Taiwan and 20 in the US.

## Methods

Objectives

## Co-Primary objectives :

- [ ]  To de m onstra te  th e  lo t -to-lot consistency of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity as measured by serum anti-rotavirus (RV) immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody concentrations 1-2 months after Dose 2.

Consistency was demonstrated if, for all pairs of lots, the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), 1-2 months after Dose 2, was within the (0.5, 2) clinical limit interval.

- [ ]  To de m onstra te  th e  im m u n o lo g ica l n o n -inferiority of PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine as compared to the currently licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of seroconversion rates 1-2 months after Dose 2.

Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided asymptotic standardised 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine was greater than or equal to -10%.

- [ ]  To de m onstra te  th e  n o n -inferiority of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine to that of the currently licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations 1-2 months after Dose 2.

Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs, 1-2 months after Dose 2 between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and the lyophilised HRV vaccine was greater than or equal to 0.67.

- [ ]  S a fe t y  m o n it o r in g :  An   I n d e p e n d e n t  Da t a  Mo n it o r in g  Co m m it t e e  ( IDMC)  co m p r is in g clinical experts and a biostatistician, reviewed the cumulative, unblinded safety data on a regular basis during the study. Since no safety concerns were raised, the study continued as planned.

Number of subjects (planned and analysed):

The target enrolment was 1600 subjects (400 subjects in each group) to obtain at least 1280 evaluable subjects (320 subjects in each group) for the evaluation of the co-primary objectives, assuming that approximately 20% of the enrolled subjects were not evaluable. The actual number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of HRV vaccine was 1600 (400 subjects in Liq\\_A, 396 subjects in Liq\\_B, 402 subjects in Liq\\_C and 402 subjects in Lyo groups), comprising the Exposed set (ES).

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

The study was conducted in healthy male or female infants as established by medical history and clinical examination, who were 6-12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination, born full-term (i.e. between a gestation period of 37 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks 6 days). Written informed consent was obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects at the time of study entry.

Exclusion criteria essentially consisted of administration of vaccines not foreseen by the study protocol, previous vaccination against RV, administration of immunoglobulins, immune-modifying drugs or immunosuppressant medications, a potential reaction or hypersensitivity to the HRV vaccine components and significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease or uncorrected gastrointestinal malformation or intussusception (IS). Subjects with previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE or with GE within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration were excluded.

## Duration of study:

The duration of the study, per subject, was approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of extended safety follow-up period after the last dose of HRV vaccine.

## Criteria for evaluation:

Primary endpoints

- [ ]  Evaluation of immunogenicity in terms of anti-RV antibody concentrations.

- [ ]  Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations expressed as GMCs 1-2 months after Dose 2 in each of the HRV liquid formulation groups (Liq\\_A, Liq\\_B and Liq\\_C).

- [ ]  Anti-RV IgA antibody seroconversion rate* 1-2 months after Dose 2 in the lyophilised and pooled liquid groups.

- [ ]  Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations expressed as GMCs 1-2 months after Dose 2 in the lyophilised and pooled liquid groups.

*Seroconversion rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e. with anti-RV IgA antibody concentration &lt;20 U/mL prior the first dose of HRV vaccine) and developed anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL at Visit 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary endpoints

- [ ]  Solicited AEs

- [ ]  Occurrence of each solicited general AE within the 8 days (Day 1-Day 8) follow-up period after each dose of the lyophilised and PCV-free HRV liquid vaccine

- [ ]  Unsolicited AEs.

- [ ]  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs within 31 days (Day 1-Day 31) after any dose of HRV vaccine, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification.

- [ ]  SAEs

- [ ]  Occurrence of SAEs from Dose 1 up to study end.

- [ ]  Evaluation of immunogenicity in terms of anti-RV antibody concentrations.

- [ ]  Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations ≥90 U/mL 1-2 months after Dose 2in the lyophilised and pooled liquid groups.

Statistical methods:

Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol amendment 1 (dated 9 March 2017) and the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Amendment 1 (dated 5 February 2018).

Analysis sets

- [ ]  ES

- [ ]  Per-protocol analysis set (PPS) of immunogenicity

Analysis of immunogenicity

The primary analysis was based on the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity. As the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity was 5% or more, a second analysis based on the ES was performed to complement the PPS analysis.

Between groups assessment

To control risk of concluding erroneously due to the multiple co-primary objectives, a hierarchical procedure was used with a 2.5% type I error.

- [ ]  The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between any pair of the 3 lots of the HRV liquid vaccine was computed (first co-primary objective).

- [ ]  The asymptotic standardised 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and lyophilised HRV vaccine was computed (second co-primary objective conclusive only if the first co-primary objective was reached).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- [ ]  The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and lyophilised HRV vaccine was computed (third co-primary objective conclusive only if the second co-primary objective was reached).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analysis of safety

The ES was used for the analysis of safety. Descriptive summaries were generated via the percentage by group and associated exact 95% CI. Further details on the statistical methods and derivations are available in the SAP.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This phase IIIA, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multi-country study demonstrated the lot-tolot consistency of 3 production lots of the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK's oral live attenuated HRV vaccine and its non-inferiority compared to current licensed lyophilised formulation in terms of immunogenicity.

In addition, the study showed that the administration of PCV-free liquid and current licensed lyophilised formulation did not raise any safety concerns and that PCV-free liquid and current licensed lyophilised formulation have a similar reactogenicity and safety profile.

The Assessor has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of Study Rota-081 based on the dossier submitted and has concluded that the data do not influence the benefit-risk balance and are in line with the approved Product Information for Rotarix in the EU. Therefore, no changes to the current SmPC i.e. Annex I of the EU Product Information, for Rotarix are considered necessary.

&lt;Rapporteur's&gt;&lt;CHMP&gt; overall conclusion and recommendation

1 Serious Adverse Event: Intussusception

Subject received 2 doses of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine. At 8 months of age, 132 days after receiving the second dose of vaccination, the subject experienced frequent vomiting, and was hospitalised the following day. The subject was diagnosed with moderate IS (Grade 2 SAE). The subject was treated with high-pressure enema, followed by intravenous administration of a combination of glucose, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, and a combination of calcium chloride, glucose, potassium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium chloride. The subject was discharged from the hospital 134 days after receiving the second dose of vaccination. In the opinion of the investigator, IS was considered not related to the study vaccine. The SAE was considered resolved, with an outcome of recovery on Day 134, after the second dose of vaccination.
