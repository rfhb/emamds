## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Ketoconazole  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme  and  P-gp  transporter.  Pharmacokinetics  of medicines that are substrates of CYP3A4 and P-gp can be affected when administered concomitantly with ketoconazole, potentially leading to serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and/or need for dose adjustment  of  these  medicinal  products.  The  PRAC  considers  that,  in  view  of  the  available  data  the interaction  of  ketoconazole  with  edoxaban  and  isavuconaziole  should  be  added  to  the  product information.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing ketoconazole were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
