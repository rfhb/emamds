Adult patients -Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency of either childhoodor adult-onset aetiology. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Patients with severe growth hormone deficiency in adulthood are defined as patients with known hypothalamic-pituitary pathology and at least one additional known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency. In patients with childhood-onset isolated growth hormone deficiency (no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests should be recommended, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations (&lt; 2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test. The cut-off point of the dynamic test should be strict.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy with Valtropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians adequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth hormone deficiency.

## Posology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dosage and administration schedule should be individualised for each patient.

## Dosage in paediatric population

## Growth hormone deficiency in children

The recommended dosage is 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day.

## Children with Turner syndrome

The recommended dosage is 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day, given as a subcutaneous injection.

## Pre-pubertal children with chronic renal insufficiency

The recommended dosage is 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day, given as a subcutaneous injection.

<!-- image -->

Dosage in adult patients Growth hormone deficiency in adults The recommended starting dose is 0.15 - 0.30 mg/day, given as a subcutaneous injection. A lower starting dose may be necessary in older and obese patients. This dose should be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-1 concentrations. Total daily dose usually does not exceed 1 mg. IGF-1 concentrations should be maintained below the upper limit of the age-specific normal range. The minimum effective dose should be used. The dosage of somatropin should be decreased in cases of persistent oedema or severe paresthesia, in order to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. Experience of prolonged treatment (over 5 years) with somatropin in adults is limited. Special populations Elderly Experience of somatropin treatment in patients above 60 years of age is limited. A lower starting dose may be necessary in older patients. Dose requirements may decline with increasing age. Renal impairment Currently available data on renal insufficiency are described in section 4.4, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of somatropin clearance has been noted. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown.

## Method of administration

Valtropin is administered by subcutaneous injection.

The injection sites should be varied in order to avoid lipo-atrophy.

For further information on reconstitution and administration see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (e.g. metacresol) (see section 4.4).
- -Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth.
- -Valtropin should not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses.
- -Patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or patients having acute respiratory failure.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2).

## Pituitary

There is no evidence to suspect that growth hormone replacement influences the recurrence rate or regrowth of intracranial neoplasms, but standard clinical practice requires regular pituitary imaging in patients with a history of pituitary pathology. A baseline scan is recommended in these patients before instituting growth hormone replacement therapy. Tumour control If the patient has had a brain tumour, the patient should be re-examined frequently to make sure that the tumour has not come back. In childhood cancer survivors, a higher risk of a second neoplasm (benign or malignant) has been reported in patients treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumours, in particular, were the most common of these second neoplasms. Intracranial hypertension In cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. Insulin sensitivity Because human growth hormone may induce a state of insulin resistance, patients treated with somatropin should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. Thyroid function Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and may, as such, unmask incipient hypothyroidism. Monitoring of thyroid function should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism, standard replacement therapy must be closely monitored when somatropin therapy is administered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Slipped capital epiphyse

Patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, may develop slipped capital epiphyses more frequently. Any child with the onset of a limp during growth hormone therapy should be evaluated.

## Growth hormone deficiency after epiphyseal closure

Subjects who had been treated with growth hormone during childhood, until final height was attained, should be re-evaluated for growth hormone deficiency after epiphyseal closure before replacement therapy is commenced at the doses recommended for adults.

## Treatment after the end of growth in children

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For children, the treatment should be continued until the end of the growth has been reached. It is advisable not to exceed the recommended dosage in view of the potential risks of acromegaly, hyperglycaemia, and glucosuria.

## Prader-Willi syndrome

Valtropin is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. There have been reports of sleep apnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection.

## Renal insufficiency

Before instituting treatment with somatropin for growth retardation secondary to chronic renal insufficiency, children should have been followed for one year to verify growth disturbance. Conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, and nutritional status for one year prior to the treatment) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment. Treatment with somatropin should be discontinued at the time of renal transplantation.

Valtropin should not be reconstituted with the supplied solvent for patients with a known sensitivity to metacresol. If sensitivity to the accompanying solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with water for injections and used as a single use vial (see section 6.3).

Gender and dosing In order to reach the defined treatment goal, men may need lower growth hormone doses than women. Oral oestrogen administration increases the dose requirements in women. An increasing sensitivity to growth hormone (expressed as change in IGF-1 per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, particularly in men. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months. Turner syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear or hearing disorders. Pancreatitis in children Children treated with somatropin have an increased risk of developing pancreatitis compared to adults treated with somatropin. Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop abdominal pain. Accidental intramuscular injection After accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may appear. Any unwanted reaction should be followed. No special treatment is recommended. Sensitivity to metacresol Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Excessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of human growth hormone. Patients with co-existing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth.

In women taking oral oestrogens, a higher dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the treatment goal.

Patients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with somatropin. An adjustment of the insulin dose may be required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults, suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

For Valtropin no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryofoetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Therefore Valtropin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

Very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data), including isolated reports

There have been no clinical studies conducted with Valtropin in breast-feeding women. It is not known whether somatropin is excreted in human milk. Therefore caution should be exercised when Valtropin is administered to breast-feeding women. Fertility No data on fertility are available. Animal data showed no effect on fertility parameters. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Valtropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most common frequent adverse reactions are associated with the injection site, of endocrine nature, and headache, paresthesia and joint pain and disorder (arthralgia) in adults. During clinical studies 128 children (98 children with growth hormone deficiency and 30 with Turner syndrome) were exposed to Valtropin. The safety profile of Valtropin observed in these clinical studies was consistent with that reported with the reference medicinal product used in these studies and other somatropin containing medicinal products. The following adverse reactions and their frequencies have been observed under treatment with somatropin based on published information: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a clinical study with Valtropin, 3% of children with growth hormone deficiency developed antibodies to somatropin. The binding capacity of these antibodies was low and there was no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in any patient who fails to respond to therapy.

Anti-host cell protein (antiS. cerevisiae ) antibodies were uncommon in patients treated with Valtropin. The generation of such antibodies with low binding capacity is unlikely to be clinically relevant. In contrast to bacteria ( E. coli ), yeast has not been described to elicit adjuvant effects modifying the immunological response.

## Paediatric population

Mild and transient oedema was observed early during the course of treatment with somatropin.

## Adult patients

In adult patients with adult-onset growth hormone deficiency, oedema, muscle pain, joint pain and disorders were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient.

4.9 Overdose Acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms of acromegaly consistent with the known effects of excess human growth hormone. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is recommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and somatropin agonists; ATC code: H01AC01 Somatropin is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the medicinal product is identical to that of human growth hormone of pituitary origin. Valtropin is synthesised in yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). The biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of human growth hormone of pituitary origin. The most prominent effect of somatropin is that it stimulates the growth plates of long bones. Additionally, it promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention.

Somatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol.

Somatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in growth hormone-deficient patients, in that body fat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth hormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density.

Somatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance.

## Clinical studies

The efficacy and safety of Valtropin has been assessed in a randomised, double-blind, parallel, controlled Phase III study in children with growth hormone deficiency. There were no relevant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences between Valtropin and the reference medicinal product with regard to height velocity and height velocity SDS.

An open single-arm Phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of treatment with Valtropin in girls with short stature associated with Turner syndrome showed a significant effect of study treatment on height velocity.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

A double-blind, randomised, single dose, crossover study in 24 healthy volunteers showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Valtropin was comparable to that of the reference medicinal product. Subcutaneous administration of 0.073 mg/kg body weight of Valtropin resulted in a C max of 43.97 ng/ml and an AUC 0-24 h of 369.90 ng·h/ml. C max was reached at 4 h and t ½ was 3 h.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Water for injections.

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies with Valtropin of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies. Animal studies with Valtropin are not sufficient to assess the reproductive toxicity potential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin medicinal products there is no evidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions for the embryo or foetus. Long-term studies for carcinogenicity have not been performed. There are no specific local tolerance studies in animals after subcutaneous injection of Valtropin. However, in single and repeat-dose general toxicity studies no adverse reactions at the injection sites were reported. 6.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

## Valtropin 5 mg/1.5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection Somatropin

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.

## In this leaflet:

1. What Valtropin is and what it is used for

2. Before you use Valtropin 3. How to use Valtropin 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Valtropin 6. Further information 1. WHAT Valtropin IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Your medicine is called Valtropin. It is a human growth hormone, also called somatropin. It has the same structure as the growth hormone that the body produces in the pituitary glands (glands located at the base of the brain). Growth hormone regulates the growth and development of cells. When it stimulates growth of cells in the long bones of the legs and spine, it causes an increase in height. Valtropin is used -to treat children (2 to 11 years old) and teenagers (12 to 18 years old) who do not develop to their normal height because of poor bone growth caused by growth hormone deficiency (relative lack of growth hormone), Turner syndrome, or 'chronic renal insufficiency' (a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose their ability to perform their normal functions, such as the removal of wastes and extra fluid from the body). -to treat adults with severe growth hormone deficiency who already had growth hormone deficiency when they were children or who do not have enough growth hormone during their adult years for some other reason. In this leaflet the patient is addressed as 'you'. Caregivers administering Valtropin to their children should consider that 'you' refers to the child. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2. BEFORE YOU USE Valtropin

## Do not use Valtropin

- -if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients of the powder or solvent of Valtropin , e.g. metacresol (see section 2, 'Take special care with Valtropin - Occurrence of certain side effects')
- -and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour . Tumours must be inactive and you must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Valtropin.
- -for growth promotion in children who have already stopped growing
- -if you have had a serious heart or abdominal operation
- -if you are being treated for more than one injury following a serious accident
- -if you have sudden serious breathing problems

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Take special care with Valtropin

## Examinations before starting treatment

- -A specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine you to decide if it is safe to use Valtropin.
- -If you have had a brain tumour a specialist doctor trained in hormone disorders must examine your pituitary function to decide if it is safe to use Valtropin.
- -Before children are treated for growth hormone deficiency due to kidney problems, the doctor should observe the child for one year before starting growth hormone treatment.
- -If adults have been treated with growth hormone during childhood, they should be re-evaluated for growth hormone deficiency before starting any further treatment with growth hormones.
- -Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should not be treated with Valtropin unless they are also suffering from growth hormone failure.

## During or after serious illness

- -If you have had a brain tumour, you should be re-examined frequently to make sure that the tumour has not come back.

## Monitoring during treatment by your doctor

-If you had cancer as a child. A higher risk for having a second tumour (benign and malignant) has been reported in patients that survived their cancer and were treated with somatropin. Of these second tumours, in particular, brain tumours were the most common. -If children have had a kidney transplant, growth hormone treatment will be stopped. -If the child has Turner syndrome, the child's doctor should carefully check for ear infections such as otitis media, because Turner syndrome patients have an increased risk of ear or other hearing disorders. Occurrence of certain side effects -If symptoms like headache (severe and recurrent), visual changes, nausea and/or vomiting occur, please ask your doctor for advice. -If you have injected Valtropin by mistake into the muscle instead of under the skin, your blood sugar may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Please contact your doctor for further advice. -If the child begins to limp under treatment with Valtropin, please ask your doctor for advice. -If you are a child and you are treated with somatropin. You have an increased risk of developing an inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) compared to adults treated with somatropin. Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated children who develop abdominal pain. -Too much growth hormone can cause greater than normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (acromegaly), high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and presence of sugar in the urine (glucosuria). Always use Valtropin as recommended by your doctor. -If an allergic reaction to solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with water for injections without preservative (metacresol) and used as a single use vial (see section 5 'How to store Valtropin'). Do not use the supplied solvent if you have a known allergy to metacresol preservative . Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Valtropin may affect the way your body handles sugar from food and drink. Your doctor may check the amount of sugar in your urine or blood.
- -Valtropin can affect the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, so you must have thyroid function tests from time to time. If the thyroid is not working properly, Valtropin may not work as well as it should.

## Using other medicines

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

Tell especially your doctor if you are taking

- -adrenal steroid hormone such as cortisone or prednisolone
- -insulin
- -oral oestrogen
- -sex hormones, medicines to treat stress response or inflammation (corticosteroids), medicines to treat epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepin)or cyclosporine (a medicine to suppress the immune system).

Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Valtropin or of the other medicine.

## Pregnancy

Valtropin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you become pregnant, tell your doctor immediately.

Breast-feeding If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, please ask your doctor for advice before using Valtropin. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicines. Driving and using machines Valtropin has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines. Important information about some of the ingredients of Valtropin The accompanying solvent of Valtropin contains metacresol. Do not use this solvent if you are allergic to metacresol (see section 2, ' Do not use Valtropin'). If an allergic reaction to the solvent occurs, the vials should be reconstituted with water for injections and used as a single use vial (see section 5 'How to store Valtropin'). 3. HOW TO USE Valtropin Always use Valtropin exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Do not inject Valtropin yourself if you are not sure about the dose. Dosage Your doctor will tell you how much to use. This will vary according to your disease. Please do not change the dosage without consulting your doctor. The accuracy of the Valtropin dose should be checked every 6 months by your doctor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In general the dosage will be calculated as described below. However, individual doses may vary, and the doctor may change your dose based on your specific need.

## Children

## Growth hormone deficiency in children

Inject 0.025 - 0.035 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously).

## Children with Turner syndrome

Inject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children before puberty, who suffer from long-term kidney problems Inject 0.045 - 0.050 milligrams (mg) for each kilogramme of body weight once daily under the skin (subcutaneously).

## Adults

## Growth hormone deficiency in adults

Inject 0.15 - 0.30 milligrams (mg) once daily under the skin (subcutaneously). A lower starting dose may be necessary if you are older or overweight.

If necessary, your doctor will gradually increase this dose according to your individual requirements based on the clinical outcome and measurement of your blood levels of a so called 'growth factor' (known as IGF-1). The total daily dose usually does not exceed 1 mg. IGF-1 concentrations need to be regularly measured and should be maintained below the upper limit of the normal range for your age and sex.

Your doctor will always prescribe the minimum effective dose to be used. Dosage adjustment In elderly patients a dose reduction may be necessary. The dosage of somatropin should be reduced in cases of long lasting swelling (oedema) or severe abnormal sensation (paresthesia), in order to avoid the development of a rare side effect called carpal tunnel syndrome (hand numbness and pain). Following use of the medicine for some time, it may be necessary to reduce the dose, particularly in men. When using other medicines the dose of Valtropin or of the other medicine may need to be adjusted (see section 2, 'Using other medicines'). Administration Valtropin is intended for subcutaneous use after reconstitution. This means that after reconstitution of the powder with the solvent provided the solution is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue just under the skin. If you are injecting this medicine yourself you will be instructed how to prepare and give the injection. Do not inject Valtropin yourself unless you have received training. Detailed instructions for subcutaneous administration are provided with this leaflet (see section 'Information on how to self-inject Valtropin' at the end of this leaflet).

## If you use more Valtropin than you should

In case more Valtropin was used than recommended, please consult your doctor.

If you have used too much Valtropin, initially your blood sugar may decrease and become too low (hypoglycaemia) and subsequently increase and become too high (hyperglycaemia). If you have used too much Valtropin over a longer period, this may result in a greater than normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (acromegaly).

## If you forget to use Valtropin

Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten doses. Continue with the prescribed dosage regimen. If you have any doubts, please contact your doctor.

## If you stop using Valtropin

Please ask your doctor for advice before stopping treatment. Interruption or early stopping of treatment with Valtropin may impair the success of the growth hormone therapy.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## Injecting the solution

24. Ensure the solution is at room temperature. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms.
25. Inspect the solution prior to administration: if the solution is discoloured or if you can see any solid particles in the liquid the solution MUST NOT be injected.
26. Select the injection site according to the recommendation of your doctor. It is very important that you vary the injection site each time you give the medicine.
27. Cleanse the injection site with an alcohol swab and wait for the area to dry.
28. Check that the correct dose of Valtropin solution is in the syringe. Hold the syringe in your hand as you would hold a pencil.
29. Squeeze a big skin fold between your thumb and index finger. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at a 45° to 90° angle with a quick, firm motion. This hurts less than pushing the needle in slowly.
30. Slowly (over a few seconds) inject the solution by gently depressing the plunger until the syringe is empty.

31. Withdraw the needle quickly and apply pressure over the injection site with a dry gauze or cotton pad for several seconds. If there is bleeding, cover the injection site with an adhesive plaster. 32. Dispose the used syringe in a closed container. Be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator . When empty, discard the vial as well. For shelf-life after reconstitution see section 5 'How to store Valtropin'.
