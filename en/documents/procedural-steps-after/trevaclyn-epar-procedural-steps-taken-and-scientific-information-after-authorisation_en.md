|         | This type II variation concerns the amendment of section 4.8 of the SmPC in accordance with the QRD template as per the CHMP request included in the Assessment Report on the PSUR 7 for Tredaptive/Trevaclyn/Pelzont. The Patient Leaflet, section 4, was updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in Sweden and Malta in the Package Leaflet. The format of the numbers used to express the strength of Tredaptive/Trevaclyn/Pelzont on blister foil was amended in order to improve clarity.

| WS/0118 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

The PI was amended accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet for the UK and the Netherlands. This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of a Type II variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The MAH conducted a search in the WAES database for spontaneous reports with the MedDRA PTs of blister and dermatitis bullous in patients on therapy with ER niacin/laropiprant from market introduction till November 2010. Thirteen postmarketing reports (1 serious, 12 nonserious) and 1 serious study report were identified. This resulted in an update of the SmPC and the term \"vesiculobullous rash\" has been added in section 4.8. This is also reflected in the Package Leaflet under the term \"blistering rash\". The benefit-risk ratio of the medicinal products remains favourable. authorised |

| WS/0060 | application for a variation following a procedure according to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. related to significant modifications particular to new quality, pre- pharmacovigilance data 18/11/2010 20/12/2010 Medicinal product no longer | Annex This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.8 of the SPC to include the ADR 'anaphylactic shock' based on post-marketing experience in patients on therapy with ER niacin/laropiprant. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the SPC and Package Leaflet in line with the latest QRD templates (version 7.3.1) and the latest SPC guideline, and to make minor editorial changes in the annexes as well as to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet for Cyprus and Malta. This application was submitted for a Type II variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Anaphylactic shock: Section 4.8 of the SPC currently includes 'angioedema' and 'Type I hypersensitivity'. However, the most severe expression of anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, has so far not been identified in the current product information. A review of one post- marketing report of anaphylactic shock cannot exclude the possibility of a causal association. As a result, the term \"anaphylactic shock\" has been added in section 4.8 as an adverse experience reported in post-marketing use. The MAH will continue to monitor reports of anaphylactic shock authorised |

The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. This effect is unlikely to be clinically important as laropiprant did not increase bleeding time when coadministered with clopidogrel throughout the dosing interval. |
