## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

4.1 Therapeutic indications Pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, post pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer). Enzepi is indicated in infants, children, adolescents and adults. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The dosage of Enzepi should be individualised based on clinical symptoms, the degree of steatorrhoea present, the fat content of the diet, or actual body weight. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose and gradually increased under medical supervision with careful monitoring of the patient's response and symptoms. Patients should be instructed not to increase the dosage on their own. Changes in dosage may require an adjustment period of several days. Maximum recommended dose The maximum recommended total dose is 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day), or 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day. Higher doses should be used with caution if warranted (see sections 4.4 and 4.9) and only if they are documented to be effective by 3day faecal fat measurements that indicate a significantly improved coefficient of fat absorption. For each snack, half of the prescribed Enzepi dose for a full meal should be given. Enzyme doses expressed as lipase units/kg of body weight per meal must be reduced in older patients because they tend to ingest less fat per kilogram of body weight. It is important to ensure adequate hydration of patients at all times whilst dosing Enzepi. Inadequate hydration may predispose to/or aggravate constipation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Starting dose

## Paediatric population below 1 year of age

For infants below 1 year of age the recommended starting dose is 5,000 lipase units per meal (generally 120 ml of milk) (see section Method of administration).

## Paediatric population between 1 and less than 4 years of age

For children between 1 and less than 4 years of age the recommended starting dose is 1,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal.

## Paediatric population aged 4 years or older and adults (including elderly)

For children aged 4 years or older , adolescents and adults the recommended starting dose is 500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

## For oral use.

Enzepi should be taken during meals or snacks, with a drink of water or juice.

Capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed. Crushing, chewing, or mixing capsule contents with food or fluid with a pH greater than 5 or storing the food mixture (see below), can lead to a disruption of the protective gastro-resistant coating. This can result in early release of the enzymes in the oral cavity, irritation of the mucous membranes and may lead to loss of enzyme activity.

## Patients unable to swallow capsules whole

For patients who are unable to swallow capsules whole, the capsules may be carefully opened and the contents mixed (without crushing) with small amounts of acidic soft food of pH 5 or less (e.g., fruit puree [apple/ pear], yoghurt, juice [orange/pineapple/apple]). Do not mix with water, milk, breast-milk, formula, flavoured milk or hot food. The Enzepi soft food mixture should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion. Care should be taken to ensure that Enzepi is not retained in the mouth. The mixture must not be stored.

Paediatric population For paediatric patients below 1 year of age, Enzepi must be administered immediately prior to each feed. The capsule should be carefully opened to empty the content (granules). The granules may be administered with a small amount of appropriate acidic food or directly into the mouth. Administration should be followed by breast-milk or formula to ensure complete ingestion. The contents of the capsule should not be mixed directly into formula or breast-milk as this may diminish efficacy. Care should be taken to ensure that Enzepi is not crushed or chewed or retained in the mouth, to avoid irritation of the oral mucosa. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Fibrosing colonopathy Strictures of the ileo-caecum and large bowel (fibrosing colonopathy) have been reported in patients with cystic fibrosis taking high doses of pancreatin preparations. As a precaution, unusual abdominal symptoms or changes in abdominal symptoms should be medically assessed to exclude the possibility of fibrosing colonopathy, especially if the patient is taking in excess of 10,000  lipase units/kg/day. Anaphylactic reactions Rarely, anaphylactic reactions have been reported with pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of the same active ingredient (pancreas powder). If this reaction occurs, patients should be advised to discontinue treatment immediately and seek urgent medical assistance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Potential for hyperuricaemia

Caution must be exercised when prescribing Enzepi to patients with a history of gout, renal impairment, or hyperuricaemia. Porcine derived pancreatic enzyme products contain purines that may increase blood uric acid levels.

## Potential for irritation to oral mucosa

Care should be taken to ensure that no medicinal product is retained in the mouth. Enzepi should not be crushed or chewed or mixed in foods having a pH greater than 5. These actions can disrupt the protective gastro-resistant coating resulting in early release of enzymes, irritation of oral mucosa, and/or loss of enzyme activity (see section 4.2).

## Abnormal blood glucose levels

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consideration should be given to blood glucose monitoring in patients at risk of abnormal blood glucose levels as glycaemic control may be affected by administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (see section 4.8).

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially `sodium-free´.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Pancreatic enzyme medicinal products do not cause pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions based on their pharmacology, as they are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. No clinically relevant interactions are expected.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. It is also not known whether this medicinal product can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Although, no preclinical investigations were carried out with Enzepi there is no evidence for any absorption of this medicinal product. Therefore, no reproductive or developmental toxicity is to be expected. The risk and benefit of this medicinal product should be considered in the context of the need to provide adequate nutritional support to a pregnant woman with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Adequate caloric intake during pregnancy is important for normal maternal weight gain and foetal growth. Reduced maternal weight gain and malnutrition can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether this medicinal product is excreted in human milk. Nevertheless, undersirable effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are not anticipated since systemic exposure in breast-feeding women to the pancreatic enzymes present in Enzepi is not expected. As a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from Enzepi therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of continued Enzepi therapy for the breastfeeding woman. Fertility No human data on the effect of Enzepi on fertility are available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Enzepi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most important serious adverse reactions observed with pancreatic enzyme medicinal products  are anaphylactic reactions (see section 4.4) and fibrosing colonopathy (see section 4.4).

The most common adverse reactions reported with Enzepi were gastrointestinal complaints [abdominal pain (16%); flatulence (12%); abdominal distention (7%); diarrhoea and vomiting (6%); constipation (5%); nausea (3%)], and headache occurring in approximately 6% of patients. In clinical trials, most of them were mild to moderate in severity.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

**Class effects

## Description of selected adverse reactions

In patients at risk of abnormal blood glucose levels glycaemic control may be affected by administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (see section 4.4). Cases of blood glucose fluctuations have been reported with Enzepi, most of them non-serious and recovered after diabetic treatment adjustment.

The most relevant class effects of the pancreatic enzyme products include fibrosing colonopathy, hyperuricaemia/ hyperuricosuria and anaphylactic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

In clinical trials, 110 children with CF (cystic fibrosis) aged 1 month and older received Enzepi at a dose that ensured stabilization of symptoms. The safety profile of Enzepi in the paediatric population was similar to that observed in adults.

## Elderly people

No specific adverse reactions were identified in the elderly population. Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions were similar in elderly people with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as compared to adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9 Overdose Chronic high doses of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and as a result in some cases colonic strictures (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). High doses of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with hyperuricosuria and hyperuricaemia, and should be used with caution in patients with a history of gout, renal impairment or hyperuricaemia (see section 4.4). Supportive measures including stopping pancreatic enzyme therapy and ensuring adequate rehydration are recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Digestives, incl. enzymes, Enzyme preparations,  ATC code: A09AA02 Mechanism of action Enzepi belongs to the family of pancreatic enzyme products and contains a defined amount of lipase, amylase and protease that have been extracted from porcine pancreas and purified using a process designed to inactivate viruses. Gastro-resistant granules are thoroughly mixed with chyme when the capsule dissolves in the stomach, without inactivating the acid-sensitive enzymes. It is only in the duodenum, which has a different environment with a pH value greater than 5, that these digestive enzymes are released from the granules. Then, enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglycerides, glycerol, and free fatty acids, protein into peptides and amino acids, and starch into dextrins and short chain sugars such as maltose and maltotriose in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Enzepi has been evaluated in one active-comparator study and one placebo-controlled study conducted in 130 patients with EPI (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) associated with CF. Moreover three supportive studies were conducted in 34 paediatric patients.

Data generated in the CF population with EPI can be extrapolated to the other causes of EPI such as chronic pancreatitis, post pancreatectomy or pancreatic cancer.

## Study PR-005

The pivotal study PR-005 was conducted in Europe. It was a randomized, double-blind, active controlled, two-treatment, crossover study, comparing Enzepi to standard pancreatic enzyme treatment during 2 treatments periods. During the first treatment period, patients received either Enzepi or the comparator for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

28 days, followed by a cross-over to the alternate treatment for a second 28 day period. For both treatment periods, patients received a dose as close as possible to their stabilized existing pancreatic enzyme product dose on the first day. Then, starting on the second day, the dose of assigned treatment could be changed (titrated up and/or titrated down) to stabilize the symptoms of EPI. Stabilization of the symptoms had to be obtained before the end of the first 14 days of each treatment period.

A total of 96 patients, aged 12 to 43 years, were randomized in the intent-to-treat population. During the study, patients were instructed to consume 100 g (± 15 g) of fat per day and to maintain a consistent dietary fat intake for meals and snacks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the coefficient of fat absorption over 72 hours (CFA-72h) which was calculated at the end of each treatment period, from the stools collected during the last 3 days of each treatment period. The collection was performed in an approved, controlled environment that enabled supervised dietary intake and quantitative stool collection.

Subjects achieved a mean CFA-72h of 84.08 with Enzepi and of 85.33 with comparator. The difference in means was -1.25 (95% CI, -3.62 to 1.12), with p=0.2972. Thus, Enzepi demonstrated both non-inferiority and equivalence to the comparator in fat absorption control (measured as CFA-72h) in adolescents and adults with CF-associated EPI.

## Study EUR-1008-M

The supportive EUR-1008-M, conducted in the US, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 34 patients, ages 7 to 23 years, with EPI due to CF. Patients were randomized to receive Enzepi or matching placebo for 6 to 7 days of treatment, followed by cross-over to the alternate treatment for an additional 6 to 7 days. All patients consumed a high-fat diet (greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per day) during the treatment period.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA-72h) between Enzepi and placebo treatment. The CFA-72h was determined by a 72-hour stool collection during both treatments, when both fat excretion and fat ingestion were measured. Each patient's CFA-72h during placebo treatment was used as their no-treatment CFA-72h value.

Mean CFA-72h was 88% with Enzepi treatment compared to 63% with placebo treatment. The mean difference in CFA-72h was 26 percentage points greater with Enzepi treatment with a 95% Confidence Interval of (19, 32) and p&lt;0.001.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The short-term efficacy and safety of Enzepi were assessed in clinical studies in paediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 years, with EPI due to CF.

## Study  EUR-1008-M

EUR-1008-M was conducted in 34 patients with EPI due to CF, 26 of whom were children, including 8 children aged 7 to 11 years, and 18 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Results are presented above. The safety and efficacy in the paediatric patients in this study was similar to the adult patients .

## Study EUR 1009-M

EUR 1009-M was an open-label, single arm study in 19 patients, ages 1 to 6 years, with EPI due to CF. Approximately half of the patients were ages 1 to 3 years. Patients were transitioned to Enzepi from their usual PEP (pancreatic enzyme product) treatment. After a 4-14 days screening period on their usual PEP, patients received Enzepi at individually titrated doses ranging between 2,300 and 10,000 lipase units per kg body weight per day, with a mean of approximately 5,000 lipase units per kg body weight per day (not to exceed 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal) for 14 days. There was no wash-out period.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of 'responders', defined as those patients without steatorrhoea (&lt;30% faecal fat content) and without signs and symptoms of malabsorption after one and two weeks of treatment with Enzepi. Steatorrhoea was assessed from the faecal fat content measured by spot faecal fat testing on Days 11 and 18 compared with baseline (under usual PEPs).

The number of responders (patients with less than 30% faecal fat content and without signs and symptoms of malabsorption) at baseline was 10/19 (52.6%), 13/19 (68.4%) after 1 week of treatment (stabilization) and 11/19 (57.9%) after the second week of open-label treatment with Enzepi. The mean faecal fat content was similar at baseline (24.8%), after stabilization (27.0%) and after the second week of open-label treatment (27.3%).

## Study PR-011

Study PR-011 was an open-label crossover study in 15 patients, ages 1 to 11 months, with EPI due to CF. Patients were randomized to receive Enzepi from an opened capsule mixed and administered with apple juice (in a syringe nurser) or apple sauce (using a spoon) for 10 days of treatment, followed by a cross-over to the alternate mode of administration  for an additional 10 days.

The primary objective was to assess the acceptability of 2 modes of administration using an acceptability questionnaire that was completed by the caregiver. Twelve patients completed both assigned treatment arms and were evaluated. Overall, caregivers were satisfied with using apple sauce as a dosing method compared with apple juice.

## Study PR-018

Study PR-018 was a 12-month open-label extension of Study PR-011. Patients were administered Enzepi at the same dose they were taking at the end of Study PR-011. The dose of Enzepi was adjusted during the 12month study as the patient's grew and gained weight.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Twelve patients completed the study. Overall, an improvement was observed from baseline to study completion for growth indices including weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length percentiles.

## Elderly people

Clinical studies of Enzepi did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond different from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pancreatic enzymes in Enzepi are gastro-resistant to minimise destruction or inactivation in gastric acid. Enzepi is designed to release most of the enzymes in vivo at pH greater than 5.5. Pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No preclinical investigations were carried out with Enzepi. However as pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, no systemic toxicity is expected following oral administration of pancreas powder.

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Enzepi is and what it is used for Enzepi is a pancreatic enzyme replacement medicine for people whose bodies do not make enough of enzymes to digest food. Enzepi contains a mixture of  natural digestive enzymes which are used to digest food. These include lipases for digesting fat, proteases for digesting protein and amylases for digestions carbohydrates. The enzymes are taken from pig pancreas glands. Enzepi is for use by adults, adolescents, children and infants with 'exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', a condition that makes the body less able to break down and digest food. 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If your doctor advises you to increase the number of capsules you take each day, you should do so slowly over several days. If you still have fatty stools (smelly, loose, oily, pale stools) or other stomach or gut problems (gastrointestinal symptoms), talk to your doctor as your dose may need to be adjusted again.

Do not take more capsules in a day than the amount your doctor has told you (total daily dose). Depending on what strength of Enzepi you take, your doctor will tell you how many capsules you need to take with each meal or snack.

Your total daily dose should not exceed 2,500 lipase units per kg of body weight per meal (or 10,000 lipase units per kg of body weight per day).

## How to take Enzepi

## Children (over 1 year of age), adolescents and adults

Enzepi should always be taken with a meal or snack. The capsules should be swallowed whole and take them with a drink of water or juice. If you or your child eat a lot of meals or snacks in a day, be careful not to go over your total daily dose of Enzepi. If you or your child have trouble swallowing Enzepi capsules, open carefully the capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) on a small amount of acidic food such as fruit puree (apple/ pear), yoghurt, or juice (orange/pineapple/apple). Do not mix the Enzepi granules with water, milk, breast-milk, formula feeds, flavoured milk or hot food. Ask your doctor about other foods you can sprinkle Enzepi granules on. If you sprinkle the Enzepi granules on food, swallow the mixture or give it to your child straight after you have mixed it, followed by a drink of water or juice. Make sure the medicine and food mixture is swallowed completely and that no granules are left in your or your child's mouth. Do not store Enzepi that has been sprinkled on food. Enzepi capsules or the granules inside them should not be crushed or chewed and the capsules or the granules inside them should not be held in your or your child's mouth. Crushing, chewing or holding the Enzepi capsules in your or your child's mouth may cause irritation in your or your child's mouth or change the way Enzepi works in your or your child's body. Infants (below 1 year of age) For infants below 1 year of age, give Enzepi just before each feed of formula or breast-milk. Do not sprinkle the capsule contents directly into the formula or breast-milk. Carefully open the capsule and empty the granules on a small amount of acidic food (see above). If you sprinkle the Enzepi granules on food, give the medicine and food mixture to your child right away and do not store Enzepi that is sprinkled on food. Your child should take all the food mixture and should then drink enough liquid straight after to wash down all the medicine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

You may also sprinkle the granules directly into your child's mouth. Immediately give them milk, formula or breast-milk to drink to ensure the granules are completely swallowed and none remain in your child's mouth.

Look into your child's mouth to make sure that all the medicine has been swallowed.

## If you take more Enzepi than you should

If you take more Enzepi than you should drink plenty of water and talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

## If you forget to take Enzepi

Do not take a double dose or extra capsules to make up for a forgotten dose. Wait until your next meal, and take your usual number of capsules with your meal.

## If you stop taking Enzepi

Keep taking your medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. Many patients will need to take pancreatic enzyme replacement medicines for the rest of their life.
