## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for perampanel, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on hallucinations from spontaneous reports, clinical trials and literature, including 20  cases  possibly  related  and  5  cases  probably  related  to  perampanel  (including  2  cases  in  which hallucinations  occurred  from  15  to  60  min  following  perampanel  intake),  with  a  compatible  temporal relationship and mainly with a positive dechallenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between perampanel and hallucinations is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing perampanel should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for perampanel the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing perampanel is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
