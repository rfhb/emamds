From the 75 cases reported 12 were considered serious and 3 were identified as possibly related to treatment with ticagrelor. These events included angioedema as adverse hypersensitivity event and were all retrieved from post-marketing experience. Based on these results the CHMP supported the inclusion of 'hypersensitivity including angioedema' under frequency 'uncommon' in section |
