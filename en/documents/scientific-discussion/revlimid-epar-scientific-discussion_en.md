## 1.1 Introduction

Multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy of the plasma cell and represents the second most common haematological malignancy (about 10%), with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being the most common. It is estimated that approximately 21,500 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed per annum with approximately 16,000 deaths from the disease annually within the EU (EUCAN database, 1998).

Multiple myeloma is characterised by an asymptomatic or subclinical phase before diagnosis (possibly for  several  years),  a  chronic  phase  lasting  several  years  and  an  aggressive  terminal  phase.  Multiple myeloma is primarily a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years (Sirohi and Powles, 2004). Multiple myeloma leads to progressive morbidity and eventual mortality by lowering resistance  to  infection  and  causing  significant  skeletal  destruction  (with  bone  pain,  pathological fractures, and  hypercalcaemia  [Kyle  and  Rajkumar,  2004]),  anaemia,  renal  failure, and, less commonly, neurological complications and hyperviscosity. From the time of diagnosis, the survival without treatment is between  6 to 12 months  and  extends to 3 years with  chemotherapy. Approximately 25% of patients survive 5 years or longer, with fewer than 5% surviving longer than 10 years.

At the time of diagnosis, multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease, with a course that varies on the basis of both disease- and host-related factors (e.g., age, renal function, stage, alpha 2-microglobulin, chromosomal abnormalities). Most patients with myeloma receive multiple treatments over the course of their disease, and the precise sequence of therapy and regimens used can be quite variable.

Though  the  treatment  for  multiple  myeloma  has  changed  dramatically  within  the  last  decade,  the disease remains incurable. Approved anticancer agents for the treatment of myeloma in the US include melphalan  (1992),  carmustine  (BCNU,  1977)  and  cyclophosphamide  (1959)  and  in  addition,  in Europe, epirubicin is also approved for treatment of this disease.

Spontaneous remissions do not occur in multiple myeloma and no placebo effect on response has been noted. Standard therapy for myeloma currently has consisted of 4 classes of agents: corticosteroids, alkylating  agents,  anthracyclines,  and  investigational  agents.  A  fifth  treatment  class  available  to patients under the age of 65 years is high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.

Currently, a medicinal product containing bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor has been approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has relapsed after at least one  prior  treatment  and  who  have  already  undergone  or  are  unsuitable  for  transplantation.  In  an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, non-randomised study of 202 patients, the overall response rate to bortezomib was 35% (67/193), with the response lasting for a median time of 12 months (Richardson et al , 2003). One randomised study included 669 with relapsed/refractory myeloma patients to receive either  an  intravenous  bolus  of  bortezomib  or  pulsed  high-dose  dexamethasone.  Time-to-disease progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the bortezomib group compared to the dexamethasone group (189 vs. 109 days) (Richardson et al , 2005). A significantly higher incidence of serious adverse events was observed with bortezomib in comparison to dexamethasone (Dispenzieri et al , 2005).

Resistance to conventional treatments is a major problem resulting in relapse and in order to overcome treatment resistance, novel approaches are required to target the mechanisms by which myeloma cells proliferate and survive in the bone marrow (Richardson et al , 2002).

Lenalidomide is one of a number of novel compounds based on the molecular structure of thalidomide that  have  been  developed  with  a  view  to  improving  the  immunomodulatory  effect  of  the  parent compound whilst also providing a better safety profile (Bartlett et al , 2004, Richardson et al , 2002).

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Celgene Europe Ltd. has applied for a marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for the medicinal product Revlimid 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg hard capsules, containing respectively 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg of the new chemical entity lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulating agent.

## 1.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Revlimid has been developed as hard capsules in 4 dosage strengths of 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg. Revlimid capsules are supplied in PVC/ACLAR (PCTFE) blisters with push through aluminium foil.

## Active Substance

- Manufacture

Lenalidomide (3-(4' aminoisoindoline-1'-one)-1-piperidine-2, 6-dione) is a new chemical entity.

<!-- image -->

It is a synthetic derivative of glutamic acid and is structurally close to thalidomide (identical backbone but differs from thalidomide by removing an oxygen from the phthalyl ring and by adding an amine group). Although it is chiral and possesses an asymmetric carbon, it has been developed as a racemic mixture since it undergoes  racemisation under physiological conditions. It is obtained as a hemihydrate form and is non-hygroscopic.

Lenalidomide exhibits the phenomenon of polymorphism but the commercial process leads only to the desired polymorph.

Lenalidomide synthetic process consists of 4 steps starting from alpha-aminoglutarimide hydrochloride and methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate. The process can be summarised as follow: coupling step, reduction step (crude lenalidomide), recrystallisation (pre-micronised lenalidomide) and micronisation.

The route of synthesis has been sufficiently described including the comprehensive description of the micronisation step.

Appropriate  specifications  have  been  provided  for  the  intermediates,  starting  materials,  reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials. However, minor points will be addressed further through follow-up measures.

Adequate  in-process  controls  for  critical  steps  and  intermediates  have  been  applied  during  the synthesis  of  lenalidomide.  In  addition,  validation  of  the  process  has  been  performed  for  the lenalidomide synthesis and will be completed in follow-up measures. Analytical methods have been sufficiently described and validated.

The  structure  of  lenalidomide  has  been  fully  elucidated  using  usual  methods  such  as  elemental analysis, IR (infra-red), UV (ultra-violet), mass spectrometry, 1 H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), 13 C-NMR  spectroscopy,  X-ray,  optical  rotation,  DSC  (differential  scanning  calorimetry),  TGA (thermal  gravimetric  analysis),  and  particle  size  analysis.  Analyses  were  especially  focused  on  the polymorphism of the molecule as well as the particle size.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Potential impurities, degradation products and residual solvents which may be found in lenalidomide have been extensively discussed. Impurities remain below the ICH qualification limits (guideline ICH Q3A).

Batch analysis data of 20 lots of lenalidomide are within the specification. The level of impurities and residual solvents remain very low and do not exceed ICH qualification thresholds.

## · Specification

Since  lenalidomide  is  not  described  in  any  pharmacopoeia,  an  in-house  monograph  has  been presented.  Specifications  for  lenalidomide  (hemihydrate)  include  parameters  such  as  appearance, identification (IR and X-ray diffraction), assay (HPLC), related impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl-Fischer), heavy metals, sulphated ash and particle size (laser diffraction).

Specification  is  appropriately  described  and  justified  for  residual  solvents  and  particle  size  limits. Limits retained are in line with the ICH guidelines.

Analytical methods have satisfactorily described and validated.

Lenalidomide is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, placed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drums. The packaging materials comply with relevant EC directives and Ph Eur. monographs.

## · Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  3  pilot  batches  of  lenalidomide  stored  in  the  commercial packaging under ICH conditions (up to 24 months at 25°C/60% RH and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH). Tested  parameters  tested  included:  visual  appearance,  assay,  related  impurities,  X-ray  powder diffraction and water content.

All results remain well within the retained specification under long-term and accelerated conditions. Moreover, photostability stability testing indicated that lenalidomide is not light sensitive.

Based on the available data, a retest period of 2 years was granted providing that the active substance is kept in the commercial packaging and not above 25°C. The applicant has committed to continue the studies.

## Medicinal Product

- Pharmaceutical Development

Active Substance: The pharmaceutical development has taken into consideration the main aspects of the active substance: particle size and polymorphic form.

Formulation Development: A hard capsule dosage form was chosen due to its favourable performance in manufacturing studies and analytical testing. Revlimid capsules, 5 and 10 mg, are dose proportional and use a common blend whereas the 15 and 25 mg are slightly different for the ingredients ratio. Formulation development is sufficiently detailed. Micronisation has been performed to ensure blend and  content  uniformity  of  the  active  substance  present  at  a  low  level  in  the  medicinal  product formulation.

Overages: No overage is included in the formulation for Revlimid capsules 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg.

Physicochemical and Biological Properties: The impact of physicochemical properties (particle size and  polymorphic  form)  of  lenalidomide  that  could  theoretically  affect  the  performance  of  the medicinal product has been studied. It can be concluded that neither the particle size (when included in the  distribution  range  of  micronised  particles),  neither  does  the  polymorphic  form  affect  the dissolution of the capsules.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Manufacturing  Process  Development:  The  manufacturing  process  is  a  simple  blending  and  filling process. The manufacturing development has been adequately described.

Container  closure  system:  Revlimid  capsules,  5,  10,  15  and  25 mg  are  packaged  in  blisters (PVC/ACLAR)  with  push-through  foil.  Suitability  of  the  material  is  demonstrated  by  the  stability data.

Excipients: The excipients selected for the lenalidomide capsules formulation are those typically used in  capsule  formulations.  They  are  all  described  in  Ph. Eur.  and  comply  with  the  corresponding monographs,  and  include  anhydrous  lactose  (as  diluent),  microcrystalline  cellulose  (as  diluent), croscarmellose sodium (as disintegrant) and magnesium stearate (as lubricant).

Regarding the capsule shells, adequate manufacturer's specification includes testing for appearance, colour, loss on drying, disintegration time, identity of gelatin, microbiological tests as per Ph Eur. and physical dimensions. The components of the printing inks are in compliance with Ph Eur. or USP/NF. In  addition,  the  hard  capsule  colorants  comply  with  the  relevant  EC  Directives  on  colorants  in foodstuffs.

Compatibility between the active substance and the excipients has been suitably demonstrated.

## · Adventitious Agents

Among the excipients used in the formulation, only lactose (ingredient of the formulation) and gelatin (component of the capsule shell) are from animal origin. However, lactose is sourced from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption (EMEA 410/01 rev 1) and TSE declaration is provided in 3.2.R. TSE certificates from the gelatin suppliers are provided.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is simple and consists of dry blending of the ingredients and filling the capsules.  The  process  is  considered  standard  as  per  the  guideline  CHMP/QWP/848/99.  It  has  been adequately described including the equipment and the operating parameters. Appropriate in-process controls of the critical steps and intermediates have been set, such as control of the fill weight of the capsules.

Validation of the manufacturing process has been carried out satisfactorily at both manufacturing sites. However minor points will be resolved through follow-up measures.

## · Product Specification

The proposed specifications at release and at the end of shelf life for Revlimid 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg capsules include appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), assay of the active substance (HPLC), related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph Eur.  2.9.40)  and microbial contamination (Ph Eur. 5.1.4 category 3A). Specification has been correctly justified.

Non-compendial analytical methods have been described and validated in accordance with ICH requirements.

Batch analyses data confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process. All the results comply with the retained specifications.

Container  closure  system:  Revlimid  capsules,  5,  10,  15  and  25 mg,  are  packaged  in  blisters (PVC/ACLAR) with push-through foil. The packaging material has been adequately characterised and complies with Ph Eur. 3.1.11.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  4  batches  (pilot  and  commercial-scale)  of  each  strength (5, 10, 15 and 25 mg) kept in the commercial packaging under ICH conditions (up to 24 months at 25°C/60%  and  6  months  at  40°C/75%  RH).  Tested  parameters  include  appearance,  assay,  related impurities and dissolution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  the  results  remain  within  the  specification.  Even  under  accelerated  conditions  the  medicinal product  is  stable  and  no  significant  trend  is  observed  except  for  a  few  out  of  specification  results at 40°C/75%.  A  photostability  study  has  showed  that  the  finished  medicinal  product  is  not  light sensitive.

The applicant has committed to continue the stability studies.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Generally, satisfactory documentation has been provided. The active substance is well characterised and the retained specification including the impurities levels. Lenalidomide is stable and stability data support  the  proposed  re-test  period  providing  that  the  active  substance  is  kept  in  the  commercial packaging and not above 25°C.

Regarding  the  finished  medicinal  product,  the  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process.  It  is adequately described and controlled. It should ensure a consistent quality for the medicinal product. Appropriate  specification  has  been  selected  for  these  hard-capsules.  Stability  studies  under  ICH conditions  have  demonstrated  the  good  stability  of  the  finished  medicinal  product.  Stability  data support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  as  defined  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics (SPC). At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some outstanding quality issues with no impact on the benefit/risk. The applicant undertook to provide with the necessary information as follow-up measures within an agreed timeframe and to submit variations if required following the evaluation of this additional information.

## 1.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Pivotal  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  rats,  monkey  and  rabbits  (embryo-foetal  toxicity). Studies on pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics and toxicology were performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).

## Pharmacology

The pharmacological properties of lenalidomide were characterised in non-GLP in vitro and in vivo studies focussing on effects on erythropoiesis, haematopoietic tumours, angiogenesis, T-cell proliferation, cytokine stimulation, and NK activity.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Based on in vitro and in vivo tests, lenalidomide has been shown to:

- inhibit secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα ,  IL-1 β ,  IL-6 and IL-12 and increases the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10 by monocytes
- induce T-cell proliferation and IL-2 and IFNγ production, and enhances NK cell activation
- inhibit the proliferation of various haematopoietic tumour cell lines, particularly the multiple myeloma
- enhance foetal haemoglobin expression upon CD34+ erythroid stem cell differentiation
- inhibit the growth of haematopoietic tumour cells and, by inhibiting angiogenesis, reduce the growth of solid tumours in vivo .
- inhibit processes of angiogenesis including endothelial cell migration and tube formation

The molecular target of lenalidomide is not known.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology

The complete core battery of safety pharmacology tests, following ICH guidance, was performed, to determine neuro-behavioural, cardiovascular and respiratory  effects.  The effects  of  lenalidomide  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

general  activity  and  behaviour  were  evaluated in  vivo ,  in  the  rat  model  system.  The  potential  for cardiovascular effects was evaluated in vivo (beagle dogs) and in vitro (HEK-293 cell line), while in vivo respiratory  function  was  assessed  in  anaesthetised  beagle  dogs.  No  relevant  effects  were observed.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Several in  vitro pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  performed,  regarding  the  total  effect  on foetal  haemoglobin,  inhibition  of  rolipam-induced  PDE4A4  foci,  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation, potentiation  of  NK  activity  and  anti-tumour  activity.  Tested  drugs  were  hydroxyurea,  vincristine, rapamycin,  paclitaxel,  carboplatin,  gemcitabine,  cisplatin,  and  rituximab.  Synergistic  effects  were observed  with  rapamycin  in  inhibition  of  cell  growth  and  survival,  with  hydroxyurea  in  effects  on foetal  haemoglobin.  One in  vivo study  was  also  performed  in  severe  combined  immunodeficiency mice where concurrent administration of lenalidomide and rituximab was more effective in controlling lymphoma growth and prolonging survival than rituximab therapy alone.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  lenalidomide  has  been  investigated  in in  vitro and in  vivo studies.  The significant findings of these studies are briefly presented below:

- The S and R enantiomers of lenalidomide are stable to racemisation during storage at -70 o C in buffered (acidic or neutral pH) plasma from rat, monkey and man. The enantiomers undergo significant non-enzymatic racemisation in plasma at 37 0 C at neutral or alkaline pH
- Absolute oral bioavailability of lenalidomide is 68 %, 88 % and 50 % in rat, dog and monkey respectively
- The volume of distribution observed in all species tested indicated an extensive distribution into tissues
- The plasma protein binding is low in all species including humans (19% to 29%)
- The highest concentration of radioactivity following oral administration of [ 14 C]-lenalidomide to rat was in the kidney. Distribution to the brain was extremely low. Distribution to the foetus was limited after oral administration to pregnant rats
- Lenalidomide is metabolically stable in vitro , metabolism related to hydrolysis is seen in vivo
- The  elimination  half-life  in  rats  and  monkeys  was  approximately  2 hours  and  13 hours, respectively, after a single oral administration
- Lenalidomide does not inhibit any of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in vitro
- Lenalidomide  excretion  occurs  mainly  via  the  urine.  The  major  component  in  the  urine  in humans, rats and monkeys is the parent compound

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

Acute  dose  (40  and  2000 mg/kg)  toxicology  studies  in  mice  and  rats  via  intravenous  and  oral administration respectively, were conducted. No mortality was observed at either dose.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The  potential  toxicity  of  lenalidomide  was  assessed  after  repeated  administration  to  rats  (up  to 26 weeks duration) and monkeys (up to 52 weeks duration).

Repeated oral  administration  of  75,  150  and  300 mg/kg/day  to  rats  for  up  to  26  weeks  produced  a reversible  treatment-related  increase  in  kidney  pelvis  mineralisation  in  all  3  doses,  most  notably  in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be less than 75 mg/kg/day, and is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on AUC exposure.

Repeated oral administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks produced mortality and  significant  toxicity  (marked  weight  loss,  reduced  red  and  white  blood  cell  and  platelet  counts, multiple organ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid organs and bone marrow

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

atrophy). Repeated oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year produced reversible  changes  in  bone  marrow  cellularity,  a  slight  decrease  in  myeloid:erythroid  cell  ratio  and thymic atrophy. The NOAEL is less than 1 mg/kg. Mild suppression of white blood cell count was observed  at  1 mg/kg/day  corresponding  to  approximately  the  same  human  dose  based  on  AUC comparison.

## · Genotoxicity

An extensive battery of genotoxic studies was conducted, including the ICH guidelines for testing of genotoxic potential (a bacterial mutation test, a mouse lymphoma assay, a cultured human peripheral blood lymphocyte test, a Syrian hamster embryo transformation assay, and an in vivo rat micronucleus tests. There were no indications of genotoxicity in any of these assays. However, genotoxicity assays were performed without knowing the level of two impurities, namely RC3 and RC4. This aspect will be investigated in the post-authorisation phase (follow-up measure).

## · Carcinogenicity

No studies on carcinogenicity have been performed which is acceptable for the proposed indication.

## · Reproduction toxicity

A  complete  battery  of  ICH  recommended  reproductive/developmental  toxicology  studies  was conducted, including studies to assess the potential adverse effects on male and female fertility and reproduction, embryo-foetal development (embryo-foetal toxicity/teratogenicity) and maternal reproductive performance and peri- and post-natal development of the offspring.

Doses  of  lenalidomide  as  high  as  500 mg/kg/day  did  not  selectively  affect  male  or  female  rat reproductive performance or embryonic viability during early embryogenesis.

In  the  developmental  toxicity  study  in  the  rats,  the  maternal  and  developmental  NOAEL  were 300 mg/kg/day, with threshold maternal and developmental toxicity at 500 mg/kg/day. Foetal viability was unaffected and there were no embryo-foetal alterations attributable to lenalidomide.

In  rabbits,  administered  3,  10  and  20 mg/kg/day  orally  corresponding  to  up  to  6  times  the  human exposure, no limb abnormalities were attributable to lenalidomide. Developmental toxicity at the 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dose levels was characterised by slightly reduced foetal body weights, increased incidences  of  post  implantation  loss  (early  and  late  resorptions  and  intrauterine  deaths),  and  gross external findings in the foetuses associated with morbidity and pharmacotoxic effects of lenalidomide (purple discoloration of the skin on the entire body). An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 20 mg/kg/day. Although it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct effect. The human relevance of these effects is not known. Soft tissue and skeletal variations in the foetuses  were  also  observed  at  10  and  20 mg/kg/day.  These  included  minor  variations  in  skull ossification  (irregular  nasal-frontal  suture)  and  small  delays  in  ossification  of  the  metacarpals, associated with the reduced foetal body weights. In rabbits, the maternal and developmental NOAEL for lenalidomide were 3 mg/kg/day corresponding to a safety margin of 1.3 considering a 25 mg/day therapeutic dose.

In  some  of  the  rabbit  of  studies,  thalidomide  was  included  as  a  positive  control  for  teratogenicity. Thalidomide  showed  the  expected  teratogenicity  and  the  NOAEL  for  developmental  toxicity  was estimated to be 20 mg/kg in a rabbit strain. While the observed foetal alterations in most cases affected the  limbs,  it  should  be  stressed  that  they  are  distinct  from  the  known  foetal  alterations  occurring  in humans.

The  CHMP requested additional  investigations  to  better  characterise  the  potential  embryotoxic  and teratogenic  effects  of  lenalidomide.  Studies  with  thalidomide  in  monkeys  have  shown  a  relative predictive value in teratogenicity to what has been documented in humans, both in terms of doses and types  of  malformation.  The  toxicological  studies  with  lenalidomide  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  have shown similar toxicity (at similar exposure levels) to what has been documented in patients. Therefore,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cynomolgus  monkeys  appear  to  be  highly  relevant  for  the  evaluation  of  both  pharmacology  and toxicology of lenalidomide. The applicant has committed to perform a study on embryo-foetal toxicity as a post-approval commitment in a sensitive species.

In  the  pre-  and  post-natal  developmental  toxicity  study  of  lenalidomide  in  the  rat,  there  were  no adverse effects on the viability, growth or behaviour of the offspring. The NOAEL for development of the offspring was 500 mg/kg/day.

## · Local tolerance

No local tolerance studies have been performed with lenalidomide.

## · Other toxicity studies

No specific immunotoxicological programme has been performed with lenalidomide.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for lenalidomide has been provided in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

The  predicted  surface  water  concentration  for  lenalidomide  indicates  that  its  use  in  the  proposed indication  should  pose  a  negligible  risk  to  the  environment.  Should  any  lenalidomide  reach  the environment  through  disposal  of  unused  product,  the  environmental  risk  is  likely  to  be  minimal owning  to  the  drug's  low  inherent  toxicity  and  absence  of  bioaccumulation  potential.  As  with  all unused medications, appropriate disposal procedures should be employed.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

Lenalidomide has shown activity in a number of model systems. The pharmacology studies suggest that  the  therapeutic  activities  of  lenalidomide  fall  into  the  following  categories:  anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-erythropoietic. These partly paradoxical findings make impossible to predict the effect of lenalidomide in more complex in vivo models and in human disease. The molecular target of lenalidomide remains unknown for any cell type.  In  vivo,  lenalidomide  was  shown  to  delay  tumour  growth  and  prolong  survival  in  a  mouse xenograft  model  with  human  lymphoma  cells.  Lenalidomide  showed  effect  on  solid  tumour  cell growth in two mouse models. Inhibition of angiogenesis was demonstrated in an in vivo model in the rat. The lack of molecular understanding has several consequences for the assessment of the clinical usefulness. It limits the possibility to predict unwanted pharmacological events, and it makes difficult to evaluate the relevance of different animal species for the safety assessment.

Lenalidomide has been developed based on the structure and pharmacology of thalidomide. In vitro data  suggest  that  lenalidomide  is  much  more  potent.  Lenalidomide  was  10-1000  times  more  potent than thalidomide in various in vitro pharmacology studies of immunomodulatory, anti-proliferative, and pro-erythropoietic activities. However, the data give no evidence for a qualitative difference in pharmacology. This is a key issue, since the broad pharmacology of these compounds is most likely the  basis  for  the  safety  issues  which  have  arisen.  This  is  particularly  true  for  the  probably  most important  safety  concern,  namely  the  teratogenicity  of  thalidomide.  This  issue  will  be  discussed further below.

Safety  pharmacology  studies  in  rat,  dog  and  monkey  gave  no  evidence  for  safety  risks.  However, based on the data from toxicology studies in the rat the relevance of the rat for safety assessment is questionable. The lack of hERG channel inhibition, lack of cardiovascular findings in the dog safety pharmacology  study  and  in  the  monkey  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  do  give  some  reassurance  that lenalidomide is devoid of cardiovascular effects.

Pharmacokinetics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration in rats and monkeys. Bioavailability varies between  50-75%.  The  elimination  half-life  in  rats  and  monkeys  is  approximately  2  and  13 hours, respectively,  after  a  single  oral  administration.  In  humans,  terminal  half-life  is  dependent  on  dose (3.2 hours at 5 mg and 8.7 hours at 400 mg). Lenalidomide is widely distributed with a high volume of distribution. In a whole body autoradiography study in the rat, tissues levels were comparable to the plasma values. In pregnant animals, distribution to the foetus was observed.

In vitro metabolism studies showed no evidence for metabolism of lenalidomide. In vivo, metabolites formed by hydrolysis were observed. However, it was apparent that such hydrolysis products were formed ex  vivo and  the  presented  data  did  not  allow  a  clear  estimate  of  in  vivo  hydrolysis.  A comparison  of  data  from  different  studies  with  labelled  lenalidomide  vs.  non-labelled  lenalidomide suggests that a vast majority of the administered product is present as intact lenalidomide in plasma. Lenalidomide  is  produced  as  a  racemic  mixture  of  two  enantiomers.  Individual  enantiomers  were shown to undergo significant non-enzymatic racemisation in human plasma (complete after 6 hours).

After intravenous administration in rats and monkeys, the majority of the compound was excreted in urine, while after oral administration equal amounts were found in urine and faeces. This suggests that renal elimination is the main excretion path, while after oral dosing a substantial part is not absorbed and found in the faeces. There are no data on excretion in milk or in semen. For thalidomide, excretion in  semen  has  been  demonstrated  and  measures  have  been  taken  to  protect  women  from  exposure during sexual intercourse with patients taking thalidomide. Data on the presence of lenalidomide in semen  are  required  in  order  to  take  a  decision  whether  similar  measures  should  be  introduced  for lenalidomide.

## Toxicology

The primary toxicities observed after repeated oral administrations of lenalidomide were associated with the haematopoietic lympho-reticular systems and the kidneys, generally reversible after a 4- to 7-week  recovery  period.  Rats  appeared  to  be  more  sensitive  to  the  effects  on  the  kidneys,  while cynomolgus monkeys were more sensitive to the effects on the haematopoietic systems. The NOAEL for rats in the chronic 26-week toxicity study was set at &lt; 75 mg/kg/day. Based on AUC comparison, this dose was approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure. In repeated-dose toxicity studies  in  monkeys,  NOAEL  is  less  than  1 mg/kg;  this  dose  was  equivalent  to  the  human  daily exposure (safety margin: 0.95 to 1).

The findings in monkey are likely to be a consequence of the pharmacological effect of lenalidomide and show similarity to what has been seen in the clinic, where neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the  most  common  adverse  effects.  The  findings  in  the  rat  and  the  monkey  underline  the  striking species  differences  in  pharmacology  and  toxicology  of  lenalidomide,  and  it  is  concluded  that  the monkey but not the rat is a relevant species for safety evaluation.

For the non-clinical safety evaluation it is not possible to reach any conclusion on safety profile of Revlimid compared to thalidomide.

Lenalidomide showed  no  evidence for genotoxicity. Further in vitro characterisation of the genotoxicity of the active substance including impurities will be performed as a follow-up measure.

No studies on carcinogenicity have been performed which is acceptable for the proposed indication.

The most important issue for the non-clinical assessment of lenalidomide safety is reproductive and developmental toxicity, given the structural and pharmacological similarities with thalidomide. Studies on fertility and early embryonic development and on pre-natal and post-natal have been performed in the rat. These studies showed no evidence for important toxicity but the relevance and sensitivity of the rat is questionable as the presented data on general toxicity of lenalidomide show minimal toxicity in this species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Embryo-foetal development has been studied in rats and rabbits. The rat study showed no evidence of toxicity, but the rat species is not considered as a relevant model for thalidomide analogues as it is poorly susceptible to thalidomide teratogenicity.

In the rabbit, lenalidomide exhibited foetal toxicity with increased post-implantation loss, decreased foetal weight, and also an increased frequency of foetal alterations (absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung and displaced kidneys). Lenalidomide did not induce, in particular, any limb malformations in the rabbit.

Based  on  the  structural  and  pharmacological  similarity  to  thalidomide  and  the  foetal  alterations observed in the rabbit study, lenalidomide has to be contraindicated during pregnancy, and precautions should be taken for women of childbearing potential.

The embryotoxic and teratogenic potential of lenalidomide will be further characterised in a sensitive species (follow-up measure).

## 1.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Lenalidomide, at the dose of 25 mg/day in combination with dexamethasone (40 mg/day) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Lenalidomide 25 mg/day is taken orally on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle, and 40 mg/day of dexamethasone on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12 and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles, with reduction to 40 mg/day of dexamethasone on days 1 to 4 of each cycle thereafter.

## GCP

According to the applicant, all studies were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice guidelines and considerations for the ethical treatment of human subjects. The applicant has provided a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were  carried  out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The analytical method used for the detection of lenalidomide in blood and urine samples is a liquid chromatography  method  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric  detection  (LC-MS/MS).  These  methods were properly validated and associated with satisfactory lower limits of quantitation.

## · Absorption

Absolute bioavailability has not been determined in humans. However, results from animal studies and clinical pharmacokinetics show that absorption is linear and rapid. Lenalidomide can be taken either before or after food, taking into consideration that co-administration with food delays absorption of the active substance.

## · Distribution

The binding of radiolabelled 'semi-racemic' lenalidomide to human plasma proteins was investigated in vitro by ultrafiltration at concentrations of 30-10000 ng/ml. The mean binding was 23 and 29% in plasma  from  myeloma  patients  and  healthy  volunteers,  respectively.  No  concentration  dependency was observed. The apparent oral volume of distribution was different between doses and studies but may be in the order 50-200 l.

## · Elimination

Lenalidomide is not metabolised via cytochrome P450 in humans and further enzymatic systems have not been studied. The excretion of lenalidomide via the renal pathway is high, with the overall urinary recovery of unchanged drug being approximately 85% of the administered single oral dose. Urinary excretion of lenalidomide is approximately 27% lower when lenalidomide is administered in the fed condition compared to fast condition. Renal clearance was at least 190 ml/min, suggesting that active renal secretion occurs.

In  vitro studies  investigating  which  transporters  are  involved  in  the  active  renal  secretion  of lenalidomide are ongoing. The applicant committed to submit the results of mass-balance 14C study.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The  pharmacokinetic  disposition  of  lenalidomide  is  linear  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients.  The maximum  concentration  (Cmax)  and  area-under-the-curve  (AUC)  increased  in  a  dose-proportional manner over the dose range studied (5 to 400 mg).

There is  no  clinically  important  time-  or  dose-dependency  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenalidomide when administered to healthy volunteers or patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Special populations

No formal studies have been conducted to assess the effects of age, gender, race or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide.

Study CC-5013-PK-001 studied the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide after a single 25 mg oral dose under  fasting  conditions  in  subjects  of  different  degrees  of  renal  function  and  in  patients  with  end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis as follows:

|       5 |   6 | End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) | Requiring dialysis                     |

Subjects with ESRD received 2 single 25 mg doses at least 7 days apart: 1 dose was on a non-dialysis day and one 3 hours before a 4-hour haemodialysis period

A decrease in renal function resulted in an increase in total exposure (mean AUCt and AUC ∞ ).  C max and tmax were not markedly affected by renal impairment. The exposure of the R and S-enantiomers were  similarly  affected  by  renal  impairment.  Subjects  with  normal  renal  function  had  higher  mean % dose excreted unchanged in urine (85%), followed by subjects with mild RI (69%), subjects with moderate RI (42%) and subjects with severe RI (44%).

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The potential for lenalidomide to cause drug-drug interactions was investigated in vitro and in vivo . A study  to  investigate  the  inhibitory  effects  of  lenalidomide  on  the  activities  of  selected  P-450 cytochromes  has  been  carried  out in  vitro to  show  that  it  is  unlikely  that  lenalidomide  causes metabolic  drug  interactions  by  inhibiting  CYP  activities.  A  study  on  the  potential  interaction  of lenalidomide with p-glycoprotein is currently being completed.

Results from a chronic study in monkeys showed that lenalidomide at the dose of up to 2 mg/kg/day causes no notable effects on hepatic, microsomal protein or cytochrome P450 concentrations or on the activities of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP3A, or CYP4A. Regarding the potential interaction with drugs  having  a  high  plasma-protein  binding  potential,  the  weak  plasma-protein  binding  rate  of lenalidomide  (19%-29%)  in  all  species  including  humans,  makes  the  risk  of  drug-drug  interactions related to displacement from plasmatic proteins, unlikely. However, formal clinical interaction studies have only been conducted for warfarin and digoxin, two frequently used drugs in the target population of patients. While no effect of lenalidomide on either enantiomer of warfarin was detected, there may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be  a  possible  drug  interaction  between  lenalidomide  and  digoxin,  although  it  may  not  be  clinically relevant.

In the recommended treatment regime, lenalidomide is administered with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone  has  been  observed  to  induce  metabolising  enzymes  in  vivo  in  lower  doses  than recommended  here.  The  degree  of  induction  when  dexamethasone  is  used  in  the  recommended intermittent  dose  regime  has  not  been  studied.  It  may  not  be  excluded  that  the  dexamethasone component may give rise to reduced systemic exposure to concomitantly administered drugs which are metabolised by CYP or Phase II enzymes or transported by transport proteins. Due to the difficulties in  performing  a  conclusive  study,  no in  vivo study  is  requested.  The  risk  of  reduced  levels  of contraceptive steroids has been reflected in the SPC. An in vitro study of the possible inducing effect of lenalidomide is ongoing.

## Warfarin

Co-administration  of  multiple  doses  of  10 mg  of  lenalidomide  had  no  effect  on  the  single  dose pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenalidomide.  However,  it  is  not  known  whether  there  is  an interaction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak to  moderate  enzyme  inducer  and  its  effect  on  warfarin  is  unknown.  Close  monitoring  of  warfarin concentration is advised during the treatment.

## Digoxin

Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg/day increased the plasma exposure of digoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52%-28.2%]. It is not known whether  the  effect  will  be  different  in  the  therapeutic  situation  (higher  lenalidomide  doses  and concomitant  treatment  with  dexamethasone).  Therefore,  monitoring  of  the  digoxin  concentration  is advised during lenalidomide treatment.

## · Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have been conducted other than those already conducted to study pharmacokinetic interactions, namely: to determine extent of in vitro binding of (14C)-lenalidomide to plasma proteins, to determine the effect of lenalidomide on selected cytochrome P450 activities in human liver microsomes; to identify human P450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of lenalidomide and to investigate the in vitro metabolism of (14C)-lenalidomide in human hepatocytes.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Primary and secondary pharmacology

Cytokine  modulation:  lenalidomide  inhibits  the  secretion  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  including TNFα ,  interleukin-1  beta  (IL-1 β ),  IL-6  and  IL-12  and  increases  the  secretion  of  anti-inflammatory cytokine  IL-10  from  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells.  In  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-stimulated PBMC, a dose-dependent inhibition for the following cytokines: TNFα ,  IL-1 β , IL-6, IL-12, MCP-1 and MIP-1 α and a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on IL-10 were observed.

Induction of T-cell proliferation: lenalidomide elevates IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFNγ ) production,  and  natural  killer  cell  activities  are  induced.  In  anti-CD3  stimulated  CD4+  T-cells, stimulation of IFNγ , IL-2 and RANTES was observed. NK cell-mediated killing of tumour cells was more than doubled at 1 mg/ml.

Anti-proliferative  effects: in  vitro ,  lenalidomide  inhibited  proliferation  of  the  MM  cell  line  MM.1S and the Hs  Sultan lymphoma  cell. Lenalidomide  also inhibited the proliferation of various haematopoietic  tumour  cell  lines,  in  particular  those  with  cytogenetic  defects  of  chromosome  5, e.g., the Namalwa cell line.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inhibition of angiogenesis: lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the formation of microvessels and endothelial cell tubes as well as the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells in in vitro angiogenesis models. In a human tissue culture model of angiogenesis, lenalidomide inhibited the microvessel formation emanating from an arterial explant in a dose-dependent manner.

Induction of foetal haemoglobin (HbF): lenalidomide enhances expression upon CD34+ haematopoietic  stem  cell  differentiation  in  a  model  of  erythroid  progenitor  differentiation.  When CD34+ cells were cultured in the presence or absence of lenalidomide and hydroxyurea, alone or in combination, the induction of HbF production with lenalidomide was similar to that of hydroxyurea and there was a major synergistic effect when lenalidomide (10 µ M) was combined with hydroxyurea, resulting in a striking reactivation of HbF.

Secondary pharmacology studies were conducted in two healthy volunteer PK-PD studies (Studies 1398/142  and  1398/180)  and  suggest  that  lenalidomide  could  have  an  effect  on  immune response.

Study  1398/142:  lenalidomide  appeared  to  have  a  possible  effect  on  the  immune  response.  An apparent  dose-related  decrease  in  CD4  count  was  observed  at  the  higher  dose  levels  of  200 mg lenalidomide  (fasted  and  fed)  and  400 mg  lenalidomide  (fasted)  with  the  most  pronounced  effect occurring at 48-hour post-dose. In contrast, the CD8 count showed no treatment-related changes over time.

Study  1398/180:  Multiple  dosing  with  lenalidomide  appeared  to  have  an  effect  upon  the  immune response. An apparent dose-related decrease in both CD4 and CD8 blood counts was observed from Day 4 onwards. For CD4  counts, the magnitude of the decreases was relatively constant (approximately  300 /mm 3 )  on  Days  4,  6  and  8,  with  values  approaching  baseline  levels  by  the post-study assessment. By contrast, decreases in mean CD8 counts were most pronounced on Day 8 (242 /mm 3 ), with levels still considerably lower than the baseline value at the post-study assessment.

## · Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide have not been studied. Lenalidomide has been  used  in  clinical  trials  in  multiple  myeloma  patients  up  to  86  years  of  age.  The  percentage  of patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between the lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone  groups.  No  overall  difference  in  safety  or  efficacy  was  observed  between these  patients  and  younger  patients,  but  greater  pre-disposition  of  older  individuals  cannot  be  ruled out. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function.

Lenalidomide is substantially excreted by the kidney, therefore care should be taken in dose selection and monitoring of renal function is advised.

The following dose adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy for patients with impaired renal function.

| Renal Function                                                                                                                                                       | Drug Dose Adjustment                                                                                                      |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies to elucidate the lenalidomide anti-tumour effect like identifying and validating lenalidomide-binding  proteins  and  developing  a  panel  of  lenalidomide-responsive  cell  models, independent of siRNA technology, are ongoing.

Since lenalidomide is mainly renally excreted unchanged, lenalidomide has not formally been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and there are no specific dose recommendations.

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Lenalidomide may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical efficacy and safety of lenalidomide has been investigated in one Phase I/II and in two Phase III clinical trials.

## · Dose-response study(ies)

One  single-centre,  open-label,  non-randomised  Phase  I/II,  dose  escalation  study  was  conducted  to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered lenalidomide in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma.

Four dose levels of 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg/day of lenalidomide were evaluated.

The MTD of lenalidomide was observed to be 25 mg/day. Myelosuppression was the primary adverse event associated with the administration of lenalidomide.

All  27  patients  experienced  at  least  one  treatment-emergent  AE.  The  most  common  AE  were leucopenia (70.4%; 19/27) with 100% of patients at the 25-mg dose and thrombocytopenia (51.9%; 14/27). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 59.3% (85.7% at 50 mg/day). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 29.6%.

Myelosuppression accounted for most of the adverse events that resulted in discontinuation from the study or in dose reduction (12 out of 13 patients).

Study CC-5013-MM-09 title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel-group, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of CC-5013  Plus Dexamethasone  Versus  Dexamethasone  Alone  in Previously Treated Subjects With Multiple Myeloma

Study CC-5013-MM-010 title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel-group, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of CC-5013  Plus Dexamethasone  Versus  Dexamethasone  Alone  in Previously Treated Subjects With Multiple Myeloma

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Selection  criteria  were  similar  for  both  studies:  patients  aged  18  years  or  older  who  had  a  prior  or current  Durie-Salmon  Stage  II  or  III  multiple  myeloma  and  who  were  considered  to  have  disease progression  after  at  least  2  cycles  of  anti-myeloma  treatment  or  to  have  relapsed  with  progressive disease after treatment. Patients with measurable levels of M-paraprotein in serum ( ≥ 0.5 g/dl) or urine ( ≥ 0.2 g excreted in 24-hours collection sample) and an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 were eligible for the study. Patients could have been previously treated with thalidomide and/or radiation therapy,  however,  those  with  prior  disease  progression  during  high-dose  dexamethasone  were excluded.

Treatments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients  were  randomised  to  lenalidomide  plus  oral  high-dose  dexamethasone  or  placebo  plus  oral high-dose  dexamethasone.  Patients  in  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  group  were  administered 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on Day 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on Day  22  to  28  of  each  28-day  cycle.  Patients  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  group  took  1  placebo capsule  on  all days  of the 28-day  cycle. Patients  in  both  treatment  groups  took  40 mg  of dexamethasone orally once daily on Day 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. Beginning with Cycle 5, the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Day 1 to 4 every 28 days for the remaining cycles.

## Objectives

The objective of these studies was to determine the efficacy and the safety of lenalidomide.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was time-to-progression (TTP) for both studies, calculated as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of progressive disease based on the myeloma response criteria  developed  by  Bladé et  al ,  or  discontinuation  from  the  treatment  phase  due  to  progressive disease according to the investigator, or death due to progressive disease during the treatment period.

Sensitivity  analyses  were  also  performed  including  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  which  was defined as the time from randomisation to documented progression (as defined above) or death due to any reason during the treatment period, whichever occurred first.

The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  overall  survival  (OS),  the  myeloma  response  rate,  the time-to-first symptomatic skeletal-related events (SRE) and the time-to-first worsening in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.

## Sample size

For TTP, a 50% improvement in median time-to-progression, from 6 months for dexamethasone alone to  9 months  on  the  combination  lenalidomide  plus  dexamethasone  was  considered  as  clinically relevant. With accrual of about 25 to 26 patients per month for 12 months for a total of 302 patients and a 9-month follow-up after the study closes to accrual, a one-sided log-rank test with an overall significance level of 0.025 would have 85% power to detect a hazard rate ratio of 1.5. Full information necessary for a log-rank test to have 85% power would be achieved when an event had been observed for at least 222 patients.

## Randomisation

Patients  in  both  studies  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone group or the placebo/dexamethasone group.

Randomisation was stratified by the following prognostic factors:

- -Baseline serum beta2 ( β 2)-microglobulin level ( ≤ 2.5 mg/l versus &gt; 2.5 mg/l)
- -Prior therapy with high-dose chemotherapy supported by stem cell transplant (SCT) or no such prior therapy
- -The number of prior anti-myeloma regimens (1 versus ≥ 1)

## Blinding (masking)

The studies were double-blinded.

## Statistical methods

An  unstratified  log-rank  test  was  used  as  the  primary  test  to  compare  survivorship  functions  for time-to-event variables in the 2 treatment groups. Exact test procedures for proportions were used to compare response rates.

In  both  studies,  an  interim  analysis  was  planned  when  an  event  had  been  observed  for  50%  of  the patients to determine if the study should be stopped for superiority, futility, or unfavourable toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  boundary  for  declaring  superiority  of  one  treatment  group  over  the  other  was  based  on  an alpha-spending function of the O'Brien-Fleming type.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

Study MM-009: Three hundred fifty-three (353) patients were randomised (177 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group and 176 in the placebo/dexamethasone group).

Study MM-010: Three hundred fifty-one (351) patients were randomised (176 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone  group  and  175  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  group).  This  study  was amended to increase the sample size to 374 patients to gain additional safety data. In August 2004, the decision was made to suspend enrolment after 351 patients had been enrolled.

Overall survival for Study MM-009 showed a significant survival advantage for lenalidomide/dexamethasone relative to placebo/dexamethasone. Thirty-seven (20.9%) of the 177 lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated  patients,  compared  with  62  (35.2%)  of  the  176 of  the placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients, had died. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, median OS was 93.4 weeks for the placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients.

No significant difference in OS had been observed between the lenalidomide/dexamethasone- and the placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients in Study MM-010 (47 and 59 deaths, respectively).

The overall survival in the pooled studies at one year was  82%  in patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone  versus  75%  in  patients  treated  with  placebo/dexamethasone,  after  the start of treatment, with a median follow-up duration of 98.0 weeks (min: 0.3, max: 163.3). Despite the fact  that  170  out  of  the  351 patients  randomised  to  placebo/dexamethasone  received  treatment  with lenalidomide/dexamethasone after the studies were unmasked, the pooled analysis of OS demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage for lenalidomide/dexamethasone relative to placebo/dexamethasone (hazard/odds ratio: 0.75, 95% CI: [0.59, 0.95], p = 0.015).

Results of TTP/PFS on the subgroup of patients showing primary resistance on thalidomide confirmed the  effectiveness  of  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  treatment  compared  to  placebo/dexamethasone. Even in the subset of patients previously treated thalidomide who developed progressive disease or who had progressive disease as best response, TTP and PFS times were significantly prolonged in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No  studies  in  special  populations  e.g.  in  children,  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  with  hepatic impairment was performed.

Subgroup analyses by gender, age, baseline serum β 2-microglobulin level, prior therapy, and number of prior anti-myeloma regimens were conducted separately for Studies MM-009 and MM-010. In both studies,  differences  in  TTP,  favouring  lenalidomide/dexamethasone,  were  observed  irrespective  of gender,  age,  baseline  serum β 2-microglobulin  level,  prior  therapy  with  high-dose  chemotherapy  or SCT or not, and the number of prior anti-myeloma regimens.

Study  CC-5013-CHF-00-001  is  a  single-centre,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  dose-escalation study of lenalidomide in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV heart failure. Three  dose  levels  were  planned:  5,  10  and  25  mg/day.  Up  to  21  patients  were  to  be  enrolled, depending upon the level at which toxicity was observed. At each dose level, seven patients were to be randomised  to  either  study  drug  or  placebo  at  a  ratio  of  5:2.  The  primary  endpoint  was  safety,  as assessed by adverse events, ECG, and serum chemistry, haematology and urinalysis. The secondary endpoints were the change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter after 12 weeks, as measured by 2-dimensional echocardiogram and the change in left ventricular ejection fraction after 12 weeks, as measured by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) study.

The  study  was  terminated  by  recommendation  of  the  data  safety  monitoring  board  (DSMB)  after completion of the 5 and 10 mg dose-groups with 14 of the planned 21 patients enrolled. The DSMB recommended  that  no  additional  patients  be  enrolled  into  the  study  due  to  the  absence  of  obvious benefit and the inability to rule out the potential safety concern of hyperthyroidism.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg orally once daily on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day  cycles.  The  recommended  dose  of  dexamethasone  is  40 mg  orally  once  daily  on  Days  1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy and then 40 mg once daily on days 1-4 every 28 days. Dosing is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lenalidomide treatment must not be started if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &lt; 1.0 x 10 9 /l, and/or  platelet  count  is  &lt;  75  x  10 9 /l  or,  dependent  on  bone  marrow  infiltration  by  plasma  cells, platelet count is &lt; 30 x 10 9 /l.

The outcome of the primary analysis, the sensitivity analyses and the secondary analysis is consistent and convincing in showing that lenalidomide is effective in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Analysis of OS for Study MM-009 showed a significant survival advantage for lenalidomide/dexamethasone relative to placebo/dexamethasone.

Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  separately  for  Studies MM-009  and  MM-010.  Significant differences in TTP, favouring lenalidomide/dexamethasone, were observed irrespective of gender, age, baseline serum β 2-microglobulin level, prior therapy with high-dose chemotherapy or SCT or not, and the number of prior anti-myeloma regimens.

Lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared with placebo/dexamethasone was effective in terms of TTP and PFS in the subgroup of patients showing primary resistance on thalidomide, and even in the subset of  patients  previously  treated  with  thalidomide  who  developed  progressive  disease  while  treated  or who had progressive disease as best response.

In  the  pivotal  trials,  only  a  minority  of  patients  had  received  bortezomib  (54/704  in  both  pivotal studies).  In  the  patients  who  had  received  prior  bortezomib  therapy,  TTP  was  significantly  longer among the lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients than among the placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients. Prior treatment with bortezomib has no obvious effect on the efficacy of lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination.

At  the  time  of  submission,  there  was  no  experience  in  children  and  adolescents.  Therefore, lenalidomide should not be used in the paediatric age group (0-17 years) even if the multiple myeloma does not affect this age group.

## Clinical safety

The  assessment  of  the  safety  profile  of  lenalidomide  in  the  claimed  indication  was  focused  on  the two main studies (MM-009 and MM-010) evaluating efficacy and the safety of lenalidomide plus oral pulse  high-dose  of  dexamethasone  versus  oral  pulse  high-dose  of  dexamethasone  alone  in  patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Safety evaluations included physical examination, vital signs, haematology and biochemical testing, thyroid function tests (TSH, tri-iodothyronine [T3], and thyroxine [T4] were determined at screening/baseline,  every  8  weeks  starting  with  Cycle  2,  and  at  treatment  discontinuation),  12-lead ECG, appropriate imaging studies and a pregnancy test for female participants.

## · Patient exposure

The pooled safety database as of 31 December 2005 includes 703 patients (353 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone  group  and  350 in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  group).  Table  11  details the patient exposure for the 2 pivotal studies.

NOS, not otherwise specified

Anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, constipation, pneumonia, weight decreased, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia,  tremor,  rash,  and  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  were  reported  significantly  more frequently in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group than in the placebo/dexamethasone group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the primary reasons for dose reductions in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group.

Cardiac adverse events are more frequently reported in lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm (18.1%) than in placebo/dexamethasone arm (11.1%), particularly atrial fibrillation (4.2% including 3.1% serious) with lenalidomide/dexamethasone and 1.1% with placebo/dexamethasone (0.6% were serious). Of the 69  lenalidomide-treated  patients  experiencing  cardiac  adverse  events  (including  irregular  hear  rate, cardiac  murmur,  decreased  ejection  fraction  and  abnormal  ECG,  Q  wave,  ST-T  segment  and prolonged QT), 56 were found to have had either an underlying conditions or were taking concomitant medications (i.e., beta blocker, Ca channel blocker, anti-arrhythmic, etc.).

Peripheral  neuropathy:  only  few  cases  suggesting  a  peripheral  neuropathy  are  reported  in  those 2 studies, and their incidence is comparable between lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups (about 5 to 8% of drug-related peripheral sensory neuropathies/paraesthesia).

Vascular  disorders:  there  was  a  significant  increased  risk  for  developing  thromboembolic  adverse events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared  with  placebo/dexamethasone-treated  patients  (9.1%  versus  4.3%  and  4.0%  versus  0.9%, respectively).  Risk  factors  have  been  identified:  1)  concomitant  erythropoietin  treatment  (EPO), 2) thrombosis past medical history, 3) older age and 4) lower baseline plasma cell. Moreover, all of the cases of thrombosis presented rising M-paraprotein at baseline.

NOS, not otherwise specified

As of 31 December 2005, 107 (30.3%) deaths had been reported among the 353 lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated  patients and  142  (40.5%)  deaths  had  been  reported  among the 351 placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients. The primary cause of death in both treatment groups was disease progression (70/107 in lenalidomide/dexamethasone group and 101/142 in placebo/dexamethasone group).

Of the 107 deaths in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group, 24 were suspected by the investigators to be related to the study medication. Of the 142 deaths in the placebo/dexamethasone group, 24 were suspected by the investigator to be related to the study medication.

## · Laboratory findings

No clinically significant changes were noted for vital signs measurements or clinical laboratory values. This included thyroid-stimulating hormone, the thyroid function test.

No  clinically  important  effects  of  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  relative  to  placebo/dexamethasone were observed on ECG. A small number of patients in each treatment group (2 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone  group  and  3 in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  group)  had  a  worsening (e.g., a normal finding at baseline and a clinically significant finding at the end of treatment) in their

ECG  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  treatment;  the  follow-up  ECG  abnormalities  were  generally  not suspected by the investigators to be related to treatment with the study medications.

Little variation in body weight was observed in either treatment group during the study. Mean body weight  decreased  in  both  treatment  groups  during  the  first  6 cycles  of  therapy  and  then  tended  to increase after Cycle 6.

## · Safety in special populations

No formal studies have been conducted to assess the effects of age, gender, race or hepatic impairment on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenalidomide.  However,  the  available  clinical  data  do  not  indicate  that adjustments in the dose of lenalidomide are needed for safety-related reasons in these subpopulations.

Except  for  Grade  3/4  anaemia,  which  was  reported  significantly  more  frequently  in  females (17.5%; 25/143) than in males (6.2%; 13/210) and DVT was reported significantly more frequently in males (11.0%; 23/210) than in females (3.5%; 53/143) in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group. No other significant differences between genders were observed.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  was  investigated  in  2  interaction  studies  and  assessed  by adverse events, clinical laboratory findings, physical examinations, vital signs, and ECG.

## Warfarin interaction study

There were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory findings, physical examinations, vital  signs,  or  ECG.  The  adverse  events  were  all  mild  in  severity  and  evenly  divided  between lenalidomide  and  placebo.  The  most  frequent  adverse  events  were  dermatological  and  were  also evenly reported by lenalidomide (35% of subjects) and placebo (41% of subjects), beginning after the warfarin dose on Day 4. As expected during warfarin therapy, elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised ratio (INR) were observed during the study. However, based on a comparison of the PT and INR values that were observed during co-administration of placebo and warfarin and those that were observed during co-administration of lenalidomide and warfarin, co-administration of lenalidomide had no effect on PT or INR. Moreover, the results of this study show no pharmacokinetic or  pharmacodynamic  interactions  between  lenalidomide  and  warfarin;  therefore,  lenalidomide  and warfarin may be co-administered.

## Digoxin interaction study

Only 3 mild adverse events (headache, sinus headache, somnolence) were reported by 3 (16%) of the 19 subjects dosed in this study. The adverse events occurred in the placebo group prior to digoxin administration.  There  were  neither  serious  adverse  events  reported,  nor  subjects  were  discontinued from the study due to adverse events and all adverse events resolved without therapy.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  the  pivotal  studies,  treatment  discontinuations  rates  for  adverse  events  were  comparable between the  2  treatment  groups,  Table 14  provides  details  on  the  main  adverse  events  leading  to  treatment discontinuation.

## · Post-marketing experience

Lenalidomide was approved in the United States on 27 December 2005 and data were available on 5075 medically confirmed adverse reactions  have been  reported  in  2275  patients  during  the  period covered by a Periodic Safety Update Report. Of these, 2087 were serious. There were 194 reports with fatal  outcome.  Of  these,  the  primary  cause  of  death  was  the  progression  of  the  disease  in  33%  of reports,  unknown or unreported in 36% of the reports. For the other reports, the primary causes of death for the other reports were sepsis (n = 11), pneumonia (n = 7), leukaemia (n = 6), cardiac failure congestive (n = 4), renal failure (n = 4) and myocardial infarction (n = 4).

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Treatment  with  Revlimid  must  be  initiated  and  monitored  under  the  supervision  of  physicians experienced in the management of multiple myeloma (MM).

Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance  that  causes  severe  life-threatening  birth  defects.  The  teratogenic  effect  of  lenalidomide cannot be ruled out. For lenalidomide no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in animals have shown  embryofoetal  toxicity. Therefore, lenalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  use  effective  method  of  contraception.  If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. For  male  patients  taking  lenalidomide,  there  is  no  clinical  data  available  on  the  presence  of lenalidomide  in  human  semen.  Therefore  male  patients  taking  lenalidomide  should  use  condoms  if their partner is of childbearing potential and has no contraception.

The potential teratogenicity induced by lenalidomide in human is still the main safety issue that needs further  investigation.  The  combination  with  dexamethasone  is  also  problematic  since  this  drug possesses  liver  enzyme  induction  capacities,  which  might  affect  the  pregnancy  protection  with anti-contraceptive pills. No interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also affect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during treatment. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy must be taken (as detailed in the SPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pooled safety data, including adverse events, laboratory findings, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG)  data,  from  two  pivotal,  Phase III,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled studies of lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination therapy versus placebo/dexamethasone therapy, were provided as evidence of the safety of the lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (Study MM-009 and Study MM-010); 353 patients were treated with the lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 350 patients were treated with placebo/dexamethasone in these studies.

The most serious adverse reactions were:

- Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (as stated in the SPC,
- Grade 4 neutropenia (as stated in the SPC).

The  most  frequently  observed  drug-related  adverse  events  which  occurred  significantly  more frequently in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to the placebo/dexamethasone group were:  neutropenia  (39.4%),  fatigue  (27.2%),  asthenia  (17.6%),  constipation  (23.5%),  muscle  cramp (20.1%), thrombocytopenia (18.4%), anaemia (17.0%), diarrhoea (14.2%) and rash (10.2%).

Among  the  SAE  reported  at  a  higher  than  1%  frequency  serious  DVT,  pulmonary  embolism  and cardiac  disorders  including  serious  atrial  fibrillation  occurred  more  commonly  in  the  lenalidomide exposed  population.  DVT  occurred  in  25  versus  11  patients  and  pulmonary  embolism  occurred  in 11 versus 3 patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone vs. placebo/dexamethasone. A dose-dependent  thrombotic  risk  for  lenalidomide  has  been  observed.  Other  factors  associated  with thrombotic risk included the concomitant use of erythropoietin/growth factors, past medical history, older age, and lower baseline plasma cell.

No formal studies have been conducted to assess the effects of age, gender, race or hepatic impairment on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lenalidomide.  However,  the  available  clinical  data  do  not  indicate  that adjustments in the dose of lenalidomide are needed for safety-related reasons in these subpopulations. Since  multiple  myeloma  affects  an  elderly  population  it  is  of  interest  to  further  investigate  age  in relation to side effects of lenalidomide.

It is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in human milk. Therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued during therapy with lenalidomide.

There  is  no  specific  experience  in  the  management  of  lenalidomide  overdose  in  multiple  myeloma patients,  although  in  dose-ranging  studies  some  patients  were  exposed  to  up  to  50  mg.  The  dose limiting toxicity in these studies was essentially haematological. In the event of overdose, supportive care is advised.

## 1.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

|                | • Data from US Rev Assist Programme whereby accurate post-market exposure data is available • Continuous follow-up of use and lenalidomide indications after approval in the EU (to be adapted on a country basis) |                                         |

The  Risk  Management  Plan  is  adequate  to  address  the  issue  of  teratogenicity  and  other  safety concerns.

Special  caution  is  recommended  regarding  other  adverse  events,  less  frequently  reported  but compatible with a pharmacovigilance signal:

- -Cardiac function: changes in ECG, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia
- -Metabolic disorders: hypokalaemia
- -Endocrine disorders: hypothyroidism
- -Visual disorders: blurred vision

Given morbidity and/or mortality usually associated with those adverse events, a preventive treatment should be considered at least for patients with identified risk factors even if there is no specific data proving efficacy for prevention of lenalidomide induced-thrombotic events. Since efficacy of aspirin on thrombotic events prophylaxis has not been proved, preventive treatment should be heparin or oral anticoagulant.  Consequently,  the  Applicant  is  asked  to  perform  a  randomized,  comparative,  clinical study assessing the efficacy of prophylactic treatment for thrombotic events in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide.

## Recommended dose adjustments during treatment and restart of treatment

Dose adjustments, as summarised below, are recommended to manage Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, or other grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide.

## · Dose reduction steps

| Starting dose   | 25 mg   |

## Pregnancy warning

Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide cannot be ruled out.

The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential.

## Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential

A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets at least one of the following criteria:

- Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year *
- Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy
- Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist
- XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis.

## Counselling

For women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met:

- She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child
- She  understands  the  need  for  effective  contraception,  without  interruption,  4  weeks  before starting  treatment,  throughout  the  entire  duration  of  treatment,  and  4  weeks  after  the  end  of treatment
- Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on effective contraception
- She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures
- She  is  informed  and  understands  the  potential  consequences  of  pregnancy  and  the  need  to rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy
- She  understands  the  need  to  commence  the  treatment  as  soon  as  lenalidomide  is  dispensed following a negative pregnancy test
- She understands  the  need  and  accepts  to  undergo  pregnancy  testing  every  4  weeks  except  in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation
- She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide.

* Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For  male  patients  taking  lenalidomide,  there  is  no  clinical  data  available  on  the  presence  of lenalidomide in human semen. Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions:

- Understand  the  potential  teratogenic  risk  if  engaged  in  sexual  activity  with  a  woman  of childbearing potential
- Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a woman of childbearing potential.

The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential:

- The  patient  complies  with  the  conditions  for  Pregnancy  Prevention  Programme,  including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding
- The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions.

## Contraception

Women of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for 4 weeks before therapy,  during  therapy,  and  until  4  weeks  after  lenalidomide  therapy  and  even  in  case  of  dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis.  If  not  established  on  effective  contraception,  the  patient  must  be  referred  to  an  appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be initiated.

The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception:

- Implant
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot
- Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)
- Tubal sterilisation
- Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses
- Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (as stated in the SPC, section 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4 -6 weeks  after  discontinuing  combined  oral  contraception.  The  efficacy  of  contraceptive  steroids may be reduced during co-treatment with dexamethasone (as stated in the SPC, section 4.5).

Implants  and  levonorgestrel-releasing  intrauterine  systems  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of infection  at  the  time  of  insertion  and  irregular  vaginal  bleeding.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  should  be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.

Copper-releasing  intrauterine  devices  are  generally  not  recommended  due  to  the  potential  risks  of infection  at  the  time  of  insertion  and  menstrual  blood  loss  which  may  compromise  patients  with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

## Pregnancy testing

According  to  local  practice,  medically  supervised  pregnancy  tests  with  a  minimum  sensitivity  of 25 IU/ml must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below.

## Prior to starting treatment

A  medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation,  when lenalidomide is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts treatment with lenalidomide.

Follow-up and end of treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated every 4 weeks, including 4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber.

## Men

It  is  not  known  whether  lenalidomide  is  present  in  semen.  Therefore  all  male  patients  should  use condoms throughout treatment  duration,  during  dose  interruption  and  for  1  week  after  cessation  of treatment if their partner is of childbearing potential and has no contraception.

## Additional precautions

Ideally,  pregnancy  testing,  issuing  a  prescription  and  dispensing  should  occur  on  the  same  day. Dispensing of lenalidomide should occur within a maximum of 7 days of the prescription.

Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment.

Patients should not donate blood or semen during therapy or for 1 week following discontinuation of lenalidomide.

## Educational materials

In  order  to  assist  patients  in  avoiding  foetal  exposure  to  lenalidomide,  the  Marketing  Authorisation Holder will provide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about the  potential  teratogenicity  of  lenalidomide,  to  provide  advice  on  contraception  before  therapy  is started, and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the potential teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy Prevention Programme should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male patients.

## Other special warnings and precautions for use

## Venous thromboembolism

The  combination  of  lenalidomide  with  dexamethasone  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with multiple myeloma (as stated in the  SPC,  sections  4.5  and  4.8).  Concomitant  administration  of  erythropoietic  agents  or  previous history of DVT may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. Therefore, erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, should be  used  with  caution  in  multiple  myeloma  patients  receiving  lenalidomide  with  dexamethasone. Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients  should  be  instructed  to  seek  medical  care  if  they  develop  symptoms  such  as  shortness  of breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines, such as low molecular weight heparins or warfarin, should be recommended, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take antithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual patient's underlying risk factors.

## Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia

The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a  higher  incidence  of  grade  4  neutropenia  (5.1%  in  lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated  patients compared  with  0.6%  in  placebo/dexamethasone-treated  patients;  as  stated  in  the  SPC,  section  4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated  patients  compared  to  0.0%  in  placebo/dexamethasone  treated patients;  as  stated  in  the  SPC,  section  4.8).  Patients  should  be  advised  to  promptly  report  febrile episodes. A dose reduction may be required (as stated in the SPC, section 4.2). In case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management.

The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a  higher  incidence  of  grade  3  and  grade  4  thrombocytopenia  (9.9%  and  1.4%,  respectively,  in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; as stated in the SPC, section 4.8). Patients and physicians are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae and epistaxes. A dose reduction may be required (as stated in the SPC, section 4.2).

A complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of lenalidomide treatment and monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias.

The  major  dose  limiting  toxicities  of  lenalidomide  include  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia. Therefore, co-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with caution.

## Renal impairment

Lenalidomide is substantially excreted by the kidney. Therefore care should be taken in dose selection and monitoring of renal function is advised in patients with renal impairment (as stated in the SPC, section 4.2).

## Thyroid function

Cases of hypothyroidism have been reported and monitoring of thyroid function should be considered.

## Peripheral neuropathy

Lenalidomide  is  structurally  related  to  thalidomide,  which  is  known  to  induce  severe  peripheral neuropathy.  At  this  time,  the  neurotoxic  potential  of  lenalidomide  associated  with  long-term  use cannot be ruled out.

## Lactose intolerance

Revlimid capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Unused capsules

Patients should be advised never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of the treatment.

Erythropoietic  agents  or  other  agents  that  may  increase  the  risk  of  thrombosis,  such  as  hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone (as stated in the SPC, sections 4.4 and 4.8).

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following risk minimisation activities as detailed above in this document are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product (see benefit-risk assessment).

## 1.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in the SPC. The documentation provided for the active substance lenalidomide is comprehensive and adequately detailed. The pharmaceutical development is adequate for this oral formulation and took into  consideration  properties  such  as  particle  size  and  polymorphism  and  the  stability  of  the  active substance. The excipients are those typically used for capsule formulations. Similarly, the packaging material  is  well  documented  and  no  incompatibility  has  been  noticed.  The  validation  of  the manufacturing process ensures consistency and reproducibility of the finished medicinal product. The finished  medicinal  product  has  been  satisfactorily  controlled  and  stability  studies  conducted  under ICH conditions showed that the medicinal product is stable throughout the proposed shelf life.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some outstanding quality issues with no impact on the benefit/risk.  The  applicant  undertook  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as  follow-up  measures

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within  an  agreed  timeframe  and  to  submit  variations  if  required  following  the  evaluation  of  this additional information.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Lenalidomide has been developed based on the structure and pharmacology of thalidomide. In vitro data  suggest  that  lenalidomide  is  much  more  potent.  Lenalidomide  was  10-1000  times  more  potent than thalidomide in various in vitro pharmacology studies of immunomodulatory, anti-proliferative, and  pro-erythropoietic  activities.  The  molecular  target  of  lenalidomide  remains  unknown.  In  vivo, lenalidomide was shown to delay tumour growth and prolong survival in a mouse xenograft model with human lymphoma cells. Lenalidomide showed effect on solid tumour cell growth in two mouse models. Inhibition of angiogenesis was demonstrated in an in vivo model in the rat.

The primary toxicities observed after repeated oral administrations of lenalidomide were associated with the haematopoietic lympho-reticular systems and the kidneys, generally reversible after a 4- to 7-week  recovery  period.  Rats  appeared  to  be  more  sensitive  to  the  effects  on  the  kidneys,  while cynomolgus monkeys were more sensitive to the effects on the haematopoietic systems. The NOAEL for rats in the chronic 26-week toxicity study was set at &lt; 75 mg/kg/day. Based on AUC comparison, this dose was approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure. In repeated-dose toxicity studies  in  monkeys,  NOAEL  is  less  than  1 mg/kg;  this  dose  was  equivalent  to  the  human  daily exposure (safety margin: 0.95 to 1).

Lenalidomide showed  no  evidence for genotoxicity. Further in vitro characterisation of the genotoxicity of the active substance including impurities will be performed as a follow-up measure. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been conducted.

A fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  male  and  female  rats,  with  administration  of lenalidomide up to 500 mg/kg/day, produced no parental toxicity and no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development.

Developmental  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits.  In  rats,  lenalidomide  was  not teratogenic  at  oral  doses  of  up  to  500 mg/kg/day.  Nevertheless,  rat  species  is  not  considered  as  a relevant model for thalidomide analogues.

In the rabbit, lenalidomide exhibited foetal toxicity with increased post-implantation loss, decreased foetal weight, and also an increased frequency of foetal alterations (absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung and displaced kidneys) and variations.

Based  on  the  structural  and  pharmacological  similarity  to  thalidomide  and  the  foetal  alterations observed  in the rabbit study, lenalidomide  should  be  contraindicated  during  pregnancy,  and precautions  should  be  taken  for  women  of  childbearing  potential  (see  risk  management  plan).  The embryotoxic and teratogenic potential of lenalidomide will be further characterised as a post-approval commitment, in the most relevant and sensitive species (follow-up measure).

## Efficacy

The lenalidomide mechanism of action includes anti-neoplastic,  anti-angiogenic,  pro-erythropoietic, and immunomodulatory  properties. Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain haematopoietic  tumour  cells  (including  MM  plasma  tumour  cells  and  those  with  deletions  of chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the number of NK T cells, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells  and  the  formation  of  microvessels,  augments  foetal  haemoglobin  production  by  CD34+ haematopoietic  stem  cells,  and  inhibits  production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g.,  TNFα and IL-6) by monocytes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical trials

The  efficacy  and  safety  of  lenalidomide  were  evaluated  in  two  Phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  controlled  studies  (MM-009  and  MM-010)  of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients with  multiple  myeloma.  Out  of  353  patients  in  the  MM-009  and  MM-010  studies  who  received lenalidomide/dexamethasone,  45.6%  were  aged  65  or  over.  Of  the  704  patients  evaluated  in  the MM-009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6% were aged 65 or over.

In both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group took 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once  daily  on  Days  1  to  21  and  a  matching  placebo  capsule  once  daily  on  Days  22  to  28  of  each 28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 28-day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until disease progression. In both studies, dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory finding.

The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients were evaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group and 176 in the placebo/dexamethasone group and, in total, 351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group and 175 in the placebo/dexamethasone group.

In both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between the lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with a comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both groups, as was the number and type of prior therapies.

Pre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that lenalidomide/dexamethasone was statistically  significantly  superior  (p &lt; 0.00001)  to  dexamethasone  alone  for  the  primary  efficacy endpoint, TTP. Complete response (CR) and overall response (OR) rates in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm were also significantly higher than the dexamethasone/placebo arm in both studies. Results of these analyses subsequently led to an unblinding in both studies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dexamethasone group to receive treatment with the lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination.

In  a  pooled  follow-up  analysis  of  studies  MM-009  and  MM-010  (N  =  704),  the  median  TTP  was 48.3 weeks (95% CI: 41.1, 60.1) in patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone (n = 353) versus 20.1 weeks  (95%  CI:  19.9,  20.7)  in  patients  treated  with  placebo/dexamethasone  (n  =  351).  The median  time  of  progression  free  survival  (PFS)  was  47.3  weeks  (95%  CI:  36.9,  58.4)  in  patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone versus 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 18.1, 20.3) in patients treated with placebo/dexamethasone. The median  duration of treatment was 28.1 weeks  (min: 0.1, max: 110.7). Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and overall response (OR) rates in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm were significantly higher than in the dexamethasone/placebo arm in both studies. The overall survival (OS) in the pooled studies at one year after the start of treatment was 82%  in  patients  treated  with  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  versus  75%  in  patients  treated  with placebo/dexamethasone,  with  a  median  follow-up  duration  of  98.0  weeks  (min:  0.3,  max:  163.3). Despite  the  fact  that  170  out  of  the  351 patients  randomised  to  placebo/dexamethasone  received treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone after the studies were unblinded, the pooled analysis of OS  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  survival  advantage  for  lenalidomide/dexamethasone relative  to  placebo/dexamethasone  (hazard  ratio  =  0.75,  95%  CI  =  [0.59,  0.95],  p = 0.015).  Table 1 summarises key efficacy results of the pooled follow-up analyses of studies MM-009 and MM-010.

## Safety

In two Phase III, placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the lenalidomide/dexamethasone  combination  and  351  to  the  placebo/dexamethasone  combination.  The median  duration  of  exposure  to  study  treatment  was  significantly  longer  (44.0  weeks)  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lenalidomide/dexamethasone  group  as  compared  to  placebo/dexamethasone  (23.1  weeks).  The difference  was  accounted  for  by  a  lower  rate  of  discontinuation  from  study  treatment  due  to  lower progression of disease in patients exposed to lenalidomide/dexamethasone (39.7%) than in placebo/dexamethasone patients (70.4%).

Three hundred twenty-five (92%) of the patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group experienced at least one adverse reaction compared to 288 (82%) in the placebo/dexamethasone group.

The most serious adverse reactions were:

- Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (as stated in the SPC, section 4.4)
- Grade 4 neutropenia (as stated in the SPC, section 4.4).

The most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred significantly more frequently in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to the placebo/dexamethasone group were neutropenia (39.4%), fatigue (27.2%), asthenia (17.6%), constipation (23.5%), muscle cramp (20.1%), thrombocytopenia (18.4%), anaemia (17.0%), diarrhoea (14.2%) and rash (10.2%).

The adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in  order  of  decreasing  seriousness.  Frequencies  are  defined  as:  very  common  ( ≥ 1/10);  common ( ≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000, &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000 including  isolated  reports).  In  the  majority  of  cases,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the incidence of specific adverse events between the two treatment arms.

The  potential  teratogenicity  induced  by  lenalidomide  in  human  needs  further  investigation.  The combination with dexamethasone is also problematic since this drug possesses liver enzyme induction capacities,  which  might  affect  the  pregnancy  protection  with  anti-contraceptive  pills.  The  Risk Management Plan adequately addresses teratogenicity together with other safety concerns.

## Risk-benefit assessment

As  compared  to  dexamethasone  only,  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  induced  a  prolongation  of median TTP by roughly at least 28 weeks, a result that has been observed in both pivotal studies. Such an increased TTP might correspond to delayed symptoms and complications and appear as a clinical benefit as long as survival data do not contradict these results. Supplementary analyses do confirm that the benefit observed for TTP is also obtained with PFS.

Toxicities observed in studies of lenalidomide alone were low; the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower than those noted in trials using thalidomide. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were significant Grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed; however, it was manageable with dose reduction.

In contrast with high-dose dexamethasone, deep vein thrombosis has emerged as an important toxicity. An increase in deep vein thrombosis is indeed reported with lenalidomide, especially in patients who received  erythropoietin.  These  data  confirmed  that  the  use  of  erythropoietin  promotes  deep  vein thrombosis in patients with multiple myeloma (in Study MM-009 7.5% in the placebo/dexamethasone arm associated with erythropoietin versus 1%  without erythropoietin) but also showed  that lenalidomide increases this risk in these patients (overall 22.6% in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm associated with erythropoietin versus 4.8% without erythropoietin).

Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide cannot be ruled out.

The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential

Revlimid is contraindicated in case of:

- Women who are pregnant.
- Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met (as stated in the SPC, sections 4.4 and 4.6).
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  plus the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:
- o A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication to be sent at the time of launch with the following core message:
-  Approved indication of the medicinal product
-  Conditions of the Pregnancy  Prevention Programme  together  with  the definition  of  women  of  childbearing  potential  and  effective  contraceptive method, requirements of pregnancy testing and instruction for men patients
-  Awareness of risk of venous thromboembolism, myelosuppression, hypothyroidism and management in case of renal failure
-  Controlled distribution system implemented at a national level
- o Educational material for patient and healthcare professional includes:
-  A Healthcare Professional kit including information on lenalidomide licensed indication, description and management of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia,  thrombotic  risk,  use  in  hepatic  and  renal  impairment, description  of  the  Pregnancy  Prevention  Programme  with  the  definition  of women of childbearing potential and effective contraceptive method, requirements of pregnancy testing and reporting (pregnancy reporting form)
-  A  patient brochure with information on multiple myeloma, treatment instruction, pregnancy prevention programme and side effects
-  A patient card which includes documentation of childbearing potential status, acknowledgement  that  counselling  has  taken  place,  contraceptive  method used  for  women  of  childbearing  potential,  pregnancy  test  date  and  result, confirmation that there is no risk of pregnancy.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Revlimid  in  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  in combination  with  dexamethasone  in  patients  who  have  received  at  least  one  prior  therapy  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
