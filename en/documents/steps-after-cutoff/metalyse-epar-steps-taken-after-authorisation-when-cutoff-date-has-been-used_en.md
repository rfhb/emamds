## PROCEDURAL STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

For procedures finalised after 1 February 2004 please refer to module 8B.

- The MAH submitted an Urgent Safety Restriction on 14 November 2001 to introduce changes in the instructions for use and handling in the SPC and in the instructions for use detailed in the pictogram on the inner lid of the folding box, following a number of reports suggesting that the instructions for use of the product may not have been followed appropriately. In addition, the MAH informed treating physicians by means of a Dear Heath Care Professional letter and the EMEA  published  a  Public  Statement.  The  EPAR  was  updated  shortly  afterwards  as  a consequence of the changes to the MA. These changes are reflected in the SPC and labelling.

Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below:

| Scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Application number   | Type of modification 3   | Notification/ Opinion issued on 4   | Commission Decision Issued/amen ded on   |
