1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0032/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC based on data from the ongoing Study AP24534-07- 101 with a median duration of follow - up of approximately 48 months for the CP - CML patients and 3.6 months for the advanced phase Ph+ leukemia patients, as well as 48-month follow-up data from the ongoing Study AP24534-10-201 (PACE). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and to align the annexes with the latest QRD template v.10. An updated RMP version 15.3 was agreed during the procedure in order to include the 48-month follow up data from the phase 2 study (PACE), address the commitments made in the framework of the PSUR 4 assessment and update the educational materials in line with the changes to the SmPC. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the RMP to include one additional potential risk identified in the post-marketing setting, i.e. posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), for which data were included in the PSUR 5 (PSUSA/00010128/201512). | 15/12/2016 | 26/01/2017 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The risk of arterial occlusive events is likely to be dose- related. Consider reducing the dose of Iclusig to 15 mg for CP-CML patients who have achieved a major cytogenetic response taking the following factors into account in the individual patient assessment: cardiovascular risk, side effects of ponatinib therapy, time to cytogenetic response and BCR-ABL transcript levels. If dose reduction is undertaken, close monitoring of response is recommended. For more information on the results from studies AP24534- 07-101 and AP24534-10-201 (PACE) please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. |

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has submitted final study results for preclinical studies ARP590, ARP591, ARP592, ARP593, ARP593 on vascular occlusion mechanism and study ARP598 on 'Effects of Ponatinib and its Metabolites on In Vitro Kinase Activity and Cellular Viability' following commitments taken during Article 20 referral procedure (EMEA/H/C/002695/A-20/0003; EC | 26/05/2016   | 25/08/2016   | SmPC              | In a fertility study in male and female rats, female fertility parameters were reduced at dose levels corresponding to human clinical exposures. Evidence for pre- and post- implantation loss of embryos was reported in female rats and ponatinib may therefore impair female fertility. There were no effects on male rat fertility parameters. The clinical relevance of these findings on human fertility is unknown. In a two-year carcinogenicity study in male and female rats, oral administration of ponatinib at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day in males and at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day in females did not result in any tumorigenic effects. The 0.8 mg/kg/day dose in females resulted in a plasma exposure level generally lower or equivalent to the human exposure at the range of dose from 15 mg to 45 mg daily. A |

| II/0007   | Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC in order to reflect the new data from study 902650 investigating the potential toxicity of ponatinib in juvenile Sprague- Dawley rats. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 20/03/2014   | 18/09/2014 | SmPC | The new data from a toxicity study in juvenile Sprague- Dawley rats (study 902650) show that ponatinib administration resulted in deaths related to inflammatory effects at 3.0 mg/kg/day after 6 or 7 days of treatment. These deaths were attributed to an inflammatory process resulting in multiple organ failure. Decreases in body weight gain were evident at doses of ≥ 0.75 mg/kg/day during the pre-weaning and early post-weaning treatment phases, which recovered during a post-treatment phase from Day 35 to 63 pp. No other adverse changes in developmental parameters (vaginal opening, preputial separation or bone measurements) were observed. As a consequence of this new data, section 5.3 of the SmPC has |

| II/0002 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add a warning regarding the risk of developing arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients treated with Iclusig. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/11/2013 | 20/12/2013 | SmPC and PL | Review of data from clinical studies, including two ongoing studies (a phase I dose-finding study and a pivotal phase II study), showed a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients treated with Iclusig than was observed at the time of marketing authorisation. In the phase I study, follow-up data from September 2013 showed a rate of serious occlusive vascular events of 22% (18 out of 81 patients) while in the phase II study the rate was 13.8% (62 out of 449 patients). In addition, in a recently discontinued phase III study comparing Iclusig with imatinib, there was a higher number of occlusive vascular events reported in the Iclusig arm, although the data from this study are still preliminary. As a consequence, sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated in order to include recommendations not to use Iclusig in patients with a history of heart attack or stroke, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. The cardiovascular status of patients should be assessed and cardiovascular risk factors actively managed |

Hypertension should be controlled during treatment with Iclusig and healthcare professionals should consider interrupting treatment if hypertension is not controlled. Finally patients should be monitored for evidence of vascular occlusion or thromboembolism, and treatment should be interrupted immediately if this occurs. Finally, the terms retinal vein occlusion and visual impairment were included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   |
