## 1. Background information on the procedure

<!-- image -->

1.1. Submission of the dossier The applicant Pfizer Limited submitted on 21 July 2016 an application for a marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for LIFMIOR, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 - 'Generic of a Centrally authorised product'. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 January 2016. The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicant applied for the following indication: Rheumatoid arthritis LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. LIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. LIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. LIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. LIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. Psoriatic arthritis Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Lifmior is an identical product to Enbrel, which has been authorised in the EU since 3 February 2000. The applicant, Pfizer Limited, is also the current MAH for Enbrel. Lifmior is stated to be identical to Enbrel in all but invented name and packaging. Lifmior has all of the therapeutic indications for which Enbrel is currently approved, including treatment of: -Moderate-to-severe active RA in adults -Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years -PsA in adolescents from the age of 12 years -Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) in adolescents from the age of 12 years -Active and progressive PsA in adults -Severe active AS in adults -Severe nr-AxSpA in adults -Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults -Chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years. Lifmior will have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well as same pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths (for the 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection for paediatric use, 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, 25 mg and 50 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg pre-filled pen presentations) as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in the manufacturing process, manufacturers, or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for Lifmior that could lead to differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel. Etanercept belongs to the pharmacologic class of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors and is a bioengineered fusion protein incorporating 2 molecules of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p75 and the crystallizable fragment (Fc) component of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). This human recombinant product binds specifically to TNF-α and lymphotoxin alpha, inhibiting their interaction with cell surface receptors. The Applicant claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etanercept), and cross-reference is made to information submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of this application. No new data are therefore required for this application and none have been submitted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Lifmior and Enbrel (reference product) are identical products. Lifmior is intended to have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and excipients as well as the same pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in the manufacturing process, manufacturers or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for Lifmior that could lead to differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel. Lifmior will, in all respects, except for the invented name and packaging, be identical to the reference product Enbrel. 2.2.2. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality data in support of the Lifmior application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Enbrel dossier. All the quality data have been assessed for the Enbrel application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction The applicant already manufactures the same drug substance and drug product: the only difference is that this product will be branded Lifmior, whereas the approved product is branded Enbrel. Lifmior is intended to have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well as same pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths as the reference product, Enbrel. The applicant has supplied a short non-clinical overview which establishes that, given this situation, no new nonclinical information is required. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Etanercept is a human tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 FC fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. In accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP44447/00 entitled 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' ; proteins are exempted of ERA because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, no environmental risk assessment was provided. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

As the active substance in Lifmior is the same as in Enbrel, there is no requirement for the applicant to present data from non-clinical studies.

2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The application is considered acceptable regarding the non-clinical aspects. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction This application claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etanercept), and cross-reference is made to information submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of Lifmior. No new clinical data are therefore required and none have been submitted. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics No new clinical pharmacology data are required for this application and none have been submitted. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 2.4.4. Post marketing experience Cumulatively through 02 February 2016, it is estimated that 11,787 subjects have been exposed to etanercept (as Enbrel) either as monotherapy or in combination with comparators in Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials, and an additional 13,366 subjects have been exposed to etanercept (as Enbrel) either as monotherapy or in combination with comparators in Amgen-sponsored clinical trials. The overall safety profile of etanercept (as Enbrel) after more than 16 years of commercial experience in the EU continues to be favourable. This is supported by the most recent etanercept PSUR with no new significant safety concerns identified during the respective time interval. 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical aspects Etanercept is a widely used and well known active substance. Lifmior will be a duplicate authorisation for Enbrel and will therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It has been outlined that in clinical use Lifmior may be considered interchangeable with Enbrel. This is acknowledged by CHMP considering that Lifmior is identical to Enbrel. In a broader context there is however the issue of educating health care professionals, particularly pharmacists, that Lifmior and Enbrel are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identical bearing in mind that automatic substitution for biologicals is currently not allowed in certain EU countries. The applicants' strategy to whether Lifmior is planned to be presented to be substitutable and interchangeable for Enbrel remains unclear. In this respect it should be noted that introducing an identical biological product bears the risk of adding a level of potential confusion to the existing state of education of health care professionals with regard to the issue of interchangeability and substitution of biological medicinal products, particularly biosimilars.

Conclusion The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.2 is acceptable. 2.6. PSUR submission The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 2.8. Product information 2.8.1. User consultation No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Enbrel. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 2.8.2. Additional monitoring Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lifmior (etanercept) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is a biological product to be authorised after 1 January 2011. Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. Benefit-risk balance Medicinal product no longer authorised

The application contains no new quality, non-clinical and clinical data. Lifmior will except for the invented name and commercial packaging, in all respects, be identical to the reference product Enbrel and will therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

4. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of LIFMIOR is favourable in the following indication: 'Rheumatoid arthritis Lifmior in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. Lifmior can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Lifmior is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Lifmior, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. Lifmior has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. Psoriatic arthritis Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Lifmior has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. Axial spondyloarthritis Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

## Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

Plaque psoriasis Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). Paediatric plaque psoriasis Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.' The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).
