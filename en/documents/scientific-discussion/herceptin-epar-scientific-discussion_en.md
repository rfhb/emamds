## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Herceptin.  This  scientific discussion  has  been  updated  until  30  November  2004.  For  information  on  changes  after  this  date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Herceptin  contains the active substance  trastuzumab  (anti-p185,  rhuMab  HER2),  which  is  a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 protein. HER-2 is a transmembrane spanning receptor-like protein, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor and has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2 both in  vitro and in vivo .

Herceptin is presented as a white to pale yellow lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion.

Herceptin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumours overexpress HER2:

a) As monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.

b)  In  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable.

Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression at a 3+ level as determined by immunohistochemistry.

The  recommended  dosage  scheme  consists  of  a  trastuzumab  loading  (4mg/kg  body  weight)  and subsequent  weekly  doses  of  2-mg/kg  body  weights.  It  should  be  administered  until  progression  of disease.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Documents  were  filed  according  to  the  Notice  to  Applicants.  During  the  approval  procedure,  the applicant performed the validation of a new manufacturing site for the active substance at Genentech, Vacaville,  and  USA.  In  addition,  due  to  the  non  acceptance  of  the  submitted  multidose  finished product  formulation  which  originally  contained  benzyl  alcohol  after  reconstitution,  which  is  not  in compliance with the Ph. Eur. the applicant changed the manufacturing procedure, the fill size of the finished product and the manufacturing site of the finished product from Genentech, USA to Roche, Basel.

These changes resulted in a new set of data on the active substance and finished product provided with the response. A separate solvent is no longer part of the drug product.

The  manufacturing  sites  of  Vacaville  (active  substance)  and  of  Hoffman  La-Roche  Basel  (finished product) were inspected following a CPMP request and found in general compliance with EC-GMP (Inspection report is annexed to this assessment report).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Composition

Trastuzumab  is  formulated  as  a  lyophilised  powder  and  each  vial  is  designed  to  deliver  150  mg trastuzumab. The finished product also includes 3.36 mg L-Histidine HCl, 2.16 mg L-Histidine, 136.2 mg trehalose, dihydrate, and 0.6 mg polysorbate 20.

The  sterile  solution  is  filled  aseptically  into  15  ml  Type  I  borosilicate  glass  vials  with  20  mm lyophilised stoppers and lyophilised using validated methods. The lyophilised vial (finished product) is  reconstituted  with  7.2  ml  of  sterile  water  for  injections  (not  supplied)  to  yield  a  single-dose formulation at 21-mg/ml trastuzumab, at pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.

The  reconstituted  HERCEPTIN  is  a  colourless  to  pale  yellow  transparent  solution  and  should  be essentially free of visible particulates. The required volume is determined on the basis of a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab /kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight.  The  appropriate  amount  of  solution  should  be  withdrawn  from  the  vial  and  added  to  an infusion bag containing 250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

The single dose vial of 150 mg was used for clinical trials outside the US. However in the dossier originally submitted Herceptin was presented as a multidose formulation of 440 mg trastuzumab to be reconstituted with 20 ml of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol to yield a multi dose formulation at 21 mg/ml trastuzumab. As the use of preservative was contrary to the Ph. Eur. requirements  the  applicant  following  a  CPMP  request  changed  to  150  mg  single  dose  vials  to  be reconstituted with sterile water for injections without preservative.

## Product development and finished product

## Method of preparation

The  applicant  developed  a  new  final  dosage  form  to  obtain  150  mg  as  a  single  dose  preparation without  the  need  for  a  preservative  in  the  reconstitution  solution.  In  contrast  to  the  originally submitted dossier, filling and lyophilization is now performed at the Roche, Basel, and facility. With the response, the applicant provided data on three pilot scale batches of Herceptin 150 mg which were completed by a second response including data on the validation of the full-scale manufacture on three full-scale batches produced at manufacturing scale.

Trastuzumab bulk drug substance for storage is aseptically filled into 120 L stainless steel tanks at Vacaville, USA, during prefiltration and stored at ≤ -20 ° C prior to use. The manufacture of Herceptin starts at Roche, Basel, with thawing of bulk material, pooling of up to three bulk lots and aseptically filtration. After filling under aseptically conditions the material is lyophilised.

## Production and control of active substance.

Trastuzumab was generated by the immunisation of Balb/c mice with cells expressing HER-2 on their surface  and  partially  purified  membranes  containing  p 185 HER-2  according  to  standard  hybridoma techniques.

Hybridomas were either screened  by an ELISA utilising immobilised p 185 -HER-2 protein,  an  assay detecting  HER-2  mediated  growth  inhibition  of  SK-BR-3  cells  or  a  nude  mice  breast  cancer xenograph model, resulting in muMAb 4D5.

The  humanisation  of  muMAb 4D5  was  performed  according  to  standard  procedures  after  the determination  of  the  primary  sequence  of  the  VH+L  chain  regions  of  muMAb 4D5.The  resulting constructs were designed to express the human Fc γ 1 isotype to maximally support CDC and ADCC. The resulting antibody of the humanisation huMAb 4D5-8, which expressed maximal amount of the humanised  antibody,  is  reported  to  bind  to  ECD  of  HER-2  about  3-fold  more  tightly  than muMAb 4D5.

The active substance trastuzumab is produced in recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary cells using a serum free  medium. The  MCB, WCB and End of Production Cells were characterised sufficiently. MCB andWCB were adapted to growth in serum free medium.

Manufacturing process of the active ingredient starts with thawing and expansion  of cells from the MCB or the WCB derived from the MCB. Cells are expanded using a seed train and fermenters from 80 liters up to 12 000 liters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After harvesting different chromatographic steps are used for purification. With affinity chromatography (Protein A) unwanted protein and potential endotoxin contaminants can be removed. Cation  ion  exchange  chromatography  removes  antibody  aggregates  and  fragments  and  CHO impurities.  Anion  ion  exchange  chromatography  is  intended  to  separate  DNA,  endotoxin,  and retrovirus,  if  present.  With  hydrophobic  interaction  chromatography  antibody  aggregates,  fragments and  CHO proteins  can  be  removed.  After  formulation  and  filtration  into  freeze/thaw  stainless  steel tanks  the  formulated  bulk  can  be  stored  at  2-8 0 C  and/or  frozen  and  stored  at  -20 0 C  or  lower  until further processing to finished product takes place.

Process validation (active substance and finished product)

The critical steps of the manufacture of the finished product have been validated using pilot scale and full-scale  batches:  influence  of  the  mixing  parameters  during  pooling,  protein  yield,  homogeneity during  filling,  simulation  of  an  interruption  during  filling,  homogeneity  during  filling  tested  after lyophilization, homogeneity of drying, evaluation of the lyophilization cycle. In addition, adequate inprocess controls have been established and analysis of three full-scale finished product batches shows consistency of the manufacturing process. As a follow-up measure, the data on in-process and release controls for two further batches will be provided

For active substance, process validation studies were presented to demonstrate the removal of hostrelated DNA, Chinese Hamster ovary cell proteins (CHOP) and non-host-related impurities. Lifetime of purification columns and hold points during the purification process were validated.

Data from the validated release assays for five lots of bulk active ingredient produced at Vacaville were presented and compared to the ranges of these assays specified for trastuzumab.

Consistency of the drug substance was assessed using test methods and specifications as described in the MAA in section II.C.1.1

All  results  were  within  the  specification  limits  and  within  the  range  of  the  lots  produced  at  the previous site, South San Francisco.

Comparing  the  cell  culture  process  of  Vacaville  and  the  previous  manufacturing  site  assessed production culture performance.

All results were within the ranges of the results of the previous production. Recovery performance was assessed by comparing recovery yields of the Vacaville lots with the lots produced at the previous site and the yields of every production step were within the range of the known results. In-process controls for the Vacaville lots showed results within the specified limits.

Impurity profiles were obtained by testing for host cell proteins, host cell DNA, and residual Protein A at various intermediate stages in the process

All  results  were  within  the  ranges  of  the  lots  produced  at  the  previous  site.  Stability  studies  were performed after storage for 1 month at 37°C.

Changes observed were within the range of the changes of material manufactured at the previous site.

Further stability data are required as follow-up measure for the bulk product to reflect the anticipated storage time and conditions used during full production.

## Viral validation

Five production steps were investigated in order to demonstrate the virus safety of trastuzumab: (1) Protein A Chromatography, (2) incubation at low pH (&lt;3.7), (3) Cation exchange Chromatography, (4) Anion exchange Chromatography and (5) Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography.

Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MuLV), MVM, and SV40 were used for the validation studies. X-MuLV is a model for type A and C retroviruses, which contaminate the cell culture. It was used for the evaluation of all five steps. No other enveloped virus was utilised.

The  Protein  A  Chromatography  was  additionally  investigated  with  MVM  and  the  anion  exchange chromatography with MVM and SV40.

Although  the  virus  safety  of  trastuzumab  relies  especially  on  the  virus  removal  capacity  of  the chromatographic steps, three of the four chromatographies were only tested with one or two viruses.

Further data were provided for the Protein-A and anion exchange chromatographic steps in order to clarify  the  underlying  mechanism  for  the  removal  of  model  viruses  through  partitioning  and  to demonstrate the scaled-down conditions in relation to that of the production scale. Furthermore, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy  of  the  anion  exchange  column  to  remove  viruses  after  50  cycles  of  use  and  the  effect  of sanitization of columns onto virus inactivation have been shown adequately.

## Product characterisation

The  drug  substance  is  characterised  by  a  number  of  modern  analytical  techniques  to  determine chemical-physical and biological parameters.

For non-compendial methods validation data were presented. Trastuzumab manufactured either by the early development cell line, which was used in phase I and phase II clinical trials, or by the to-bemarketed cell line was compared intensively.

It was demonstrated that the drug substances manufactured with both processes are equivalent, except for  the  absence  of  the  polymorphism  at  heavy  chain  residue  376.  Primary  reference  material,  lot HER1097-3 is characterised by a number of tests.

For the previous manufacturing site, batch analysis data of bulk active ingredient of four qualification lots and 24 production lots were submitted. For the new manufacturing site, sufficient data obtained from manufacture of 5 batches of bulk active ingredient were submitted to demonstrate comparability of batches of bulk active ingredient produced at the previous and new sites.

The finished product is characterised by a number of validated control tests.

Comparability of the single dose vial versus multidose vial was demonstrated. Similarities were the same strength, filled from the same formulated bulk, same final product composition, and same glass quality. Differences: were stoppers laminated with a fluoro resin film instead of siliconized, new vial size, additional; sterile filtration, adjusted lyophilization cycle to the smaller vial size, Roche Basel site for filling and lyophilization.

One  lot  of  reference  material  has  been  manufactured  and  adequate  characterisation  data  were provided.

## Finished product testing

A  comprehensive  assay  control  system  was  developed  to  ensure  that  the  product  meets  rigorous standards  of  quality  and  batch-to-batch  consistency.  The  quality  control  of  recombinant  proteins requires a careful selection of multiple assays that are complementary for the evaluation of identity, purity, potency, strength, and stability. In the case of a recombinant protein such as trastuzumab, the degradation  pattern  is  complex  and  no  single  method  can  address  all  of  the  modes  of  degradation. Thus, a series of individual assays are used to detect subtle molecular changes. Testing for purity and molecular consistency in production of trastuzumab is primarily performed on the Bulk for Storage. This step in the process was chosen because, at this point, all protein purification operations have been completed, and one bulk, or part of it, may be combined with other bulks, or parts of other bulks, prior to production  of  the Final Vial.  Consideration  has  been  given  to molecular  characterisation information,  process  validation  results,  compendial  requirements,  and  assay  validation  results  in devising the control systems. The action limits and specifications are consistent with the manufacturing  history  and  clinical  experience.  Assay  validation  reports  for  the  non-compendial release tests for Bulk for Storage and Finished Product were provided and found adequate.

## Complete re-testing is performed at Roche, Grenzach, Germany.

During the approval procedure, samples of 3 batches of the finished product were tested experimentally at the laboratory of the Rapporteur. The results meet the finished product specification. There  were,  however,  some  methodological  issues  identified  on  the  potency  assays,  which  will  be clarified by submission of an updated, SOP as a follow-up measure.

## Stability of the active ingredient

Three  months  real  time  studies  were  performed  using  a  variety  of  storage  conditions  to  assess  the impact of performing freeze/thaw cycles, liquid storage at 2°C-8°C, and frozen storage at &lt; -20°C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While the data originally provided have been obtained for bulk active ingredient manufactured at the previous site, results of an ongoing study for the material produced at Vacaville will be provided as a follow-up measure in order to reflect the anticipated storage time and conditions used for bulk active ingredient produced at the new site.

## Stability of the finished product

Results of real time studies to determine the stability of Herceptin in the to-be-marketed configuration were provided with the application for the product produced at the sites of Genentech. Accordingly, the  drug  product  has  been  reconstituted  with  Bacteriostatic  Water  for  Injection,  containing  1.1 % benzyl alcohol. Stability was monitored at the recommended storage condition of 2° - 8°C as well as at 30°C.  Samples  were  tested  according  to  defined  protocols  and  assayed  using  stability-indicating methods.  In  addition,  studies  were  conducted  to  determine  the  effect  of  intense  light,  ambient temperature handling and shipping, handling and manipulation of reconstituted Herceptin for multiple uses,  as  well  as  to  assess  finished  product  stability  after  dilution  into  0.9%  sodium  chloride  or  5% dextrose  in  either  polyvinyl  chloride  or  polyolefin  IV  bags.  In  addition,  the  stability  of  the  and subsequently  stored  at  2° - 8°C,  was  examined.  The  results  of  these  studies  provided  adequate reassurance  on  the  stability  of  the  finished  product.  However,  since  the  manufacturing  site  and  the formulation  of  the  finished  product  have  been  changed  to  Basel  and  the  150  mg  single  dose, respectively, a new stability study was necessary to perform. Stability data of three pilot scale batches of 150 mg vials covering 6 months were provided. Supportive data were provided for 36 months from 150  mg  vials  manufactured  at  Genentech  for  clinical  trials.  As  a  follow-up  measure,  results  of  an ongoing study to demonstrate stability of full-scale finished product batches produced at Roche, Basel.

## · Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  first  list  of  questions  raised  4  major  objections  regarding  the  lack  of  data  about  the  intended manufacturing site, the use of a multi-dose formulation containing 1% benzylalcohol as preservative which  was  in  contrary  to  the  Ph.  Eur.  requirements,  the  need  of  further  information  on  the  assay performed to test potency and residual DNA content. As part of the response, the complete data on the viral  safety  of  the  manufacturing  procedure  were  submitted  for  the  first  time  since  originally  brief summarising  reports  were  only  available.  In  addition,  a  large  number  of  questions  and  points  for clarification was raised. A second list of question resulted from the assessment of the response of the applicant.  The  questions  were  mainly  related  to  issues  which  needed  further  clarification  on  the performance of the virus validation studies.

Five issues mainly resulting from the fact that the manufacturing sites for the active substance and the finished product were established newly and the final product dosage from were changed from multidose to single-dose were accepted to be handled as follow-up measures. These relate to the need of submitting updated stability results and to the need of updating the SOP of the potency assay.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Herceptin is directed against HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein), which is part of a family of membrane-bound phosphoglycoproteins with tyrosine kinase activity. HER2 is encoded by the proto-oncogene cerb B-2, the human homologue of the rat neu oncogene. The proteins coded by  the  oncogens,  the  oncoproteins,  are  all  involved  in  the  signalling  cascades  that  control  cell proliferation and differentiation.

The  principal  relationship  of  the  verbB2 oncogene  and  its  associated  protein  (the  receptor  for  a growth  factor)  with  cancer  concerns  overproduction  of  the  receptor  with  the  consequence  that  the affected  cell  becomes  unusually  sensitive  to  mitogenic  stimulation  by  normal  (small)  amounts  of growth factor. Overexpression of the endogenous receptor protein can occur by genomic amplification or  by  a  mutation  in  the  'protein-enhancer  control  region'  of  the  cellular  cerbB2 proto-oncogene, which can result in increased transcription and subsequently, increased protein formation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HER2 overexpression, observed in approximately 30% of human breast tumors, is a prognostic factor of poor survival.

## Pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

Trastuzumab  inhibited  proliferation  of  HER2  overexpressing  cells  and  induced  loss  of  intrinsic resistance of cells that overexpress HER2 to the cytotoxic effects of TNF α .

Furthermore, reduction in synthesis of cellular components affecting cell adhesion and the metastatic potential  of  tumour  cells  and  suppression  of  production  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  was observed upon treatment with trastuzumab.

Based on evidence from a variety of cell lines, antibody-coated cells are also susceptible to cytotoxic damage through binding with the Fc γ RIII (CD16) receptor on effector cells, NK cells and monocytes, but not neutrophiles.

Although trastuzumab has been shown to bind to HER2 on several breast adenocarcinoma cell lines and activate the complement cascade, no complement-mediated tumour-cell lysis occurred, probably due to the presence of regulatory proteins such as CD35, CD46 or CD55.

Treatment of cells overexpressing HER2 ( eg SK-BR-3, MCF7) with muMAb 4D5, the murine parent antibody, or trastuzumab significantly reduced the expression of the HER2 receptor in the cell surface (up to 50% over 5 days).

Although trastuzumab or muMAb 4D5 seem to increase tyrosine autophosphorylation, and cause other agonist effects that may have the potential to stimulate the growth of HER2 overexpressing tumour cells, downstream signalling pathways appear not to be affected.

In  cross-reactivity  studies  with  frozen  human  or  Cynomolgus  monkey's  tissues,  trastuzumab  and muMAb 4D5 showed similar patterns of immunoreactivity. They both were reactive in normal tissues with  membrane staining in a subset of epithelial cells including squamous epithelium of exocervix, skin,  esophagus,  urothelium  of  the  bladder  and  tonsil.  Epithelial  cells  of  different  organs  showed positive membrane staining in breast acinar and ductal cells, endocervical glands, esophageal glands, epithelial  cells  of  the  renal  tubules  and  epithelial  cells  lining  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  including pancreas and salivary glands.

The erbB2 receptor is currently being  cloned from cynomolgus monkey tissue.  Preliminary results (sequencing of one clone) at the DNA level indicate a very high degree of homology.  The nonlinear PK observed at lower doses of trastuzumab in monkey is consistent with specific, saturable binding. The tissue cross reactivity and nonclinical PK studies and the demonstrated specificity of muMAb4D5 for HER2, support the conclusion that Herceptin (trastuzumab, GN1450) recognised monkey HER2. High sequence homology of human ErbB2 with Macaque fasicularis, and compatible/parallel binding patterns in human and Macaque mulatta tissue screens will indicate monkey is a good tox species.

## In vivo studies

Pharmacodynamic effects  relating  to  the  proposed  indications  were  studied  in  nude  mouse  models, which have been transplanted with human breast tumour xenografts. The murine parent antibody of trastuzumab (muMAb 4D5) and cisplatin/carboplatin alone or in combination did interfere with tumor growth, leading to a greatly reduced tumour size in comparison to untreated animals. The combination muMAb 4D5 and cisplatin  did  not  lead  to  a  significant  improvement  over  one  of  the  components alone.

## Combination studies

Using both in-vitro and in-vivo approaches, the anti-tumour potential of trastuzumab in combination with  a  variety  of  established  therapeutic  agents  has  been  assessed  in  SK-BR-3,  HER2-transfected MCF7 and BT-474 cell lines. Synergistic effects were observed in cell culture with cisplatin, thiotepa and  etoposide  and  additive  interactions  with  doxorubicin,  paclitaxel,  methotrexate  and  vinblastine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Combinations with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide and vinblastine were most effective in vivo . The combination with paclitaxel produced the greatest tumour regression in vivo with the BT-474 cell line.

## Pharmacokinetics

Since trastuzumab is a humanised MAb, significant species differences in pharmacokinetics are to be expected:  rodent  p185 neu (corresponding  receptor  protein  to  human  p185 HER2 )  is  not  recognised, whereas  in  non-human  primates  trastuzumab  recognises  a  receptor  (as  yet  uncharacterised)  in epithelial  cells.  However,  unlike  humans  these  primate  species  do  not  overexpress  p185 HER2 or produce shed antigen.

Several studies on the pharmacokinetic profiles of trastuzumab after a single administration revealed a terminal  half-life  ranging  from  approx.  2,8  to  14 days  determined  in  mice,  rhesus  and  cynomolgus monkeys.

The presence of free extracellular domains (ECD) of HER-2 in the serum of cynomolgus resulted in an increased clearance and thus a shorter half life of trastuzumab.  ECD clearance was also decreased in  the  presence  of  trastuzumab  in  both  the  mouse  and  the  monkey  indicating  that  ECD  can  be maintained in circulation when complexed with trastuzumab..

In  single-dose  studies  in  mice  C max was  16.0,  250,  2250  µg/ml  for  the  doses  of  1,  10,  100  mg/kg respectively. The dose response in terms of Cmax or AUC in the rhesus monkey was non-linear, with a pattern of supraproprotional increases in AUC in relation to dose. The terminal half-life in the mouse (11-39 days) was considerably longer than that in the rhesus monkey (6 days for 0.5 mg/kg dose).

In repeated-dose studies in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys over 4-26 weeks involving doses of 1-25 mg/kg once or twice weekly, clearance was reasonably similar in all groups (0.17-0.33 ml/h/kg) with terminal half-lives ranging from 3 to 14 days.

However, non-linear kinetics were evidenced at doses approximately lower than 2 mg/kg, while dose independent (dose proportional) kinetics were obeyed above this dose.

The distribution and fate of 125 I-labelled trastuzumab were compared with those of similarly labelled huIgG1 in tumour-bearing beige-nude athymic mice. Through tissue and blood analysis, and wholebody  autoradiography,  it  was  shown  that  the  disposition  of  the  specific  (trasyuzumab)  and  nonspecific  IgG1  Abs  were  similar  in  blood  and  non-tumour  tissues.  On  the  other  hand  uptake  of radioactivity was localised in tumour tissue for 125 I-labelled trastuzumab and not IgG1, and was shown to be saturable. Peak tumour uptake occurred 24-48 hours after administration and ranged from 2266% dose/g of tissue.

The corresponding tumour-to-serum radioactivity ratios ranged from 1.07 to 4.34. Extrapolation of these  results  to  humans  is  compromised  by  the  fact  that  the  animals  used  do  not  express  human p185 HER2 on normal tissues.

A  study  was  undertaken  in  groups  of  female  rhesus  monkeys  to  investigate  kinetic  interactions between trastuzumab and a range of conventional anti-tumour drugs (Taxol, Adriamycin, Adriamycin/Cytoxan  combination).  The  kinetic  parameters  of  the  various  chemotherapeutics  were essentially  unaffected  by  the  presence  of  trastuzumab  and vice  versa ,  except  in  the  case  of  the combination with paclitaxel where the Cmax for trastuzumab was doubled and the clearance halved, terminal half-life being unaffected.

In intravenous embryo-fetal development studies in cynomolgus monkeys after repeated administration,  the  fetal  serum  levels  were  10-33%  of  the  respective  maternal  concentrations. Trastuzumab was detected in the milk of Cynomolgus monkeys and in their neonates.

## Toxicology

## Single Dose Toxicity

Single-dose acute studies were undertaken using iv bolus administration in mice (M+F) at 0, 9.4, 47 and 94 mg/kg and in rhesus monkeys (M+F) at 0, 4.7, 23.5 and 47 mg/kg. The absence of toxicity of several different preparations and formulations of trastuzumab could be demonstrated, as measured by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard parameters like food consumption, body weight, antibody formation, clinical chemistry and macro- and microscopic examination of standard organs/tissues.

The no-observable-effect-level (NOEL) was determined as 94 and 47 mg/kg in mice and monkeys, respectively.

## Repeated-Dose Toxicity

The repeated-dose toxicity evaluation of trastuzumab is based on a four-week study in rhesus monkeys and 12- and 26-week studies in cynomolgus monkeys.

In  all  three  studies  there  was  a  minimal  toxic  response,  with  the  only  noteworthy  observations concerning  injection-site  trauma  in  the  rhesus  monkey.  Neutralising  antibodies  were  detected  from weeks 5-26 in one low-dose female cynomolgus monkey.

This  represents  an  incidence  of  1/84  animals  in  repeated-dose  studies  in  which  antibodies  to trastuzumab were detected.

Death of a mid-dose female in the 26-week study (not considered treatment-related) was considered connected to presence of large thoracic mass found at necropsy.

A study of the administration of trastuzumab together with Taxol, Adriamycin, or Cytoxan/Adriamycin in rhesus monkeys did not elicit significant findings on parameters like mortality and clinical observations, body weights, electrocardiograms, clinical pathology including hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis.

## Reproduction Toxicity

Owing  to  the  lack  of  suitability  of  the  species  used  conventionally  (rat,  rabbit),  studies  were undertaken in the cynomolgus monkey.

| Reproductive function:     | No effects on menstrual cycles or sex hormone profiles   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Embryotoxicity:            | No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity   |
| Peri-/Post-natal toxicity: | No maternal, foetal or neonatal toxicity                 |

Although several mortalities occurred in treated pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, results of necropsies and  other  follow-up  studies  indicated  that  the  deaths  were  probably  unrelated  to  treatment,  being characteristic of mortalities commonly observed in cynomolgus monkey colonies.

Anti-trastuzumab antibodies The induction of antibodies against trastuzumab was a rare event in the monkeys. It is recognised that the sensitivity of the detection system of anti-trastuzumab antibodies could be compromised by the presence of trastuzumab in the serum samples of the monkeys.

## Mutagenic Potential

The genotoxic potential of trastuzumab has been investigated both in vitro and in vivo . In-vitro studies included Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium (strains  TA  98, 100, 1535 and 1537), E. coli assays (strains  WP2pKM101  and  WP2uvrApKM101),  and  a  chromosome  aberration  assay  in  human peripheral lymphocytes. Concentrations up to 5 mg/ml were employed in both assays. The in-vivo test was  a  mouse  micronucleus  assay  involving  single iv injection  of  trastuzumab  at  29.5,  59  and  118 mg/kg. All tests gave clearly negative results.

## Local tolerance

No local irritation was observed when trastuzumab and trastuzumab excipient were given by single bolus iv injection into the rabbit ear vein.

## Cardiotoxicity

Preclinical studies have been undertaken in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism for the enhanced cardiotoxicity observed in some clinical-trial patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with an anthracycline-based cytotoxic such as doxorubicin.

Tissue  cross  reactivity  studies  with  trastuzumab  in  monkey  and  human  tissue  did  not  reveal localisation to heart tissue.

Single-dose  studies  in  rhesus  monkeys  with  the  trastuzumab-doxorubicin  combination  (both  at  1.5 mg/kg) had previously shown no evidence for cardiac effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Enhanced  cardiotoxicity  was  not  observed  in  a  rat  model  of  doxorubicin  cardiotoxicity  following addition of a surrogate antibody specific for rat c-erbB2. Potential models of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity  in  mice  and  dogs  using  trastuzamab  were  unsuitable  due  to  species  specificity  of trastuzumab and in consideration of potential immunogenic responses to a humanised protein. Possible anthracycline models in the monkey  were considered unsuitable based on ill-defined dose requirements to produce cardiotoxicity.

## Discussion

The  toxico-pharmacological  properties  of  trastuzumab  were  thoroughly  examined  in  Part  III  of  the dossier, which comprises more than 50 studies, of which the large majority was of very good quality. All  preclinical  safety  studies  appeared  to  be  well  designed,  and  conducted  in  concordance  with appropriate guidelines and in compliance with GLP.

The list  of  questions  included  different  topics  as  i.e.  Adriamycin-induced  cardiotoxicity,  affinity  of Herceptin for monkey's HER-2, activation of breast cancer cells into invasiveness, signal transduction, formation  of  anti-trastuzumab  antibodies,  xenograft  models  and  technical  questions.  The  questions were  either  answered  by  the  submission  of  additional  documentation  in  the  form  of  literature, references within the dossier, re-evaluation of data or by submission of new data. All but one of the answers was considered acceptable. Further mechanistic studies on the mode of action and impact of trastuzumab  on  the  enhanced  cardiotoxicity  are  being  performed  for  which  the  results  will  be submitted on an ongoing basis.

SPC  sections  relevant  to  preclinical  data  (particularly  Sections  4.6,  and  5.3)  were  discussed  and changed during the procedure.

## 4. Clinical aspects

HER-2  over-expression  has  been  linked  with  a  poorer  outcome  in  patients  with  breast  cancer. Consequently,  HER-2  over-expressing  breast  cancer  presents  an  ideal  opportunity  to  exploit  the concept  of  'targeted'  cancer  therapy.  A  strategy  to  antagonise  the  abnormal  function  of  overexpressed HER-2 was therefore developed. Murine monoclonal antibodies were produced against the extracellular domain of the HER-2 protein. One such antibody (muMAb 4D5) was found to markedly inhibit  the  proliferation  of  human  tumour  cells  over-expressing  HER-2.  This  effect  was  mediated through the binding of muMAb 4D5 to the HER-2 receptor. Efficacy was observed in non-clinical in vivo studies using the antibody alone, and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy .

Since  chronic  administration  of  murine  monoclonal  antibodies  to  humans  is  limited  by  immune responses to the non-human protein, the antibody was 'humanised' (i.e. the regions of muMAb 4D5 that determine anti-HER-2 binding specificity were engineered into the framework of a generic human antibody.  The  resulting  antibody,  rhuMAb HER-2  (trastuzumab),  binds  specifically  to  the  HER-2 protein extracellular domain with high affinity.

## Clinical Pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

No  studies  investigating  pharmacodynamics  were  performed  in  humans.  However,  activity  against human tumours has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo xenograft models.

Trastuzumab  inhibits  HER-2  expressing  human  tumour  cell  proliferation  and  mediates  ADCC (FC γ RIII)  against  such  tumours in  vitro. Toxicity  in  HER-2  over-expressing  tumour  cells  was increased compared to tumour cells, which express intermediate or low levels of HER-2.

As  a  follow-up  measure,  the  company  will  collect  data  on  HER2  expression  as  compared  to  the primary tumour in approximately 100 samples of metastatic sites.

## Pharmacokinetics

Non-linear pharmacokinetics was found in patients with MBC. A mean half-life of 5.8 days was seen following  a  loading  dose  of  4  mg/kg  with  a  weekly  maintenance  dose  of  2  mg/kg  of  Herceptin. Between the 16 th and 32 nd week serum concentrations reached a steady state with mean trough levels of 79 µ g/ml and peak concentrations of 123 µ g/ml. Saturation trough level has been determined at 20 ug/ml.  Baseline  shed  antigen  (the  circulating  extracellular  domain  of  HER2)  could  be  detected  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approx. 64% of the patients, median levels were 11 ng/ml. With some exceptions, mean trough levels at  weeks 7 and 8 were higher in complete (70.3 ug/ml) and partial (58.4 ug/ml) responders than in nonresponders (44.3 ug/ml).

No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Pharmacokinetic data from the phase  II/III  studies  showed  that  concurrent  administration  of  the  anthracyclines  doxorubicin  or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), or of cisplatin did not alter half-life, clearance, or exposure of Herceptin compared to the administration of Herceptin as a single agent. However, patients receiving paclitaxel had on average about 30% higher exposure to Herceptin than those receiving Herceptin in combination  with  AC.  This  observation  is  consistent  with  primate  studies,  which  showed  that administration of Herceptin with paclitaxel resulted in a reduction in Herceptin clearance. According to the applicant, it was unlikely that this difference would have clinical consequences, and so no dose adjustment was deemed necessary.

Pharmacokinetic  data  from  the  H0649g  single-agent  study  were  analysed  by  a  number  of  baseline characteristics.  There  was  no  apparent  relationship  between  age,  or  renal  function  (baseline  serum creatinine) and PK parameters but heavier patients tended to have higher trough concentrations. The clinical significance of this is unclear.

## Clinical Efficacy

'The  clinical  trials  were  performed  according  to  GCP  standards  and  agreed  international  ethical principles '

## Dose-finding studies and Main Clinical studies

## Dose response studies

In phase I studies, patients were treated with fixed doses (10 mg to 500mg). In order to achieve the targeted  serum  concentration  more  quickly,  a  loading  dose  was  introduced  in  phase  II  (250mg) followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of  100mg  weekly.  These  studies  confirmed  that  the  majority  of patients treated at this dose would attain trough concentrations above the targeted minimum. Further analyses suggested that clinical efficacy might be achieved more consistently by adjusting the dose by body weight. A trend towards clinical response in patients receiving doses between 1.6-1.9mg/kg was identified in this phase II data. A body-weight adjusted dose of 2mg/kg was, therefore, selected as a maintenance dose in phase III to ensure that patients received a dose that had been associated with clinical response in phase II. Since no significant tolerability problems had occurred with the loading dose in phase II, the concept of a loading dose was continued and was set at double the maintenance dose i.e. 4mg/kg. PK parameters were roughly similar from phase I to III although direct comparisons are difficult due to the change in dosing strategy from fixed to body-weight adjusted doses.

In  vitro  studies  with  SK-BR-3  cells,  a  HER-2  overexpressing  human  breast  cancer  cell  line, demonstrated  that  muMAb  4D5  (the  murine  parent  of  trastuzumab)  was  cytostatic  (not  cytotoxic). Thus,  in  order  to  treat  patients  more  effectively,  chronic  treatment  or  treatment  until  disease progression was necessary.

## Efficacy

The  two  Phase  III  studies  submitted  for  approval  consisted  of  the  HO648g  pivotal  study,  which assessed first line treatment in 469 women at 120 sites in 12 countries and the HO649g study, which evaluated second line treatment in 222 women at 55 sites in 7 countries. Both studies were conducted as open trials.

Herceptin as a single agent in second or third-line therapy

## Study III HO649g

This non-comparative, open-label Phase study encompassing 55 centres in 7 countries with a total ITT population  of  222  patients  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  response  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cancer  overexpressing  HER2,  who  had  relapsed  after  one  or  two  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  regimens and were then treated with Herceptin as a single agent, in second or third line therapy.

The  primary  endpoints  were  overall  (complete  and  partial)  response  rate  and  the  safety  profile  of Herceptin. The secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), 1-year-survival estimates, time to disease progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTTF) and quality of life (QOL) assessment.

Patients recruited had the characteristics of a poor prognostic group in which  any further chemotherapy would be expected to be associated with a low response rate:

- -presence of metastatic breast cancer that was HER2-positive (22% with 2+ and 78% 3+)
- -68%  of  patients  enrolled  in  this  study  had  failed  two  chemotherapy  regimens  for  metastatic disease,
- -65% had adjuvant chemotherapy
- -in 94% of the patients, prior failed-chemotherapy had included anthracycline
- -in 50% of the patients the prior chemotherapy regimens also included a taxane
- -a quarter of the patients had failed high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue
- -as compared to the general population of patients with breast cancer, these patients were much younger (mean age 50 years)
- -they were more likely to have hormone receptor-negative disease (55%)
- -they  were  more  likely  to  have  a  short  disease-free  interval  between  the  diagnosis  of  primary breast cancer and discovery of metastatic disease (37% had disease-free interval of 12 months or less)
- -70%  of patients had visceral metastases that are generally much  less responsive to chemotherapies and hormonal therapies commonly used to treat breast cancer.

*Cut-off April 99

Despite the large degree of previous treatments, 15% of patients had objective and durable (median 9.1 months) responses to Herceptin. The clinical significance of the objective tumour responses in this group  of  patients  was  supported  by  the  quality-of-life  and  survival  data.  Responders  (complete  or partial  response,  as  assessed  by  the  REC),  but  not  non-responders,  had  clinically  meaningful

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improvements in physical function, role function, social function, global quality of life, and fatigue scale scores during Herceptin treatment. Most responders were still alive at data cut off (28/34; 82%). In addition, 36% of patients had a minor response or stable disease. These included 20 patients (9%) in whom the disease was stable  for ≥ 6  months.  Major  responses  were  seen  not  only  in  patients  with disease limited to chest wall, distal lymph node and/or bone, but also in patients with visceral disease. Furthermore, the tolerability of Herceptin as compared to other options was far better and quality of life parameters were clinically improved.

## b) Herceptin in combination therapy with paclitaxel

The  pivotal  Phase  III  HO648g  study  encompassing  120  sites  in  12  countries  with  a  total  of  469 patients, the first of which were enrolled on 12 th June 1995, the last patient was enrolled on 7 th March 1997, was performed as a randomised, controlled, open-label trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of Herceptin combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who have tumours that overexpress HER2.

The chemotherapy regimen for both treatment groups was either anthracycline + cyclophosphamide (AC) or paclitaxel. Patients who had not received anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting were stratified to receive AC. Patients who had received any anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting were  stratified  to  receive  paclitaxel.  Upon  documented  disease  progression  (confirmed  by  an independent response evaluation committee), patients were entered into the extension study H0659g, in which they could receive either Herceptin alone or in combination with chemotherapy of choice.

Four different treatment arms were created, that was derived from two different pre-treatment groups and was later combined for statistical  purposes.  The  extent  of  the  patient's  previous  treatment,  esp. prior  chemotherapy,  is  considered  the  single  most  important  factor  for  a  response  to  subsequent chemotherapy.

However, the pre-treated patients were equally distributed between the Herceptin + paclitaxel and the paclitaxel-alone group.

The  primary  endpoints  were  TTP  (time  to  progression)  and  the  safety  profile  of  Herceptin.  The secondary  endpoints  encompassed  OR  (overall  response  rates),  DOR  (duration  of  response),  QOL (quality  of  life),  one-year  survival,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  Herceptin,  when  co-administered  with chemotherapy and the TTTF (time to treatment failure).

AC was chosen as an acceptable standard first-line chemotherapy regimen at the time the trial started (the  taxanes  had  not  yet  been  approved  for  use  in  breast  cancer).  However,  since  prior  adjuvant therapy with AC was an exclusion criterion for safety reasons, many patients were ineligible to enter the study. Prior anthracycline-based therapy was allowed by introducing a stratum in which patients who  had  previously  received  anthracycline  treatment  could  be  randomised  to  receive  paclitaxel  as chemotherapy with or without Herceptin. Paclitaxel was selected because it had become widely used for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  resistant  to  anthracycline-based  therapy. This meant, in effect, that two studies with differing populations were run side by side, and for this reason the data were analysed separately for each chemotherapy stratum (AC or paclitaxel) and only those of the paclitaxel arm were taken into account for the decision on the requested indication. In addition,  at  the  same  time,  the  original  double  blind  design  of  study  H0648  was  abandoned  due  to ethical considerations. As a result, the phase III trials were open studies.

The final assessment of the responses and the conclusion on the benefit-risk profile of Herceptin was only related to the paclitaxel data.

## Quality of life assessment (QOL)

The questionnaire used in the Herceptin trials was developed by the EORTC and evaluates physical function, global QOL, social function, and fatigue scales. The assessments were performed at baseline, 8 weeks, 20 weeks and 32 weeks after the start of the therapy regimen. There were no statistically significant differences in the quality of life scores between the two groups; a slightly more favourable trend was seen towards the 32 nd week in the Herceptin + chemotherapy group with higher scores in global QOL and less increase in fatigue compared to chemotherapy alone.

Efficacy was shown with respect to all the primary and secondary endpoints in the overall population and in the chemotherapy subgroups. Study H0648g  showed  that addition of Herceptin to chemotherapy:

- -prolongs  progression-free  survival  by  three  months  (TTP;  7.4  vs  4.6  months;  61%  increase; p=0.0001), compared to chemotherapy
- -this  benefit  of  Herceptin  treatment  was  statistically  significant  whether  given  in  combination with paclitaxel or anthracyclines
- -increases tumour response rate (50% vs 32%, p&lt;0.0001)
- -increases duration of response (9.1 vs 6.1 months, p=0.0002) in combination with chemotherapy Sites of progression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After Herceptin and paclitaxel therapy for metastatic breast cancer in patients in the pivotal trial the following sites of disease progression were found:

| Site*       |   H+P (N=87) % |   P Alone (N=92) % | p-value   |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Any site    |           70.1 |               95.7 |           |

*Patients may have had multiple sites of disease progression

The  frequency  of  progression  in  the  liver  was  significantly  reduced  in  patients  treated  with  the combination  of  Herceptin  and  paclitaxel.  More  patients  treated  with  Herceptin  and  paclitaxel progressed  in  the  central  nervous  system  than  those  treated  with  paclitaxel  alone.  This  issue  is adequately addressed in the SPC.

## Other clinical studies

## Phase I studies

The Phase I studies (HO407g, HO452g and HO453g) were neither designed to evaluate efficacy, nor were  they  in  support  of  the  indication.  However,  response  rates  were  recorded.  For  study  HO407g stable  disease  was  seen  in  9/16  patients  and  progressive  disease  in  7/16  patients.  In  study  HO452g 1/16 patient had a minor response, 5/16 showed stable disease and 10/16 had progressive disease. Of the 4 patients who then entered the maintenance phase, 3-showed progressive disease and 1 had stable disease after another 77 days on therapy. In the HO453g study, 4/16 had a partial response (2 in the 250  mg  group  and  2  in  the  500  mg  group),  6/16  showed  stable  disease  and  5/16  had  progressive disease. The 4 patients who had a partial response, all had 3+ HER2 overexpression. Of the 4 patients who  entered  the  maintenance  phase,  1  showed  progressive  disease  and  2  had  stable  disease  and  1 patient had a complete response and remains disease free 3 years after March 1996. For more detailed information on the Phase I studies see Annex.

## Phase II studies

Both Phase II studies (HO551g, HO552g) had efficacy as their objective, however only HO551g is in support of the indication, as HO552g combined Herceptin with cisplatin.

## HO551g:

In  this  study  the  overall  response  (OR)  of  the  main  study  and  maintenance  program  combined was 11.6%  (5/43  patients,  whereby  1  patient  had  a  complete  response).  The  mean  DOR  for  the  5 responders was 9 months (median 6.6 months). By study cut-off date (March 96) 34/46 patients had died.  Median  survival  of  all  enrolled  patients  was  14  months  (censored  by  data  cut-off).  Of  the  12 patients censored for survival at the time of data analysis 11 patients had survival times &gt; 14 months and 1 patient had died.

The Karnofsky score showed an improvement in 7.3% of the patients, 66 % of the patients maintained their baseline score and 26.8% deteriorated. Weight loss (&gt; 10% of their baseline weight) occurred in 4.4% of the patients.

## HO552g:

The partial response of the main study and maintenance program combined (evaluable patients = 37) was  24%  (9/37),  minor  response  and  stable  disease  were  also  24%  and  progressive  disease  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

registered in 51% of the patients. According to REC evaluation there were no complete responses on this study. The median TTP for all evaluable patients was 2.6 months. The median DOR was 5 months (range: 2 -18 months) for the 9 partial responses. By study cut-off date (March 96) 30 patients had died (29 due to MBC, 1 patient due to cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure, on 1 patient no information is available). Of the 23% of patients that were alive and censored for survival, the median survival time was 11 months.

The Karnofsky score showed an improvement in 5% of the patients, 49% maintained their baseline score  and  46%  deteriorated.  Weight  loss  (&gt;  10%  of  their  baseline  weight)  occurred  in  10%  of  the patients.

## H0650g

Multinational, randomised, single blind study of Herceptin in patients with HER2 overexpression who have not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

114 patients from 18 sites were enrolled. Patients had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. These patients did not wish to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy for MBC. Half of them had received prior adjuvant anthracycline, half had not. 59 patients were randomised to a low-dose group (2mg/kg weekly after 4 mg/kg loading dose), and 55 patients were randomised to a high-dose group (4mg/kg weekly after an 8 mg/kg loading dose). Approximately, half of the patients in this study had relapsed after receiving prior anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy.

The overall response rate was 26%. Forty-three (38%) patients showed clinical benefit as defined by stable disease or minor, partial, complete response for greater than 6 months. The response rate in the Her2 3+ population was 34%. Responses were seen in all sites of disease, including visceral disease. Sixty-four  percent  of  the  responders  had  received  adjuvant  anthracycline.  Overall,  79%  of  the responders had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy.

For the subgroup of patients who had 3+ HER2 overexpression by IHC, the overall response rate was 34%. This response rate in this first-line metastatic patient population compares quite favourably to the first-line metastatic patient populations in the H 0648g study, 17% response rate in the paclitaxel group  (received  prior  anthracycline  in  the  adjuvant  setting)  and  the  42  %  response  rate  in  the  AC group (no prior anthracycline).

## Response* Rates in Study H0650g (ITT population)

|              |   N | Overall response rate [95%CI]   |
|--------------|-----|---------------------------------|
| All patients | 114 | 30 (26%) [18.2% - 34.4%]        |
| 3+           |  87 | 30 (34%)                        |
| 2+           |  27 | 0 (0%)                          |

*Response criteria were as defined as in studies H0648g and H0649g.

The study was considered only relevant for safety considerations. The protocol is not applicable for efficacy  evaluation  since  it  was  a  non-controlled  study  and  no  standard  regimen  was  used  for  the treatment  of  MBC.  However,  an  important  finding  was  that  only  patients  with  3+  overexpressing tumours responded whereas patients with 2+ expressing tumours did not respond. Although the higher dosage regimen shows a slight trend for enhanced efficacy as compared to the lower dosage regimen, the  adverse  reactions  occur  with  higher  percentage  in  the  higher  dosage  group  indicating  a  dose response  relationship  for  adverse  events.  In  particular,  rash,  back  pain,  dyspnoea,  chills  and  fever occurred at a higher frequency in the high dose group.

## Clinical Safety

The  entire  clinical  database  based  on  the  clinical  trials  included  safety  data  for  over  nine  hundred patients receiving Herceptin in combination with numerous chemotherapy agents or as monotherapy. In  addition,  cumulative  data  exposure  since  marketing  approval  in  USA,  Canada,  Switzerland  and Israel as estimated to be worldwide about 25,000 patients has been taken into consideration for safety assessment. Thus, the applicant provided two PSURs during the approval procedure in addition to the data submitted with the application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While  in  the  clinical  trial  programme  the  main  safety  issue  was  identified  as  cardiotoxicity  of Herceptin, during the approval procedure additional issues arose, infusion related reactions including some  with  a  fatal  outcome,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  fatal  anaphylaxis  and  pulmonary events including adult respiratory distress syndrome and death. While some of these serious adverse events were observed in clinical trials, some of the events reported in the postmarketing setting were more severe. Thus, the originally suggested SPC needed to be completely amended according to the newly arising issues.

## Safety in clinical trials

All  patients  who  received  treatment  on  study  were  evaluable  for  safety.  Patients  who  received Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  (study  H0648g)  or  Herceptin  alone  (study  H0649g)  were  evaluated  for safety  weekly  with  each  infusion.  In  contrast,  patients  who  received  chemotherapy  alone  (study H0648g)  were  evaluated  less  frequently.  In  study  H0648g,  patients  were  followed  for  safety  until progressive  disease.  In  the  single-agent  study  H0649g,  patients  were  followed  for  safety  until discontinuation of Herceptin therapy.

Herceptin in Combination with Chemotherapy: Study H0648g

469 patients were enrolled into study H0648g, and 464 patients were evaluable for safety (five patients discontinued  the  study  prior  to  treatment  with  Herceptin  or  chemotherapy).  234  patients  received Herceptin.

The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  greater  in  the  paclitaxel  alone  subgroup  than  in  the Herceptin  +  paclitaxel  subgroup.  Few  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  &gt;2.5%  of  patients.  The incidence of many adverse events was increased among patients receiving Herceptin.

I nfusion-associated signs and symptoms: In this study, fever, chills, nausea, pain at the tumor site, vomiting, headache, back pain, and dizziness in association with Herceptin infusion occurred in 25% of patients.

Cardiovascular: see below under separate chapter.

Infection: There was an increased incidence of adverse events that mapped to the preferred term of infection  in  both  the  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  chemotherapy alone treatment group. Most of these events could be grouped into two categories: upper respiratory tract infection (cold, upper respiratory infection, etc.), which constituted 72% of events, and catheter infections,  which  constituted  9%  of  events.  The  imbalance  in  the  incidence  of  catheter-related infections  among  Herceptin-treated  patients  may  be  due  to  the  increased  frequency  of  indwelling catheter access with weekly Herceptin infusions.

Leukopenia and anemia: The incidence of mild leukopenia and anemia reported as an adverse event was increased with Herceptin treatment (leukopenia 41% vs 26%: anaemia 27% vs 19%).

Digestive: An  increase  in  a  number  of  adverse  events,  including  diarrhea  and  nausea  and  vomiting was  noted  in  both  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  treatment  groups.  The  events  were  mostly  mild  to moderate in severity.

Respiratory: An  increased  incidence  of  dyspnoea  and  cough  in  the  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy treatment groups occurred.

Occurrence of leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome: see below under separate chapter .

Other adverse events: A number of other adverse events of uncertain relationship were increased in incidence with Herceptin treatment which were adequately addressed in the SPC.

Laboratory Parameters: Routine hematology and serum chemistries were analyzed at baseline and at scheduled  intervals  at  a  core  laboratory  facility.  Modest  changes  were  noted  in  the  incidence  of neutropenia, anemia, and abnormal liver function test results.

Hematological  Laboratory  Parameters:  Hematologic  adverse  events  were  transient  and  occurred during the period of chemotherapy administration. Improvement was noted at week 20, and by week 32,  hematologic  values  were  nearly  back  to  baseline.  Median  hemoglobin  values  dropped  during chemotherapy  administration  (ie:  from  baseline  to  week  8  (-2.6g/dL)  and  week  20  (-2.4g/dL)  but were  close  to  baseline  levels  by  week  32  (change  from  baseline  -1.0g/dL)  when  patients  were  no longer receiving chemotherapy. Median absolute neutrophil counts did not vary markedly during the study. The incidence of WHO grade 3 and 4 abnormalities in haemoglobin levels was higher in the Herceptin + chemotherapy groups than in the chemotherapy alone groups (7% vs 1%). Grade 3 or 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neutropenia was observed more in the Herceptin + paclitaxel group than the paclitaxel alone group, which probably reflects the greater exposure to chemotherapy in the Herceptin-treated patients. Hepatic and Renal Laboratory Parameters: Overall, Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were infrequent. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities were observed less frequently among patients receiving Herceptin + chemotherapy than among patients receiving chemotherapy alone. No patient experienced Grade 3 or 4 elevations in laboratory tests measuring renal function (BUN and creatinine). Antibodies: No patients enrolled in study H0648g developed antibodies against Herceptin.

## Herceptin as a Single Agent - Study H0649g

A total of 213 patients were treated and evaluable for safety (received at least one dose of Herceptin) in  study  H0649g. Patients were to receive weekly 2mg/kg infusions up to first disease progression. Following first disease progression, patients could continue to receive weekly Herceptin infusions of 2mg/kg or could have their dose increased to 4mg/kg.

Overall, 77 patients received the higher dose (4 mg/kg IV weekly) of Herceptin either as a single agent or with systemic anti-cancer therapy. Nearly all of these patients reported at least one adverse event during treatment with the higher dose (97%; 75/77), while about a third experienced adverse events considered severe (36%; 28/77). Similar types of events occurred during treatment at the higher dose as those seen prior to first disease progression when patients (with few exceptions) were treated with the lower, 2mg/kg Herceptin dose. The following events commonly occurred (&gt;10% incidence) during high dose Herceptin treatment: dyspepsia, anemia, leukopenia, bone pain, myasthenia, depression and paraesthesia.

In general, the adverse events did not substantially differ as compared to study HO648g. One patient had a positive, neutralising antibody to Herceptin. This patient had received nine weekly infusions of Herceptin and had discontinued the study on day 67 due to progressive disease. This finding was not associated with any clinical symptoms.

## Cardiotoxicity

A main safety concern was cardiotoxicity (cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure, CHF). The original dossier contained a retrospective analysis of cardiac adverse events, which was made by a cardiac review and evaluation committee (CREC). For this analysis, the clinical data were searched for patients with cardiac-related AEs using specific criteria for symptoms of heart failure. A full reassessment  of  cardiac-related  events  was  performed  on  using  more  broader  search  criteria.  The findings were largely in accordance with those of the original CREC evaluation. The data provided by the applicant as part of the response confirmed that during the clinical studies cardiotoxicity was not prospectively  measured  as  an  adverse  event  and  that  any  data  only  allow  retrospective  analysis. Therefore,  the  cardiotoxic  potential  of  Herceptin  alone  or  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  in particular  with  paclitaxel,  demands  explicit  clarification  with  regard  to  symptoms  and  nature  of cardiotoxicity, frequency, mechanism, threshold of toxicity, time and dose response relationship, risk factors  other  than  age,  major  confounding  factors,  mechanism  of  interaction  between  Herceptin toxicity and chemotherapy toxicity. These data will be submitted through a follow-up measure.

## Symptoms, nature, and frequency of cardiotoxicity

Heart  failure  (New  York  Heart  Association  [NYHA]  class  II-IV)  has  been  observed  in  patients receiving Herceptin therapy alone or in combination  with paclitaxel following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be moderate to severe and has been associated  with  death.  These  symptoms  are  apparently  very  similar  to  anthracycline  induced cardiotoxicity.

Since broader search criteria were used, new events have been found, and others have been classified differently after review.

Categories are  mutually  exclusive: patients  assigned  in  hierarchical  fashion  according  to  ranking  in Table.

- a preferred terms: congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, left ventricular failure, lung edema

or other search terms and CRF information indicating cardiac failure (eg. a combination of shortness of breath, dyspnoea, cough increased, pulmonary congestion on X-ray, echo or MUGA findings)

- b cardiac  condition  most  likely  not  related  to  Adriamycin  toxicity  (eg.  pericardial  tamponade, syncope, stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ascites)
- c Includes preferred terms: cardiovascular disorder, shock, respiratory failure, respiratory distress, hypoxia, asthma, dyspnoea, cough increased, edema, peripheral edema, heart arrest, hypotension, palpitation, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia which are not further specified in the text of the adverse event forms in the CRF as being definitely related to malignant disease. Any other events with insufficient information for assessment of aetiology

(-) signifies that the difference is in the opposite direction ie the control group has a higher incidence than the Herceptin group.

The  events  identified  as  having  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  receiving  Herceptin  treatment,  in particular  in  combination  with  anthracycline/cyclophosphamide,  were events  related  to  heart  failure and were typical of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

The rate of symptomatic heart failure in the re-evaluation was not significantly different for Herceptin in  combination  with  paclitaxel  (7  patients,  7.7%)  from  that  for  paclitaxel  alone  (4  patients,  4.2%) (p=0.314  for  the  difference).  In  contrast,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  patients  treated  with Herceptin in combination with anthracycline compared with anthracycline alone (35 patients, 24.5% vs 10 patients, 7.4%; p&lt;0.001). The rate of symptomatic heart failure associated with monotherapy in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study H0649g was 6.6% (14 patients). Notably, 13 of the 14 patients with heart failure had received prior anthracycline.

The  incidence of cardiac events not typical of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity was  not significantly increased with Herceptin treatment in combination with either anthracycline or paclitaxel when compared with either chemotherapy alone.

In  the  entire  Herceptin  program  to  date,  84  patients  (30  patients  in  pivotal  studies,  54  patients  in H0650g) were anthracycline naïve. Three (4  %) of these  patients,  (one  in  H0649g  and  two  in  trial H0650g), had events of heart failure. All three patients were elderly (aged 71, 76 and 79 years) and two had a documented history of coronary artery disease.

The safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients who experience cardiotoxicity has not  been  prospectively  studied.  Most  patients  who  developed  heart  failure  in  the  pivotal  trials improved  with  standard  medical  treatment.  This  included  diuretics,  cardiac  glycosides,  and/or angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors.  The  majority  of  patients  with  cardiac  symptoms  and evidence  of  a  clinical  benefit  of  Herceptin  treatment  continued  on  weekly  therapy  with  Herceptin without  additional  clinical  cardiac  events.  The  rate  of  cardiac  adverse  events  identified  after  the original evaluation of the CREC is summarised in the following table. Most patients with symptomatic cardiac dysfunction continued to receive Herceptin treatment. There was no obvious difference in the outcomes of patients who continued Herceptin therapy compared to those who withdrew from therapy. Due to the relatively small numbers of patients discontinuing therapy and the incompleteness of the EF  data,  the  current  information  does  not  allow  a  definitive  conclusion  regarding  the  effect  of continuation  or  discontinuation  of  Herceptin  in  patients  with  asymptomatic  or  symptomatic  cardiac dysfunction. However, since all planned trials will include prospective monitoring of cardiac function, this issue should be resolved with subsequent data.

## Summary of Outcome in patients with Heart Failure in the main Studies

|                     | N   | Cardiac outcome   | Cardiac outcome   | Cardiac outcome   |
|---------------------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                     |     | Improved          | Worsened          | unknown           |
| All                 | 41  | 32                | 5                 | 4                 |
| Continued Herceptin | 28  | 21                | 4                 | 3                 |
| Withdrawn           | 13  | 11                | 1                 | 1                 |

For patients with asymptomatic Reduced Ejection Fraction limited data were available. Due to the fact that  no  prospective  cardiac  monitoring  was  foreseen  in  the  study  protocol.  Therefore,  the  survival status  in  patients  known  to  have  a  reduced  ejection  fraction  was  compared  to  those  in  whom  no decrease was observed and no clear trend was determined.

The SPC contains a detailed section about the cardiotoxicity issue. According to this, caution should be  exercised  in  treating  patients  with  symptomatic  heart  failure,  a  history  of  hypertension,  or documented coronary artery disease. Candidates for treatment with Herceptin, especially those with prior anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiogram, and/or MUGA scan. A careful  risk-benefit  assessment  should  be  made  before  deciding  to  treat  with  Herceptin.  Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. every three months). Monitoring may help to  identify  patients  who  develop  cardiac  dysfunction.  Patients  who  develop  asymptomatic  cardiac dysfunction  may  benefit  from  more  frequent  monitoring  (e.g.  every  6-8  weeks).  If  patients  have  a continued  decrease  in  left  ventricular  function,  but  remain  asymptomatic,  the  physician  should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of Herceptin therapy has been seen.

If  symptomatic  cardiac  failure  develops  during  Herceptin  therapy,  it  should  be  treated  with  the standard  medications  for  this  purpose.  Discontinuation  of  Herceptin  therapy  should  be  strongly considered  in  patients  who  develop  clinically  significant  heart  failure  unless  the  benefits  for  an individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks.

## Safety issues identified through the post-marketing experience

Serious  adverse  reactions  including  infusion  reactions,  hypersensitivity,  allergic-like  reactions  and pulmonary  events  have  been  observed  in  patients  receiving  Herceptin  therapy.  The  company  as possibly related and serious infusion reactions assessed 74 reports. Most of these patients responded

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

well to supportive treatment and continued to receive Herceptin. 9/74 was reported with fatal outcome and 6 additional deaths. In some of these cases, a conclusive assessment was not possible due to the lack of data. All of these 9 deaths had pre-existing severe, malignancy-related respiratory distress, 7/9 were hospitalised prior to Herceptin infusion. Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may therefore be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. Therefore, it was required to contraindicate the use of Herceptin in those patients with severe pulmonary compromise with dyspnoea at rest.

The  severe  reactions  were  usually  associated  with  the  first  infusion  of  Herceptin  and  generally occurred  during  or  immediately  following  the  infusion.  For  some  patients,  symptoms  progressively worsened  and  led  to  further  pulmonary  complications.  Initial  improvement  followed  by  clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical deterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week following infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms or pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the Herceptin infusion. Patients should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their physician if these symptoms occur.

Since  at  present  the  mechanisms  of  the  above  mentioned  adverse  events,  risk  factors,  adequate premedication and tolerability of subsequent Herceptin infusions are unknown, a follow-up measure has been required to investigate these issues further.

## Infusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity

Serious adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion that have been reported infrequently include dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, urticaria and angioedema. The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the Herceptin infusion should be discontinued and the patient monitored until resolution of any observed symptoms. The majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of Herceptin. Serious  reactions  have  been  treated  successfully  with  supportive  therapy  such  as  oxygen,  betaagonists,  and  corticosteroids.  In  rare  cases,  these  reactions  are  associated  with  a  clinical  course culminating in a fatal outcome. Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced  malignancy  and  comorbidities  may  be  at  increased  risk  of  a  fatal  infusion  reaction. Therefore, these patients should not be treated with Herceptin.

An infusion  reaction  can  clinically  resemble  an  anaphylactic  or  other  allergic  reaction.  There  were single  cases  of  allergic  reactions  associated  with  subsequent  infusions.  It  is  difficult  to  differentiate between infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions due to a similar pattern of symptoms.

## Pulmonary events

Dyspnoea, bronchospasm, asthma and hypoxia can occur as part of an infusion reaction. These are most common with the first infusion and their severity decreases with subsequent infusions. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids.  Single  cases  of  pulmonary  infiltrates,  pneumonia,  pulmonary  effusion,  respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been reported rarely.

Adult  respiratory  distress  syndrome  has  been  reported  rarely  with  fatal  outcome.  Patients  who  are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients should not be treated by contraindication.

## Other safety issues

## Haematological toxicity

Haematological toxicity was infrequent following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent, WHO Grade III leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurring in &lt; 1% of patients. No WHO Grade IV toxicities were observed. There was an increase in WHO Grade III or IV haematological toxicity in patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel alone (34% versus 21%). This is possibly due to the result of greater cumulative

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure to paclitaxel in the Herceptin plus paclitaxel arm of the study as time to disease progression is increased in this patient group compared with the group treated with paclitaxel alone.

## Neuropathy

The raw incidence peripheral neuropathy was higher in the Herceptin group plus paclitaxel group than in  the  paclitaxel  alone  group.  However,  when  these  rates  were  adjusted  according  to  the  length  of observation  period  for  the  two  groups,  the  frequency  of  these  adverse  events  is  similar  between treatment groups. Nevertheless the issue has been addressed in the SPC.

## Leukaemia and myelodepression

The  incidence  of  leukaemia  observed  in  Herceptin  trials  so  far  does  not  exceed  that  expected  in  a population of metastatic breast cancer patients who have been treated with chemotherapy. To  date,  there  have  been  four  reports  of  secondary  acute  leukemia  and  one  report  of  chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in patients participating in Herceptin clinical trials in advanced breast cancer. All four of these patients received anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC) with Herceptin in either Study H0648g (n=3) or Study H0659g (n=1). These cases were considered in an analysis of incidence per patient year. The fifth case in study H0693g, was diagnosed in January 1999 in a patient receiving Herceptin and vinorelbine who had had prior CMF/anthracycline therapy and occurred after the analysis was performed. This patient had the characteristic 9:22 translocation of CML and was not felt to have drug-related leukemia.

When the Dec-97 cut-off (which included the first 3 cases) was used, the incidence rate was 0.81 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.17 to 2.36). Additional data through November 1998 were available only for patients in Studies H0648g and H0659g. Using a data cutoff date of 15 November 1998 for these two studies, the incidence rate was calculated as 0.76 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.95). These rates do not exceed expected rates estimated from a modified best evidence synthesis (BES);  a  systematic,  critical  evaluation  and  synthesis  of  the  global  literature  in  metastatic  breast cancer.

The  observed  number  of  four  cases  in  patients  receiving  Herceptin  treatment  in  combination  with chemotherapy  falls  below  the  expected  range  of  9-18  cases  predicted  by  the  BES  for  patients receiving both an alkylating agent and a topoisomerase inhibitor, and falls within the expected range of 2-8 cases predicted for patients treated with just one of these types of agent.

Based on this analysis, the current evidence does not support an association between Herceptin and an increased rate of secondary acute leukemia in women treated for metastatic breast cancer. Occurrence of leukemia or myelodysplasia will be observed in the future and data reported as a specific item of following PSURs. The issue is adequately addressed in the SPC.

## Hepatic and renal toxicity

WHO Grade III or IV hepatic toxicity was observed in 12% of patients following administration of Herceptin as single agent. This toxicity was associated with progression of disease in the liver in 60% of these patients. WHO Grade III or IV hepatic toxicity was less frequently observed among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel than among patients receiving paclitaxel (7% compared with 15%). No WHO Grade III or IV renal toxicity was observed in patients treated with Herceptin.

## Diarrhoea

Of patients treated with Herceptin as a single agent, 27% experienced diarrhoea. An increase in the incidence  of  diarrhoea,  primarily  mild  to  moderate  in  severity,  has  also  been  observed  in  patients receiving Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel alone.

## Infection

An  increased  incidence  of  infections,  primarily  mild  upper  respiratory  infections  of  minor  clinical significance or catheter infections, has been observed primarily in patients treated with Herceptin plus paclitaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel alone.

## Anti-Herceptin antibodies

All except two patients in the two pivotal trials have been evaluated for antibody production. Human anti- trastuzumab antibodies were detected in one patient, who had no allergic manifestations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Discussion on Clinical Efficacy and Safety

As a result of the assessment of the clinical data ten major objections were raised related to efficacy and safety of the product. In particular, there were concerns on the insufficient efficacy data, the low level of efficacy observed in the paclitaxel alone arm of the pivotal study, the potential bias induced by the open-label design of the clinical studies, the pharmacodynamic behaviour of the antibody, the cardiotoxic reactions of Herceptin alone and in combination with chemotherapy and the development of peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, a large number of points for clarification were raised, among them of particular concern was the correlation of the clinical benefit of patients with the level of HER2 overexpression,  the  impact  of  the  diagnostic  determination  of  HER2  overexpression  on  the  correct clinical grading of patients, the increase of CNS metastases in the Herceptin arms and safety issues such as Herceptin's potential of inducing leukemia and myelodepression.

In their response, the applicant replied on the major concern of using a 440 mg multidose vial with bacteriostatic water as solvent by providing a proposal to use a 150 mg single dose vial instead.

## Efficacy and level of HER2 overexpression

There was concern over the lack of correlation between the clinical benefit and the HER2 expression level.  Since  study  H0648g  was  not  designed  to  allow  for  subgroup  analysis  of  patients  expression HER2 at 2+ or 3+ level and no stratification at randomisation on the basis of level of overexpression nor for other potential prognostic factors was performed, analysis was only retrospectively available. Nonetheless, on the basis of the analysis provided by the applicant as part of the response and during the  oral  presentation,  it  was  concluded  that  a  benefit  is  only  really  discernible  in  the  3+  groups.  A significant  difference  in  both  the  H0648  and  H0649  study  concerning  the  primary  endpoint  TTP  is only achieved in the 3+ overexpressing HER2 group. Accordingly, the indication has been limited to patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression at a 3+ level.

## Diagnostic methods to determine HER2

The  diagnostic  methodology  used  to  determine  HER2  overexpression  in  patients  before  Herceptin treatment  is  of  importance  in  order  to  identify  the  patients  who  benefit  most.  In  the  clinical  trial patients were enrolled if they had 2+ or 3+ levels of overexpression, determined by a immunohistochemical method (IHC) performed by one central testing laboratory.

The  data  showed  that  only  laboratories  specialised  in  performing  immunohistochemistry  should investigate the tumour specimens.

This has been adequately addressed in the SPC.

## Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel

Treatment options will only change for a small group of patients, those with HER2 positive tumors. The  indication  was  supported  since  the  real  target  group  for  the  use  of  Herceptin  can  be  clearly identified by the use of appropriate diagnostic methods.

Therefore, a strong requirement for the SPC recommendation on the use of diagnostic methods has been implemented. However, there were arguments to limit the indication to patients who did receive prior  adjuvant  and  to  patients  for  whom  AC  is  not  suitable.  There  are  no  data  available  on  those patients with no prior adjuvant AC (approx. 10% of MBC patients). Furthermore, comparative data to AC (AC vs. H+P) are not taken into  account  for  approval  decision.  Therefore,  the  wording  of  the indication under b) combination therapy was amended as follows:

'....b)  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom AC is not suitable'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Herceptin as a single agent in second- and third-line therapy

The applicant has presented a substantial and detailed discussion of the data observed with Herceptin used  as  single  agent  in  second  line  therapy  as  compared  to  the  current  knowledge  of  alternative treatment  options.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  patients  recruited  into  the  study  H0649g  had  the characteristics of a poor prognostic group in which any further chemotherapy would be expected to be associated  with  a  low  response  rate.  Herceptin  was  well  tolerated  in  the  pivotal  monotherapy  trial, even  by  patients  who  had  received  multiple  prior  chemotherapy  regimens.  Despite  the  poor characteristics, Herceptin monotherapy led to an objective response rate of 14 % in these patients. In addition,  36%  of  patients  had  a  minor  response  or  stable  disease.  The  monotherapy  indication  was therefore considered acceptable whereas the wording of the indication was changed in order to limit the use to patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease (instead  of  one  or  more).  Prior  chemotherapy  must  have  included  at  least  an  anthracycline  and  a taxane  unless  patients  are  unsuitable  for  these  treatments.  Hormone  receptor  positive  patients  must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments

## Safety

Substantial assessment has been performed on the new safety issues which arised within the procedure leading to comprehensive changes of the SPC:

##  4.4.: mentioning of

Infusion related reactions, including fatal outcome

Hypersensitivity reactions, including some with fatal outcome

Pulmonary events, including ARDS, pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary oedema

-  4.4.:  adequate  information  about  the  onset,  frequency,  progression  and  outcome  of  AEs  (i.e., majority during or after first infusion, within 6 hours, some cases may occur later, also after first improvement)
-  4.4.: adequate information about risk groups
-  4.4.:  adequate  information  and  recommendation  about  how  to  administer  Herceptin,  how  to monitor patients and how to treat AEs
-  4.4.: recommendation on the need to inform patients about the potential (re)occurrence of events with onset at a later time point
-  4.8. was updated entirely according to the assessment taking into account the above mentioned points for 4.4. Furthermore, three separate chapters on Infusion related reactions, Hypersensitivity reactions, and pulmonary events were included.
-  4.3. A contraindication in those patients with severe pulmonary compromise with dyspnoea at rest was introduced.
-  4.2. It was required that patients are monitored for at least 6 hours after the first infusion and for at least 2 hours after subsequent infusions

## 5. Overall Conclusion and benefit risk assessment

The  data  provided  on  quality  were  adequate  and  demonstrated  that  Herceptin  is  manufactured  and controlled  according  to  the  requirements.  The  preclinical  characterisation  of  Herceptin  has  been performed according to the requirements and showed adequate preclinical safety.

Five clinical questions were still outstanding to be clarified at an oral presentation in order to justify the  proposed  Monotherapy  indication,  the  explain  the  impact  of  the  indication  of  Herceptin  in combination with paclitaxel in First-line Therapy on the use of current standard treatment regimens of metastatic  disease,  to  discuss  the  correlation  between  the  clinical  benefit  and  the  HER2  expression level, further discuss the data presented in the recent PSUR in relation to serious allergic reactions and infusion  related  reactions  and  the  impact  of  these  data  on  the  risk  benefit  assessment.  From  the assessment  of  the  second  PSUR  two  additional  questions  resulted  which  were  addressed  by  the applicant at the Oral presentation (overview of the number of anthracycline naive patients with cardiac

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

events and outcome, re-assessment of those cases from clinical trials where the causality assessment of the drug/event relationship was listed by the investigator as at least possible).

As outcome of the Oral presentation, the clinical efficacy and safety has been considered sufficiently demonstrated to recommend approval of Herceptin on clinical grounds. The Committee considered the applied indications acceptable with the suggested changes of the SPC.

The  company  will  perform  a  large  number  of  clinical  trials  worldwide  to  investigate  combinations with new medications, the adjuvant use of Herceptin, safety and pharmacodynamic issues. In addition, the  company  committed  a  number  of  follow-up  measures  for  further  investigation  of  clinically relevant questions, which are listed separately.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by majority decision that the benefit/risk  profile  of  Herceptin in  the  treatment of  patients  with  metastatic  breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2

a) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.

b)  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease for whom an anthracycline is not suitable.

Was favourable.

## 6. Update on pharmacokinetics from Follow-up Measures: Study BO15935

Roche committed to investigate further the PK of trastuzumab in post-authorisation studies. Preliminary PK data derived from Study BO15935 indicated a longer half-life for Herceptin than originally estimated. The interim report of study BO15935 and the re-analysis of the data of singleagent studies and the combined Herceptin+paclitaxel data of the pivotal study HO648 provided with the Marketing Authorisation Application were assessed.

Based on the single agent studies H0407g n=16, H0551g n=46 and H0649g n=213 as well as on the data  from  trial  H0648g,  n=234  (where  Herceptin  was  co-administered  with  either  +  anthracycline/ cyclophosphamide  (AC)  or  paclitaxel)  the  population  PK  was  re-analysed  to  assess  the  effect  of pathophysiologic  covariates  and  the  potential  influence  of  concomitant  chemotherapy  (Herceptin  + AC or paclitaxel) on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. A non-linear mixed model approach was employed to analyze the data using a linear two-compartment model with zero-order input (infusion) as base model.

In a first step a model  for  pathophysiologic  covariates  (i.e.  demographic  factors,  laboratory parameters, HER2 overexpression, shed antigen, number of metastatic sites) was built using data from the single agent trials only. First, covariates were added sequentially to the model in order to evaluate the  effect  of  the  covariates  on  clearance  and  central  compartment  distribution  volume.  Having identified  those  covariates  improving  the  model  fit  statistically  significant  the  correlation  between covariates was evaluated in order to determine which covariates should be incorporated in the 'full' model. The full model incorporated the following covariates: total protein, shed antigen, and number of  metastatic  sites  (for  clearance)  and  weight,  total  bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase,  number  of metastatic  sites,  and  shed  antigen  (for  volume  of  distribution).  As  a  non-linear  relationship  was discovered between shed antigen and clearance respectively volume of distribution, shed antigen was modeled  nonlinearly  while  all  other  parameters  were  modelled  linearly.  Removing  each  covariate from the full model one at a time in order to identify those covariates that significantly influence the model fit then derived the final model. By means of this approach 'number of metastatic sites' and 'shed  antigen'  were  identified  as  the  most  influential  covariates  in  the  model  for  clearance,  and 'weight' and 'shed antigen' were the influential covariates in the model for volume of distribution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a second step the data from the concomitant chemotherapy Study H0648 were added to the dataset and  the  effect  of  concomitant  chemotherapy  on  the  final  model  was  evaluated.  After  adjusting  for baseline  covariates,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  of  concomitant  chemotherapy  on clearance  or  volume  of  distribution.  Therefore,  concomitant  chemotherapy  was  not  included  in  the final model.

The model and program used to re-evaluate the PK data is considered adequate. The two-compartment model has been determined to be more appropriate to describe the PK data than the one-compartment model used previously. It cannot be excluded that a third compartment is involved, however, with the currently available data the two-compartment model is considered appropriate.

In  conclusion,  the  re-assessed  data  indicate  that  the  half-life  is  approximately  28.5  days  (95% confidence  interval,  25.5  -32.8  days).  The  washout  period  is  up  to  20  weeks  (95%  confidence interval, 18-24 weeks). Steady state pharmacokinetics should be reached by approximately 20 weeks ( 95 % confidence interval, 18 - 24 weeks ). The estimated mean AUC was 578 mg day/L and the estimated mean peak and trough concentrations were 110 mg/L and 66 mg/L, respectively. The mean clearance  when a loading dose of  4 mg/kg trastuzumab followed by a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg/kg was used was 0.225 L/day. The volume of distribution approximated serum volume, 2.95 L. Detectable  concentrations  of  the  circulating  extracellular  domain  of  the  HER2  receptor  (shed antigen)  are  found  in  the  serum  of  some  patients  with  HER2  overexpressing  breast  cancers. Determination of shed antigen in baseline serum samples revealed that 64 % (286/447) of patients had detectable shed antigen, which ranged as high as 1880 ng/ml (median = 11 ng/ml). The section 5.2  of  the  SPC  was  updated  accordingly.  A  sentence  informing  the  patient  of  the  long  washout period of Herceptin was included in the Package Leaflet section 2. Letters to the physicians and a relevant public statement were issued in May 2001 informing the prescribers on the longer half life and wash-out period and the fact that due to this, potential risk of cardiotoxicity needs to be carefully considered when patients are treated or have been treated with Herceptin.

## 7. Update of Clinical Safety post-authorisation.

The statement on cardiotoxicity (SPC section 4.4) and the need for cardiac function monitoring has been  emphasised,  the  warning  was  strengthened  and  extended  to  all  candidates  for  receiving Herceptin, including anthracycline - naive patients. Severe rare pulmonary events are also described under 4.4. as requested by the CPMP following the assessment of the 3rd PSUR, pneumonitis has also been added in respiratory serious adverse reactions (section 4.8) and hypertension has been added as an infusion related syndrome. Following the assessment of the 1st PSUR glomerulopathy was added in 4.8.  Section  4.8  'Undesirable  effects',  was  amended  to  include  pulmonary  fibrosis  following  an update to the Sponsor's Core Data Sheet as presented in the 5th PSUR.

## 8. Additional indication: Herceptin in combination with Taxotere

An  extension  of  the  indication  for  the  combination  of  Herceptin  and  docetaxel  (Taxotere)  as  a treatment for patients with HER2-positive MBC was based on data from:.

- Study  JP16003.  This  is  a  clinical  pharmacology  study  in  Japanese  patients,  assessing  the pharmacokinetics of Herceptin and docetaxel in combination.
- Study  M77001.  This  controlled,  randomized,  multi-centre  pivotal  trial  was  designed  to investigate efficacy and safety of the combination of Herceptin and docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone.
- Publications from six completed and two ongoing phase II supportive efficacy studies.

Safety information from four ongoing multicenter trials on HER2-positive MBC patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and docetaxel.

The main characteristics of these studies are summarised in table 1 below.

## Pharmacokinetics

The applicant  provided (limited)  information  on  the  PK  of  Herceptin  in  Japanese  patients.  Using  a population PK approach an attempt was made to assess the comparability of the PK in Japanese and non-Japanese patients. Due to limited number of Japanese patients this approach does not allow for a final conclusion. There are no additional PK data dealing with the possible impact of docetaxel on the PK of Herceptin. This is in a way justified by pointing to the similarity of taxanes in general.

## Pharmacodynamics

No  specific  pharmacodynamic  study  has  been  performed.  The  data  gained  from  the  exploratory pharmacodynamic  analysis  of  the  pivotal  trial  M77001  are  too  limited  to  draw  any  conclusion concerning  trends  between  shed  HER2  extracellular  domain  (ECD)  and  clinical  response.  Thus  it remains open whether ECD concentrations at baseline &gt; 200 ng/mL are predictive of a worse clinical outcome. Regarding the immunogenicity of the combination Herceptin + docetaxel, there is no new information on the incidence of anti-Herceptin antibodies. No patient receiving the combination has been tested, because no unusual immune complex diseases or manifestations have been reported.

## Clinical efficacy

Study M77001 was an open-label, comparative, multicenter, multinational, randomized phase II study, conducted as pivotal trial with the title:' A multicenter, randomized comparative study on the efficacy and safety of Herceptin (trastuzumab) plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as first line treatment in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer'. Eligible patients had to have metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression/amplification (IHC3+ and/or FISH positive) who had not previously received chemotherapy except, given as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.

All patients were randomised to receive Herceptin in combination with docetaxel or docetaxel alone. The loading dose of 4mg /kg Herceptin was given intravenously over 90 minutes on day 1, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly Herceptin infusions over 30 minutes until disease progression. Patients received an initial  dose  of  docetaxel  (100mg/m 2 )  intravenously on the day following the first dose of Herceptin (study  day  2).  Docetaxel  in  subsequent  cycles  (every  3  weeks)  was  administered  30  minutes  after completion of the Herceptin infusion, if the preceding dose of Herceptin was well tolerated.

Primary endpoint: · Overall response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm. (Complete response CR plus partial response PR) during the treatment period.

The  investigator,  according  to  WHO  criteria,  assessed  the  tumour  response  levels.  Additionally  an independent radiological review (IRR) evaluated the best response unless best response was PD. In case of different assessments reconciliation was performed manually to decide whether the difference was  due  to  over-riding  clinical  factors  (i.e.  information  not  available  to  the  IRR  who  performed  a radiological review only). For the primary analysis, this reconciled data was used (i.e. IRR assessment modified to reflect over-riding clinical data, otherwise the IRR  assessment prevailed). The investigator's assessments were analysed separately and considered secondary.

## Secondary endpoints:

· To characterise the safety profile of docetaxel plus Herceptin and of docetaxel as a single agent in patients with HER2-positive MBC.

·  To  determine  the  time  to  progression  (TTP),  progression-free  survival  (PFS), time  to  treatment failure (TTF), time to response, duration of response and overall survival.

The analysis of efficacy was primarily based on the full analysis set (FAS) defined by all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication (including the chemotherapy part). Groups were defined as they were randomised. In addition a per protocol set (PPS) was defined as subset of the FAS, excluding patients fulfilling at least one of the following criteria:

1. Prior  chemotherapy  treatments  specifically  listed  in  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  for  the protocol.
2. Failure to receive at least one dose of assigned treatment medication.
3. Patients with LVEF &lt;40% at baseline
4. Patients  who  fail  to  meet  the  tumour  assessment  criteria  specified  in  the  inclusion/exclusion criteria for the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5. Absence  of  documentation  of  over-expression/amplification  of  HER2  as  specified  in  the protocol.
6. Absence of documentation of protocol specified tumour.
7. Baseline ECOG &gt; 2.

Furthermore, the statistical analysis plan specified various subgroups (e.g according age, number of metastatic organ sites etc) for additional analyses.

For the  primary  efficacy  variable,  overall  reconciled  response  rates  overall  response  rates  and  95% confidence limits according to Pearson-Clopper were calculated for each treatment group. The HauckAnderson  approach  was  used  to  calculate  confidence  limits  for  the  difference.  Although,  not  the primary focus according protocol, the overall reconciled response rates in both treatment groups were compared by means of a 2sided chi-square test.

The same approach as for the primary variable (except hypothesis testing) was used to analyse the best tumour  response  (CR,  PR,  SD,  PD),  both  reconciled  and  by  investigator.  A  summary  of  the concordance between IRR best response and investigator best response was also made.

For time to event endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated and displayed. Medians and corresponding 95% confidence limits were given if they were reached. If large treatment differences were seen a two-sided log rank test was used to compare the hazard rates between both treatment groups. All analyses for time to event endpoints were performed for the FAS population. Only for TTP the analysis was repeated for the per protocol set and the subgroups mentioned above.

Trends between ECD and clinical response were assessed by means of an exploratory analysis.

## Results

Both groups were balanced with regard to demographic, baseline and disease characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median age in the docetaxel group was 55 years, in the docetaxel + Herceptin group 53 years and 90 and 99% of the patients were Caucasian. In both groups breast cancer histories and treatments were comparable.  The  median  duration  of  primary  disease  (time  from  first  diagnosis  to  diagnosis  of metastasis)  was  22.6  and  26.6  months  in  the  docetaxel  group  and  in  the  combination  group, respectively.  At  study  entry  the  median  duration  of  metastatic  disease  (time  from  diagnosis  of metastasis to entry in the study) was 1.0 months (range 0 - 66.8 months) in the docetaxel arm versus 1.3 months (range 0 - 67.9 months) for the patients in the docetaxel + Herceptin group.

Approximately  two  thirds  of  patients  in  both  groups  had  received  previous  radiotherapy  (66%  in docetaxel  and  64%  in  docetaxel  +  Herceptin)  and  chemotherapy  (68%  in  docetaxel  and  71%  in docetaxel  +  Herceptin)  as  (neo)adjuvant  treatment.  As  part  of  it,  slightly  more  patients  in  the docetaxel+Herceptin arm had received prior anthracycline therapy (64% in the Herceptin arm versus 55% in the docetaxel arm). The primary tumours were more frequently estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive in the docetaxel group (53 patients = 56%) than in the docetaxel + Herceptin group (38 patients = 41%). In both treatment arms the degree of HER2 overexpression was comparable with 87% and 88% of patients in the docetaxel arm and the docetaxel +Herceptin arm, respectively, being tested IHC3+. Overall, 92 % and 96 % had IHC3+ and/or FISH positive disease. In median number of metastases was 4 metastases located at 2 sites with a very slightly higher burden of disease in patients in the docetaxel alone arm as compared to patients in the docetaxel + Herceptin arm (2 - 5 % more patients had lung, liver, bone and soft tissue metastases).

Cardiovascular  risk  factors  other  than  prior  anthracycline  use  were  well  balanced  between  the  two treatment arms except for smoking (10% versus 20%).

The results in terms of efficacy endpoints can be summarised as follows:

Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (time  to  response  and  duration  of  response)  were  assessed  using  the investigator assessed tumour response. Additional survival time, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and time to failure (TTF) were evaluated. The final analysis was conducted when all patients had been observed for at least 6 months, or had withdrawn or died. At data-cut-off nearly all patients 177/186 (95%) had been followed for at least 1 year (withdrawn or died) and the median duration  of  follow-up  was  12.4  and  14.6  months  in  the  docetaxel  respectively  docetaxel+Herceptin arm. The results are summarised in the following table:

+ censored observations

Efficacy data were also presented from six completed and two ongoing phase I/II published studies, as well as from the Japanese clinical pharmacology study (JP16003) and from an ongoing communitybased study in the US (HER-First study) They are considered to be supportive for the combination therapy with docetaxel plus Herceptin. All studies had an open-label design. The pivotal, randomised study M77001 and the ongoing community based phase IV study in the US recruited a large patient population,  (188  and  314  patients  respectively)  whereas  the  remaining  phase  I/II  studies  were  only conducted with &lt;42 patients. Herceptin was given in the approved dose and regimen (4mg/kg iv initial dose  followed  by  2mg/kg  weekly).  Only  in  one  (Esteva  et  al)  study  there  was  a  minor  variation because every fourth dose of Herceptin was omitted (ie three weekly doses and one week's rest). The docetaxel  regimen  varied  in  dose  and  dosing  interval  (q1w  and  q3w)  with  a  weekly  regimen  of between 30-35mg/m 2 in about half of the studies.

Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  supportive  studies  were  comparable  and  thus  the populations similar to that of the pivotal study. However, there were differences with regard to the disease  characteristics  and  pre-study  treatment.  Across  studies  women  with  ICH  2+  tumours  and unknown  gene  amplification  status  were  included.  Around  30%  of  patients  had  received  prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease compared to none in the pivotal study. Prior anthracycline use varied between 24 and 100% (pivotal study ~64-68%). The average tumour burden was similar across all studies.

The comparison of the efficacy results is based on the investigator,s assessment of the pivotal study data, since the supportive studies did not have independent reviews. The overall response rate in the Herceptin +docetaxel arm of the pivotal study was 70% (44% in the docetaxel alone arm) and lies within the range reported in the other studies (44% to 83% in the completed studies). However, the supportive  studies  are  heterogeneous  and  differ  in  their  applied  docetaxel  regimens,  the  degree  of pretreatment  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  HER-2  3+  disease.  The  lowest  reported  response study of 44% in an ongoing study might change because of 3 minor ongoing responses. Additionally, in those completed studies evaluating median TTP the data are similar with a range between 8.3 and 9 months compared to 10.6 months in the pivotal study.

## Clinical Safety

Safety data on the Herceptin plus docetaxel combination is derived from the pivotal study M77001, and from the Japanese clinical pharmacology study JP16003. Interim safety information comes from an ongoing randomised study investigating Herceptin + docetaxel ± capecitabine (MO16149 study). Supplementary information is provided on serious AEs (SAEs) occurring in 2 ongoing studies: one community-based study in the USA (Study H2251n) and one co-operative group study (BCIRG007). Limited safety information is available in the literature from six completed and two ongoing phase I/II studies of efficacy and safety, and from an expanded access program in the UK. In total, data from approximately 700 patients with HER2-positive MBC who received Herceptin in combination with docetaxel in clinical trials are available and more than 80 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer

have been treated with the combination in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Duration of observation ranges up to 29.7 months in the pivotal study, and greater than 20 months in the supporting studies. This assessment will focus mainly on the data gained from the pivotal study.

Adverse events in the pivotal study with an incidence &gt;10% mainly included those usually associated with  docetaxel  treatment  (eg  alopecia,  asthenia,  nausea,  diarrhoea,  peripheral  oedema,  vomiting, neuropathy  and  neutropenia).  The  incidence  of  these  events  was  generally  slightly  higher  in  the Herceptin plus docetaxel arm than in the control arm. Common adverse events in the Herceptin plus docetaxel arm that occurred infrequently in the  docetaxel alone arm included influenza-like illness, and rigors, which are common infusion, related reactions with Herceptin treatment. The slightly higher incidence of  diarrhea  in  the  Herceptin  plus  docetaxel  arm  (43%  versus  36%)  is  consistent  with  the addition of Herceptin to docetaxel since both drugs cause some diarrhoea.

With regard to the incidence of adverse events by body system the following differences between both treatment  arms  were  observed:  AEs  related  to  respiratory  system  disorders  were  increased  in  the Herceptin arm compared to the docetaxel alone arm and included nasal passage, larynx and pharynx disorders like irritation, pain, erythema, epistaxis, rhinorrhoea etc. The incidence of infections in the combination arm was higher (53% vs 40%) and mainly due to an increase in nasopharyngitis (15% vs 6%). Cardiac-related events were more frequent in the Herceptin arm (12% vs 3%) with most of them being tachycardia (6.5% vs 0%) and palpitations (3% vs 1%).

In the pivotal study M77001 up to the cut-off data a total of 54 patients died, 50 due to progressive disease and 4 as a result of adverse events. The deaths of two patients in the docetaxel alone arm (1 sepsis, 1 multi-organ failure) were considered to be related to docetaxel treatment. Two patients in the Herceptin plus docetaxel arm died with cardiac failure in the context of progressive disease. One event was judged to  be  related  to  Herceptin,  the  other  one  not.  In  one  case,  the  patient  received  a  novel anthracycline one month after stopping Herceptin and this was felt to have been the primary cause of heart failure. In other clinical studies there were six fatal serious adverse events in patients receiving the  Herceptin  plus  docetaxel  combination:  4  events  of  neutropenic  sepsis  (2  of  them  under neoadjuvant therapy), 1 hepatic failure, 1 case with brain metastases. Hepatic failure was related to the treatment with both Herceptin and docetaxel (autopsy pending), 2-neutropenic sepses were considered to  be  related  to  docetaxel  alone.  In  2  ongoing  studies  MO16419  and  BCIRG007 a  total  of  3  fatal events  occurred  in  the  three-drug  arms  in  patients  with  neutropenia:  patients  with  pulmonary embolism  and  atypical  pneumonia  (death  related  to  docetaxel)  had  received  Herceptin  +  docetaxel +capecitabine,  the  patient  who  died  due  to  neutropenic  enterocolitis  had  received  Herceptin  + docetaxel +platinum salt.

The overall incidence of serious adverse events was as follows:

Pivotal study M77001

: 104 SAEs in 66 patients

Study MO16419

: 56 SAEs in 30 patients

Study BCIRG007:

80 SAEs in 42 patients

HER-First

study: in 19 patients

Study M77998

: 33 drug-related SAEs in 33 patients

In the pivotal study a total of 104 SAEs other than death were reported: 42 in 29/94 (31%) patients in the docetaxel arm and 62 in 37/92 patients (40%) in the docetaxel plus Herceptin arm. The types of SAEs  occurring  were  well  balanced  between  both  treatment  arms.  SAEs  occurring  in  at  least  2% patients are summarised in the following table:

## Discussion on efficacy

There is clear evidence of efficacy. The presented results from the pivotal study M77001, demonstrate that  a  significantly  higher  overall  tumour  response  was  observed  in  the  patients  receiving  the combination  docetaxel  +  Herceptin  compared  to  the  monotherapy  group  with  docetaxel.  The combination Herceptin + docetaxel is more effective than docetaxel alone for anthracycline pre-treated and  anthracycline  naïve  patients  in  terms  of  overall  response  rate,  median  duration  of  response, median TTP and median survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Supportive efficacy  data  for  the  combination  therapy  are  available  from  6  completed  and  2  ongoing  studies reported in the literature.

The estimated median survival times have increased with longer follow up to an estimated median of 30.5 months compared with the docetaxel alone arm (estimated median 22.1 months) (p=0.0062).

Objectives and endpoints in the pivotal trial were chosen according to the CPMP 'NfG on Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man'. The tumour response was standardised and assessed based on the WHO criteria. Additionally an external independent radiological review (IRR) evaluated the best  response  unless  best  response  was  PD.  The  chosen  primary  endpoint  was  the  overall  tumour response (CR + PR). To support the clinical benefit the following secondary endpoints were selected: time to and duration of response, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression free survival (PFS). The statistical methods used are appropriate.

The results are consistent with those of Herceptin + paclitaxel in the original pivotal trial H0648g trial (see table below) and are supported by the results of the trials reported in the literature.

The design of the M77001 trial was based on the strongly positive results from Herceptin + paclitaxel in the original pivotal trial H0648g trial and was done as a follow-on trial in order to test an alternative taxane  and  answer  the  question  whether  Herceptin  adds  to  docetaxel  monotherapy.  The  choice  of docetaxel -single agent as comparator was extensively discussed during an oral explanation with the MAH. It was considered that although single agent docetaxel is not an approved first line treatment in metastatic breast cancer, it is widely used. Moreover as use of anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting is current practice, metastatic patients are usually unsuitable to be treated with anthracyclines.

As Herceptin was effective both in anthracycline-naive and  anthracycline-pre-treated patients, there are  no  grounds  to  restrict  the  combination  Herceptin  +  taxane  to  patients  who  have  had  prior anthracycline therapy or for whom anthracycline therapy is not suitable. It would have been preferable to have a pre-specified sub-group analysis in relation to previous anthracycline therapy rather than as a post-hoc  decision.  However,  despite  being  an  exploratory  analysis  there  was  sufficient  power  to demonstrate  statistically  significant  benefit  in  both  subgroups:  OR  67%  vs  38%  (p=0.014)  in  the subgroup  of  no  prior  anthacycline  treatment  and  58%  vs  35%  (p=0.015)  in  the  subgroup  of  prior adjuvant anthracycline treatment.

The  MAH committed to  further  elaborate  the  dosing  regimen  of  Herceptin  by  submitting  the  final study reports for a phase II study of Herceptin monotherapy administered 3 weekly in women with HER2 overexpression/amplification in metastatic breast cancer study WO16229. Furthermore the 3weekly regimen is studied in HERA trial, a randomised three-arm multi-centre comparison of 1 year and 2 years of Herceptin versus no Herceptin in women with HER2-positive primary breast cancer who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy. The MAH has already submitted the final study report for the BO15935 trial: A phase I/II study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Herceptin (trastuzumab) and paclitaxel in three weekly combinations in women with metastatic breast cancer.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The data set for the safety evaluation was based on the pivotal study M77001 and on the Japanese clinical  pharmacology  study  JP16003.  Additional  information  is  provided  from  2  interim  safety reports and from published literature reports. Approximately 700 patients with HER2-positive MBC exposed to Herceptin plus docetaxel have been treated.

Patients  always  received  Herceptin  in  the  recommended  dose,  however  the  dosing  regimen  of docetaxel varied across studies. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with no new or unexpected safety signals. The incidence of common, non-serious adverse events was higher in the combination with Herceptin, as was the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) and serious adverse events.

The  overall  rate  of  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF)  was  low  (2-4%),  probably  because  36%  in  the combination group and 45% on the docetaxel alone group were anthracycline naive. The 2 patients dieing  in  the  pivotal  study  were  anthracycline-pretreated.  More  patients  receiving  Herceptin  had asymptomatic  LVEF declines  (&gt;15%).  However,  the  incidence  of  CHF  and  asymptomatic  declines was  within  the  range  expected  for  patients  under  Herceptin  therapy.  The  addition  of  Herceptin  to docetaxel increased the incidence of transient grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% versus 22% in the docetaxel alone  arm).  The  same  was  observed  for  febrile  neutropenia  (23%  versus  17%),  suggesting  that Herceptin  may  exacerbate  the  docetaxel-associated  myelosuppression.  No  new  concerns  have  been identified  regarding  the  severity  and  frequency  of  infusion-related  reactions  with  the  combination Herceptin+  docetaxel.  However,  the  risk  of  neutropenic  events  is  increased  and  exceeds  that  of docetaxel alone. There were fewer safety related withdrawals for patients in the combination arm.

The safety profile described in the main analysis (6 months after last patient entered) has not changed with the addition of data up to the 12-month cut-off. No new unexpected adverse events have occurred and the relative incidence of different types of AEs is similar to that seen at the 6-month analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of decreases in LVEF (falls &gt; 15% or absolute value &lt;40%) remains the same. It  can  be  concluded  that  no  new  emerging  safety  concerns  could  be  identified  and  in  principle,  the toxicity profile is consistent with that of the two drugs alone.

## Benefit - Risk assessment

Herceptin administered weekly in combination with 3-weekly docetaxel is an efficacious treatment of patients  with  HER2-positive  metastatic breast cancer. The benefit in terms of overall response rate, duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival is comparable with that of the licensed combination  Herceptin  plus  paclitaxel.  In  principal  no  new  emerging  safety  signals  could  be identified.

The  benefit  risk  ratio  in  the  indication: in  combination  with  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those patients, who have not received chemotherapy for there metastatic disease, is therefore positive.

## 9. Update of the SPC on diagnostic methods to determine HER2 status.

Herceptin,  a  humanized  anti-HER2  antibody  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  MBC  patients  whose tumours overexpress HER2 as determined by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) diagnostic assay. This overexpression of the HER2 receptor in breast cancer is triggered by amplification of the HER2 gene located on chromosome 17. The amplification leads to increased transcription and consequently to an overexpression of HER2 receptor proteins on the cell surface and is found in 20% to 30% of breast cancer tumours. Only patients with a strong overexpression (IHC score of 3+) are HER2 positive and thus eligible for Herceptin treatment.

The diagnosis of HER2 expression in the pivotal trials was performed using in-house investigational assays.  In  parallel  to  the  clinical  development,  a  commercial  assay  was  developed  by  DAKO,  the HercepTest® (DakoCytomation). In the meantime diagnostic developments continued and led to the introduction of HER2 testing methodologies based on the detection of HER2 gene amplification which is  the  initial  genetic  event  that  results  in  HER2  overexpression.  Fluorescence in  situ hybridisation (FISH)  and  chromogenic in  situ hybridisation  (CISH)  assays  were  developed  and  validated  against IHC.

The SPC for Herceptin was updated in order to reflect the recent progress in the diagnostic methods to determine the HER2 status of a patient (previously defined on the basis of an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) were  included  as  an  alternative  to  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  to  assess  the  eligibility  of  MBC patients for Herceptin therapy.

## Methods.

For  the  individual  treatment  regimen  of  a  patient  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  it  is  essential  to determine the HER2 status, because only patients with a strong overexpression (IHC score 3+) that denotes HER2  positivity will benefit from  Herceptin therapy. Therefore reliable and robust methodologies for the determination of the HER2 status are required. All assays described below are for usage on paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and assess the HER2 status on a cell-by-cell basis.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) employs antibodies specifically directed against an epitope of the HER2 protein in the tumour tissue, thereby detecting HER2 on the cell surface. HER2 expression in fixed breast  tumour  samples  is  recognized  by  a  typical  IHC  staining  pattern  of  tumour  cells  and  is interpreted semi-quantitatively by the observer, applying a 0 to 3+ scale, where IHC3+ indicates the strongest  staining  intensity.  The  advantages  of  IHC  are  its  wide  availability,  speed,  simplicity  and relative low cost.

New  methodologies  like  fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH )  and  chromogenic in situ hybridisation ( CISH ) detect the genetic event, HER2  gene amplification, which leads to overexpression  of  HER2  on  the  cell  surface.  These  DNA-based  methodologies  directly  assess  the HER2 gene copy number, and use labelled complementary DNA probes to detect HER2-specific DNA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sequences by hybridisation. Interpretation of the testing results is numeric and more quantitative than IHC.  DNA  is  an  inherently  more  stable  target  compared  to  protein  as  it  is  less  susceptible  to degradation. With CISH the HER2 gene is detected using a peroxidase enzyme-labelled probe with a chromogenic detection instead of using a fluorescent (FISH) dye to visualize the HER2 gene copies. One  advantage  is  that  a  standard  light  microscope  can  view  CISH  staining  signals  and  the histopathology of the specimen can be assessed simultaneously.

To date, two IHC assays, three FISH assays and one CISH assay are commercially available. These are CE marked IVD assays in accordance with Directive 98/79/EC.

## IHC assays

- -HercepTest (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) was developed in 1998, in order to have a diagnostic  tool  to  select  patients  suitable  for  Herceptin  therapy,  as  the  Clinical  Trials  Assay (CTA), used in the two pivotal trials for the initial approval of Herceptin, was too impractical for commercialization and widespread clinical use.
- -PathWay HER2 assay (for  use  with  the  Benchmark®  automated  System;  Ventana  Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, USA): was developed in 2000 to aid in assisting the selection of patients for Herceptin therapy whose tumours overexpress HER2.

In Europe, MBC patients are eligible for receiving Herceptin when their tumours express HER2 at an IHC score of 3+ (on a visualisation scale of 0, 1+, 2+, 3+).

## FISH assays for detecting HER2 gene amplification



- -PathVysion FISH assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, USA) uses a 190 Kb DNA probe directly fluorescence labelled with Spectrum Orange. The probe is specific for the HER2 gene locus  17q11.2-q12.  In  addition  to  the  HER2  specific  probe,  this  assay  also  includes  another DNA probe, which is labelled with Spectrum Green and specific for the centromere region of chromosome 17 (17p11.1-q11.1) known as the CEP17 probe.



- HER2 scoring is based on the ratio of the average number of HER2 and CEP17 gene copy signals observed per nucleus with a signal ratio of GLYPH&lt;31&gt;GLYPH&lt;31&gt; 2.0 considered to indicate HER2 amplification.





- -HER2 FISH pharmDx™Kit (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) employs a ready-to-use FISH probe mix based on a combination of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and DNA technology. The probe mix consists of a mixture of Texas Redlabelled DNA probes covering a 218kb region including  the  HER2  gene  on  chromosome  17,  and  a  mixture  of  fluorescein-labelled  probes targeted at the centromeric region of chromosome 17 (CEN-17). The specific hybridisation to the two targets results in formation of a distinct red fluorescent signal at each HER2 gene locus and a distinct green fluorescent signal at each chromosome 17 centromere. Using a fluorescence microscope  equipped  with  appropriate  filters,  tumour  cells  are  located  and  counting  of  red (HER2) and green (CEN-17) signals is conducted. HER2/CEN-17 signal ratio GLYPH&lt;31&gt;GLYPH&lt;31&gt; 2.0 indicates HER2 amplification.
- -INFORM® HER2/neu Probe (for  use  with  the  Benchmark®  or  Benchmark  XT  automated slide  stainers;  Ventana  Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, USA) includes a biotin-labelled locusspecific  HER2 probe. The hybridized HER2 probe is detected by a ligand with a fluorescent label  which  binds  to  the  biotin  label  on  the  DNA  probe.  The  HER2  gene  copy  number  is enumerated  without  normalizing  for  chromosome  17  copy  number  since  the  INFORM HER2/neu Probe does not include a centromere control probe. A HER2 gene copy number &gt; 4 has  been  established  as  the  optimum  cut-point  to  differentiate  amplified  versus  nonamplified samples.

## CISH assays for detecting HER2 gene amplification

- -Zymed SPOT-Light HER2 CISH Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, USA) includes a double-stranded DNA probe labelled with digoxigenin, which binds specifically to the HER2 gene locus on chromosome 17q12-21. CISH staining results may be assessed with a standard brightfield microscope after visualisation with the conventional peroxidase reactions. Tumour  cell  nuclei with HER2  gene  amplification  appear  as  large peroxidase-positive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intranuclear  gene  copy  clusters  or  as  numerous  individual  peroxidase-positive  small  signals, where &gt; 5 HER2 gene copies per nucleus in &gt;50% of cancer cells indicate amplification.

## Published Concordance 1 data

In  many  published  intra-laboratory  and  interlaboratory  studies  the  HER2  status  on  the  same  breast cancer samples was assessed by IHC, FISH, and CISH in order to compare the results obtained with different  methodologies  directly.    The  MAH  has  performed  a  literature  search  and  collected publications  (from  peer  reviewed  journals  as  well  as  abstracts)  with  IHC/FISH,  IHC/CISH,  and/or FISH/CISH  concordance  data.  Only  studies  fulfilling  the  predefined  selection  criteria  have  been selected (Table 1).

The studies were analysed in line with the Herceptin marketing authorisation such that a negative IHC result represents scores of IHC 0, 1+, and 2+, while a positive result represents a score of IHC 3+.

Whether  a  new  methodology  is  reliable  can  be  assessed  by  a  direct  comparison  of  the  testing methodology  against  the  established'standard'  methodology,  which  is  IHC  for  HER2  testing. Therefore  the  following  comparisons  were  conducted:  IHC/FISH,  IHC/CISH,  and  FISH/CISH  by analysing the data extracted from the literature.

The data presented indicate that there is a good agreement between the different methodologies. In nearly all (24/25) studies the results of IHC and FISH were comparable and thus concordance rates between  86%  and  98%.  Only  in  one  study  20  samples  were  assessed  as  IHC  negative  but  FISH positive so that the concordance rate decreased to 70%. The calculated sensitivities and specificities ranged  from  0.72  to  1.00  and  0.62  to  1.00,  respectively,  indicating  very  good  concordance  and agreement between IHC and FISH.

## IHC/CISH concordance data

The results of the comparison IHC/CISH are presented in table 3. Although the concordance data are high with &gt;80% in 16 out of 17 studies, they are slightly lower in comparison with the IHC/FISH data. Nevertheless, as concordance data above 80% are accepted to demonstrate a good agreement between two methodologies, it can be concluded that also CISH is a suitable method to assess the HER2 status of a patient.

Additionally  the  calculated  sensitivities  and  specificities  also  indicated  a  good  agreement  between both methodologies.

## FISH/CISH concordance data

A comparison of the methodologies determining the gene amplification indicates a very strong agreement between the two methods (table 4).

## Overview of recommendations and guidelines

In  many  countries  HER2  testing  recommendations  and  guidelines  already  exist.  They  are  useful  to standardize testing procedures and to improve accuracy of test results and interpretation.

European countries recommending FISH in addition to IHC as a HER2 methodology:

- -Published  HER2  testing  guidelines  recommending  FISH  as  an  appropriate  methodology  to assess the HER2 status of breast cancer samples: France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
- -No published guidelines, but local pathology groups recommend the use of FISH in addition to IHC: Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Slovak Republic, and Spain.
- -No published guidelines but at least 1 reference laboratory where FISH is established and used for routine clinical assessment of HER2: Belgium, Greece, Hungary, and Portugal.
- -Currently IHC use only, FISH not established: Latvia.

## European countries recommending CISH as a HER2 testing methodology:

- -CISH instead of FISH for use in routine clinical practice in addition to IHC: Finland
- -CISH in addition to FISH and IHC: Slovak Republic
- -CISH routinely used: Greece, Portugal, and Italy.
- -CISH might be used for routine clinical practice in the near future: France, Germany, Greece, and Sweden.

Although  in  routine  clinical  practice  IHC  is  the  most  commonly  used  methodology  for  testing  the HER2 status, the FISH test is used in approximately 16% of all MBC patients in Western Europe, to test the eligibility for Herceptin therapy.  The use of CISH as a diagnostic tool for HER2 testing is also supposed to increase in the near future, due to its excellent performance and its proven reliability.

## Overall discussion

In  the  majority  of  countries  IHC  is  no  longer  the  only  methodology  for  assessing  HER2  status  of breast  cancer  patients.  This  is  reflected  in  national  and  international  HER2  testing  guidelines recommending the use of FISH in addition to IHC specimens. In routine clinical practice CISH gains more and more importance and in Finland has already superseded FISH for HER2 testing.

In order to reflect this diagnostic development in the SPC presented concordance studies (IHC/FISH, IHC/CISH,  FISH/CISH)  and  statistical  analyses  performed  out  of  published  literature  data  were presented. These data have demonstrated that the results of the diagnostic methodologies FISH and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CISH are accurate, reliable and robust.  There is a strong association between HER2 overexpression and HER2 gene amplification demonstrating that direct determination of the HER2 gene copy number offers  a  valid  alternative  for  assessing  HER2  positivity.  Thus  FISH  or  CISH  can  be  used  for  either primary HER2 testing or for re-testing cases for which the initial test result is difficult to interpret.

Specific  characteristics  of  the  different  diagnostic  methodologies  including  the  interpretation  of  the test results are adequately addressed. In clinical practise, the quality of HER2 testing will depend on a good validation of the test methodology in the laboratories and an intra- and interlaboratory quality control and quality assurance.

There  is  ongoing  scientific  discussion  about  C/FISH  methods  and  their  concordance  with  (1) immunohistochemistry (IHC; can be negative despite positive IHC and vice versa) and (2) prediction of clinical response. Discussion on this concordance is controversial. The initial marketing authorization for Herceptin included data from a rather small study that showed a clinical benefit only in  patients  with  strong  overexpression  of  HER2  (3+).  The  efficacy  database  has  not  changed  up  to now, and thus, this target population should be kept. However, the situation 'in the real world' might be different with various tests available. It might be considered if (1) the common approach should be undertaken to include any new method that emerges over time by an own type II variation, or (2) if in these sections a more general guidance could be given that gives a certain framework new methods have to stick to but would be allowed to be performed.

## Amendments to the SPC.

This  discussion  is  reflected  in  the  SPC  as  follows:  The  indication  section  of  the  SPC  includes  a statement: Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay and refers to 4.4 and 5.1  where  general  guidance  is  given.  The  guidance  is  strict  enough  to  preclude  use  of  this  drug  in patients with insufficient HER2 expression, since the risk-benefit ratio for these patients is critical due to considerable possible side effects of the drug.
