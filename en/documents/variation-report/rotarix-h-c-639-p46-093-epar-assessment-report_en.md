## 1. Introduction

On 29 August 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The initial due date of this submission was 18 September 2016. A letter informing of delay of this submission was sent to EMA on 16 September 2016, informing the EMA of the delay in the availability of the Clinical Study Report within 6 months from the last subject last visit, and hence a delay in this submission.

Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) is a phase IIIb, open, randomised, controlled, multicentre study conducted in the US to assess the co-administration of Rotarix with Hib-MenCY-TT (MenHibrix, GSK) at 2 and 4 months of age, the co-administration of Prevnar 13 (Pfizer) with Hib-MenCY-TT at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and the co-administration of Prevnar 13 and Havrix (GSK) with Hib-MenCY-TT at 12 to 15 months of age.

No changes to the Product Information of Rotarix are proposed.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation of Rotarix administered was the lyophilised formulation.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Following the introduction of Hib-conjugate and S. pneumoniae conjugate vaccines in the routine infant immunization schedule in the US, there has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of diseases caused by Hib and S. pneumoniae. Neisseria meningitidis has become a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the US, with serogroups B, C and Y being responsible for the majority of cases.

In 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the burden of meningococcal disease among infants and children aged 0-59 months. The number of US infants at increased risk for meningococcal disease is small (estimated at 3,000-5,000), making a targeted highrisk vaccination policy feasible and reasonable given the potential increased risk in these infants. In infants, not at increased risk for meningococcal disease, rates of this disease have declined in all age groups since 2000 and in 2011. The overall rate of meningococcal disease was at a historic low of 0.21 per 100,000 population. In the US, during 1993-2011, average annual rates of meningococcal disease were higher among children aged 0 through 59 months (1.74 per 100,000 population) than in adolescents aged 11 through 19 years (0.57 per 100,000). The epidemiology of meningococcal disease is dynamic, and rates of disease could increase in the future, requiring a reassessment of immunization strategy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Hib-MenCY-TT conjugate vaccine (MenHibrix) using Tetanus Toxoid (TT) as the carrier protein for the Hib and the meningococcal components was developed to be administered as a 4-dose vaccination series at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. On June 14th, 2012, MenHibrix was approved by the FDA for use in infants. This vaccine is anticipated to allow vaccination against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease without increasing the number of injections required to fully vaccinate a child according to the routine childhood schedule in the US.

The MAH submitted a final report for Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) which aims to demonstrate the acceptability of the co-administration of Rotarix, Prevnar 13 and Havrix with GSK's Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine. Rotarix was administered to both study groups at month 0 and 2.

The first primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of anti-PRP concentration of a 4-dose vaccination course of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix compared to a 3-dose vaccination course of PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix. The other primary confirmatory objectives was to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of Rotarix IgA GMCs, S. pneumoniae GMCs and anti-HAV concentrations.

The study was initiated on 19-February-2014 and completed on 18-March-2016. The data lock point was on 16-March-2018.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931): A phase IIIb, open, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to assess the coadministration of Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals') with Hib-MenCY-TT (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' Meningococcal Groups C and Y and Haemophilus b Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine) at 2 and 4 months of age, the co-administration of Prevnar 13 (Pfizer) with HibMenCY-TT at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and the co-administration of Prevnar 13 and Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals') with Hib-MenCY-TT at 12 to 15 months of age.

## Methods

## Objectives

Before concluding on the primary objectives for Rotarix, Prevnar 13, and Havrix, the following objective was to be reached:

Co-primary objectives

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a four dose vaccination course of Hib-MenCY-TT coadministered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix compared to a three dose vaccination course of PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix in terms of anti-PRP concentration.

Criterion for non-inferiority (1 month post dose 4) : Lower limit of the standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the difference (HibCY group minus the PedHIB group) in the percentage of subjects with anti-PRP concentrations ≥1.0 µg/mL is ≥-10% (clinical limit for noninferiority).

To conclude independently on the following primary objectives of Epoch 001 or Epoch 002, a Bonferroni correction was to be used to evaluate these objectives (2.5% two-sided for Epoch 001 and 2.5% two-sided for Epoch 002). As per the hierarchical procedure, the first primary objective would have to be reached to conclude on the second primary objective of that Epoch.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Epoch 001:

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 2-dose primary vaccination course of Rotarix coadministered with Hib-MenCY-TT, Pediarix and Prevnar 13 compared to that of Rotarix coadministered with PedvaxHIB, Pediarix and Prevnar 13 in terms of Rotarix IgA GMCs.

Criteria for non-inferiority (2 months post-dose 2) : Lower limit of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 97.5% CI on the ratio of anti-rotavirus IgA GMC (HibCY group over PedHIB group) ≥ 0.5 (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 3-dose primary vaccination course of Prevnar 13 co administered with Hib-MenCY-TT, Rotarix and Pediarix compared to that of Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB, Rotarix and Pediarix in terms of S. pneumoniae GMCs.

Criteria for non-inferiority (1 month after the third dose) : Lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% CI on the GMC ratio (HibCY group over PedHIB group) for antibodies to S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F is ≥ 0.5 (clinical limit for noninferiority).

## Epoch 002:

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 2-dose vaccination course of Havrix when the first dose is co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT and Prevnar 13 at 12 to 15 months of age compared to that of Havrix when the first dose is co-administered with PedvaxHIB and Prevnar 13 at 12 to 15 months of age.

Criteria for non-inferiority (1 month after the second Havrix vaccination) : Lower limit of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 97.5% CI on the difference (HibCY group minus the PedHIB group) in the percentage of subjects with anti-HAV concentrations ≥ 15 mIU/mL is ≥ -10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

- -To demonstrate the non-inferiority of a 4-dose vaccination course of Prevnar 13 coadministered with Hib-MenCY-TT and Havrix compared to that of Prevnar 13 co-administered with PedvaxHIB and Havrix in terms of S. pneumoniae GMCs.

Criteria for non-inferiority (1 month after the fourth dose) : Lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% CI on the GMC ratio (HibCY group over PedHIB group) for antibodies to S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F is ≥0.5 (clinical limit for noninferiority).

## Secondary objectives

## Immunogenicity:

- -To evaluate the anti-PRP immune response 2 months post-dose 2 (PedHIB group only), 1 month post-dose 3 and 1 month post-dose 4 (HibCY group only) after Hib-MenCY-TT or PedvaxHIB vaccination.
- -To evaluate hSBA-MenC and hSBA-MenY immune response 1 month post-dose 3 and 1 month post-dose 4 after Hib-MenCY-TT or PedvaxHIB vaccination.
- -To evaluate anti-rotavirus IgA immune response 2 months after the 2nd dose of Rotarix vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -To evaluate anti-S. pneumoniae immune response above thresholds 1 month post-dose 3 and 1 month post-dose 4 after Prevnar 13 vaccination.
- -To evaluate anti-HAV immune response 1 month post-dose 1 and 1 month post-dose 2 after Havrix vaccination.

## Safety:

- -To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Rotarix, Pediarix and Prevnar 13 and of PedvaxHIB co-administered with Rotarix, Pediarix and Prevnar 13.
- -To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Havrix and Prevnar 13 and of PedvaxHIB co-administered with Havrix and Prevnar 13.

## Study design

Study Hib-MenCY-TT-016 (112931) is a Phase IIIB, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-centric, single-country study with two parallel groups as presented in the figure below.

<!-- image -->

*BS = Bloodsample

The duration of the study was 17-20 months:

- -Epoch 001: starting at Visit 1 (Day 0) and ending at the day preceding Visit 5 (Month 10-13, fourth dose vaccination)
- -Epoch 002: starting at Visit 5 (Month 10-13) and ending at Visit 8 (Month 17-20, 31 days after the 2nd Havrix vaccination).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

The study population involved healthy infants between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks years of age at the time of the first vaccination, born after a gestation period of 37 weeks, who had not received vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rotavirus, pneumococcus, hepatitis A and/or poliovirus and who had not received more than one previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine which had to be administered at least 30 days prior to enrolment.

Subjects with history of intussusceptions or uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusceptions were excluded from enrolment.

## Blinding

This study was conducted in an open manner, since the presentation and number of vaccines to be administered per visit differed for each group. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing was blinded to the treatment, and codes were used to link the subject and study (without any link to the treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample.

## Treatments

600 subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either HibCY or PedHIB groups:

- -HibCY group : Hib-MenCY-TT, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix + Rotarix at Months 0, 2 ; Hib-MenCYTT, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix at Month 4; Hib-MenCY-TT, Prevnar 13 + Havrix at Month 10-13; and Havrix at Month 16-19.
- -PedHIB group : PedvaxHIB, Prevnar 13 + Pediarix + Rotarix at Months 0, 2 ; Prevnar 13 + Pediarix at Month 4; PedvaxHIB, Prevnar 13 + Havrix at Month 10-13; and Havrix at Month 16-19.

At enrolment, the subjects were associated to one of the three blood sampling schedules:

- -The first 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 3 with a blood draw one month post-third dose at Month 5 (Visit 4), one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6) and one month after the second Havrix vaccination (Visit 8).
- -The next 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 2 with a blood draw before the third vaccination dose at Month 4 (Visit 3), one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6) and one month after the second Havrix vaccination (Visit 8)
- -The last 200 subjects were enrolled in the blood sample sub-cohort 1 with a blood draw before the third vaccination dose at Month 4 (Visit 3), one month post-third dose at Month 5 (Visit 4) and one month post-fourth dose (Visit 6).

## Safety and Reactogenicity

- -Occurrence of each solicited adverse event 4 days (Day 0 to Day 3) after all vaccines postprimary and post-fourth dose.
- o Local symptoms
- o General symptoms
- -Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms 31 days (Day 0 to Day 30) after all vaccines post-primary and post-fourth dose.
- -Occurrence throughout the study of SAEs from Day 0 to study end.

## Statistical Methods

Demographic characteristics (age at each dose in weeks, gender, geographical ancestry, ethnicity, height [cm], weight [kg], body mass index [BMI in kg/m²] at first dose, subcohort, vaccination history, center), timing between Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine constitution and vaccination at each dose, cohort description and withdrawal status were summarised by group using descriptive statistics:

- -Frequency tables were generated for categorical variables such as geographical ancestry or timing between Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine constitution and vaccination;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Mean, median and standard error were provided for continuous data such as age.
- -The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study sites was tabulated as a whole and per group.

## Analysis of immunogenicity:

The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the ATP cohorts for immunogenicity. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of enrolled subjects with serological results excluded from this ATP cohort was more than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort was performed to support the ATP analysis.

## Within groups assessment

For each treatment group and for each antibody assessed at the corresponding timepoint:

- -Percentage of subjects with antibody concentration or titre ≥ endpoint specific threshold value with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
- -Geometric Mean antibody Concentrations or Titres (GMCs or GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated.

The above analyses were performed by gender and geographical ancestry. In addition, antibody concentrations or titres were evaluated using reverse cumulative curves (RCC) for each antibody assessed.

## Between groups assessment

Non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT post-dose 4 when co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix compared to PedvaxHIB post-dose 3 co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix with respect to antiPRP was evaluated through:

- -Computation of the asymptotic standardized 95.0% CIs for the difference in the percentage of subjects with anti-PRP ≥ 1.0 μg/ml (HibCY group minus the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 4th dose of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccination and 1 month after the 3rd dose of PedvaxHIB vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix versus PedvaxHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13 and Havrix was to be a lower limit of the 95.0% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%.

Non-inferiority of Rotarix when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Rotarix coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-Rota IgA was evaluated through:

- -Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with antiRota IgA (HibCY group over the PedHIB group) 2 months after the 2nd dose of Rotarix vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Rotarix co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus Rotarix coadministered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5.

Non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F was evaluated through:

- -Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with antiS. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (HibCY group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

over the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 3rd dose of Prevnar 13 vaccination. Indication of noninferiority of Prevnar 13 co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5.

Non-inferiority of Havrix when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Havrix coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti-HAV was evaluated through:

- -Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the difference in the percentage of subjects with anti-HAV ≥15 mIU/mL (HibCY group rate minus PedHIB group rate) one month after primary vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Hib-MenCY-TT was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%.

Non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 when co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT compared to Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB with respect to anti- S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F were to be evaluated through:

- -Computation of the asymptotic standardized 97.5% CIs for the GMC ratio of subjects with antiS. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (HibCY group over the PedHIB group) 1 month after the 4th dose of Prevnar 13 vaccination. Indication of non-inferiority of Prevnar 13 co-administered with Hib-MenCY-TT versus Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB was to be a lower limit of the 97.5% CI greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of 0.5.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 600 subjects who were vaccinated in the 27 study centers in the US, 462 completed the study (232 in HibCY group and 230 in group PedHIB group). A total of 138 subjects (65 in HibCY group and 73 in group PedHIB group) were withdrawn from the study. The main reasons for withdrawal were: consent withdrawal (not due to an adverse event), migrated/moved from study area, and lost to follow-up (subjects with incomplete vaccination course).

## Assessor's comment

The immunogenicity profile of Rotarix is consistent with earlier data.

## Safety results

## Solicited adverse events

Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in both groups (in 90.9% of the subjects in HibCY group and 94.9% of the subjects in PedHIB group [after 69.1% and 78.4% of doses,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively]). Grade 3 irritability was reported in 14.0% of the subjects of HibCY and 22.4% of the subjects of PedHIB group [after 5.9% and 10.4% of doses, respectively]. All other grade 3 solicited general symptoms were reported in 10.8% or fewer subjects (5.4% or fewer doses). Most of the reported grade 3 solicited general symptoms were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination.

## Serious adverse events (SAEs)

Overall, 19 subjects reported SAEs from dose 1 up to study end: 8 (2.7%) in HibCY group, and 11 (3.6%) in PedHIB group. All SAEs were considered by the investigator as not causally related to the vaccination.

One death (sudden infant death syndrome) was reported in the HibCY group (158 days after post-dose 3). This event was considered by the investigator as not causally related to the vaccination.

Adverse events led to premature discontinuation/withdrawal from the study in 6 subjects (1 death [sudden infant death syndrome] in the HibCY group and 5 nonfatal SAEs in PedHIB group).

## Assessor's comment

Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently.

No new safety events were reported.

The safety and reactogenicity results were consistent with the known safety profile of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The current study evaluated the immunogenicity of Rotarix when administered according to a 2-dose schedule in 6-12 weeks old subjects in 27 study centres in the US. Rotarix was co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and either Hib-MenCY-TT or Hib vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All the co-primary objectives of the study were met as the pre-defined criteria have been reached. Since the first primary objective for Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine with respect to the percentage of subjects with anti-PRP concentration was met, the rest of the co-primary objectives for Rotarix, Prevnar 13, and Havrix were also assessed and these were equally met.

Anti-rotavirus IgA concentrations ≥ 20 U/mL was observed in at least 81.3% of subjects in the HibCY group and 80.1% of subjects in the PedHIB group.

The immunogenicity profile of Rotarix is consistent with earlier data.

Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently, but no new safety events were reported.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

This study investigated the acceptability of the co-administration of Rotarix, Prevnar 13 and Havrix with the candidate Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine.

The non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Rotarix and Prevnar 13 when co-administered with HibMenCY-TT as compared to the immunogenicity of Rotarix and Prevnar 13 co-administered with USlicensed PedvaxHIB and the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of Havrix and Prevnar 13 when coadministered with Hib-MenCY-TT as compared to the immunogenicity of Havrix and Prevnar 13 coadministered with PedvaxHIB, were demonstrated.

Rotarix was administered to both study groups and co-administered with other study vaccines. The safety and reactogenicity profile of Rotarix could therefore not be assessed independently, but no new safety events were reported.

Based on the presented immunogenicity and safety results the benefit risk balance for Rotarix remains positive. The presented data support the previously presented data. No regulatory action is considered necessary based on the current study results.
