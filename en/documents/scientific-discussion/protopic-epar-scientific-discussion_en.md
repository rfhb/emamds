## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Protopic. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 October 2003. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## Introduction

The active substance of Protopic 0.03% ointment and Protopic 0.1% ointment is tacrolimus (FK506). One gram of Protopic 0.03% ointment contains 0.3 mg of tacrolimus (as monohydrate). One gram of Protopic 0.1% ointment contains 1.0 mg of tacrolimus (as monohydrate).

Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant with which there are many years of clinical experience in  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  organ  transplant  rejection.  A  topical  formulation  has  been developed for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Tacrolimus  0.03%  and  0.1%  ointment  are  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies. Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children who failed to respond adequately to conventional therapies.

In adults (16 years of age and above), treatment should be started with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice a  day  for  up  to  three  weeks.  Afterwards  the  strength  should  be  reduced  to  0.03%  twice  a  day.  An attempt  should  be  made  to  reduce  the  frequency  of  application  if  the  clinical  condition  allows. Treatment should be continued until clearance of the lesion.

In  children  (2  years  of  age  and  above),  only  the  0.03%  strength  is  indicated,  treatment  should  be started twice a day for up to three weeks. Afterwards the frequency of application should be reduced to once a day until clearance of the lesion.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease, frequently seen in patients with a personal or family  history of atopic diseases. Acute  AD  is  characterised  by  intensely  pruritic, erythematous papules that are associated with excoriations, erosions and serous exudates.  Chronic AD is characterised by thickened skin with accentuated markings (lichenification) and fibrotic papules.  During infancy, AD primarily involves the face, scalp and extensor surfaces of the extremities.  In older patients, the flexural folds of the extremities are the predominant location for lesions.

Current management of AD involves hydration of the skin, the use of emollients and avoidance of skin irritants. Topical corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pruritus and are useful in controlling acute flares. Antihistamines are used to control pruritus.  For patients with severe disease, resistant to topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, phototherapy (UVA and UVB), and systemic cyclosporin are utilised. Patients with AD have an increased susceptibility to a variety of microbial agents and topical or  occasionally  systemic  antibiotics  may  be  required  to  treat  infection.  Due  to  limited  efficacy  and adverse effects of current therapies, there is a need for a treatment for AD that is effective in severe disease, with a low potential for side effects with long-term use.

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The product contains tacrolimus in an oil-in-oil (o/o) ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The dossier was of good quality and no major queries arose from the initial assessment.

## Composition

The ointment contains 0.03 % or 0.1 % of tacrolimus in an o/o ointment, which includes propylene carbonate and standard ointment excipients. Although propylene carbonate is not a common excipient, it is  included  in  the  US  National  Formulary  and  also  in  an  FDA  Inactive  Ingredients  Guide  for  topical preparations according to the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients.

## Active substance

Tacrolimus  is  not  described  in  a  pharmacopoeia.    The  specification  proposed  includes  tests  for identification, optical rotation, assay, related substances, residual solvents and general relevant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacopoeial purity tests.  The related substances limits have either been justified with reference to toxicological  studies,  and/or  reduced.  Tacrolimus  is  derived  from  the  fermentation  of Streptomyces Tsukubaensis, followed by extraction and purification of the active substance.  Proof of structure has been demonstrated by the usual range of spectroscopic techniques.

## Stability of the active substance

Three commercial-scale batches were stored in triple PE bags at 30°C for 24 months (one batch) and 36 months (two batches) and at 40°C/75 % RH for six months.  Three pilot batches were stored in open Petri dishes at 30°C/75 % RH for three months and under 1000 lux light conditions for 50 days.  The results show that active is stable under long-term and accelerated conditions and shows no instability to light and moisture.  The re-test period of 24 months, with no storage restrictions, is acceptable.

## Other ingredients

Excipients comply with BP, PhEur or US National Formulary monographs, as appropriate.  Other than white beeswax which has no known TSE risk, no other ingredient of animal origin is used.

## Product development and finished product

A topical  product  was  developed  as  tacrolimus  was  expected  to  exert  a  local  effect  with  reduced  side effects.    The  development  of  the  ointment  included  studies  of  solubility,  pharmacological  activity  and dermal  absorption  with  suitable  solvents  for  the  drug  substance,  and  optimisation  studies  of  ointment consistency (rheology) with various proportions of paraffins.   The choice of excipients and quantities used have been adequately described and justified.

The  0.03  %  ointment  was  tested  and  found  to  meet  the  PhEur.  requirements  for  Antimicrobial Preservation, thus no preservative was added.

Manufacture of the ointment is carried out by Fujisawa Healthcare, in Grand Island, NY.  The process consists of three stages: dissolution of tacrolimus, mixing of the resulting solution with a solution of base ingredients, and finally homogenisation of the ointment and cooling.  Key steps have been optimised and the process was  validated  with  data  on nine  commercial  batches.  Validation  results  show  that homogenisation, storage and filling of the ointment does not have any adverse impact on the homogeneity of content throughout the tube and on droplet size.

The finished  product specification  includes  appearance,  assay, related  substances  tests,  droplet  size,  as well  as  a  test  for  consistency  and  homogeneity  of  the  ointment.    Related  substances  limits  have  been satisfactorily justified and/or amended.

## Stability of the Product

Three production-scale batches of each strength in the 30 g and 60 g market pack size were stored for 36 months at 25°C/60 % RH, 12 months at 30°C/60 % RH and six months at 40°C/75 % RH.  Three production-scale batches of each strength in the 10 g market pack size were stored for 12 months at 25°C/60 % RH and 12 months at 30°C/60 % RH. The stability study for the 10 g will be continued until  completion  at  36  months.  A  freeze-thaw  study  was  also  conducted.    On  storage,  tacrolimus content declines over time and the levels of some related substances increase, but this is justified with reference  to  toxicological  arguments.  Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Pivotal studies were conducted under GLP guidelines.

## Pharmacodynamics

Atopic  dermatitis  (AD)  is  a  chronic,  recurring  inflammatory  skin  disease  of  uncertain  aetiology.  An increased  number  of  antigen  presenting  dendritic  cells,  lymphocytes,  macrophages,  mast  cells  and eosinophils  are  found  in  lesional  skin.  The  presence  of  activated  T-helper  cells,  and  the  cytokines produced, appears to be important in both the initiation and chronic phases of AD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro studies on various cells (T cells, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, Langerhans cells) and in vivo studies in animal models of allergic and spontaneous dermatitis were carried out to explore the pharmacodynamic effects of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis (AD).

- In vitro studies

In vitro studies demonstrate a marked effect of tacrolimus on T helper cells, human peripheral blood eosinophils  and  human  epidermal  Langerhans  cells.  Cytokine  production  by  T  cells  from  human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse spleen cells was about equally inhibited by tacrolimus and  betamethasone.    Langerhans  cells,  cultured  in  the  presence  of  tacrolimus  or  betamethasone, reduced the stimulation of allogeneic T cells dose-dependently.

Via  its  binding  to  a  specific  cytoplasmic  immunophilin  (FKBP12),  tacrolimus  inhibits  calciumdependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNFα and IFNγ .

## · In vivo studies

Tacrolimus  ointment  (up  to  1%)  showed  no  effect  on  the  early  phase  of  the  immediate  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  mice  (passive  cutaneous,  ascaris  antigen-induced  peak  ear  oedema  1  hr  after injection), but inhibited the late phase reaction (peak ear edema 24 h after injection); both reactions were  inhibited  by  betamethasone  ointment.  Tacrolimus  did  not  inhibit  eosinophil  or  CD4 + T  cell infiltration  in  the  late  phase  reaction,  while  betamethasone  did.  The  delayed  type  hypersensitivity reactions  in  mice  (tuberculin-induced  and  oxazolone-induced-contact  delayed  type  hypersensitivity) were somewhat less affected by tacrolimus ointment than betamethasone ointment.  In a mouse model of spontaneous dermatitis the effects of tacrolimus ointment inhibited the development of dermatitis, whilst steroid ointments had a marginal effect.

In general, in terms of the inhibition immune-mediated inflammation (i.e. delayed type hypersensitivity and late phase responses), tacrolimus ointment appeared to be somewhat less effective than glucocorticoid ointment.

## · Pharmacodynamic/kinetic drug interactions

No  topical  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  tacrolimus.  Tacrolimus  was  practically  not metabolised in vitro by human skin microsomes. Systemic exposure to topical tacrolimus is anticipated to be lower than that known with oral or intravenous exposure for which clinical experience outweighs pre-clinical experimental evidence.

## · General and safety pharmacology programme

General pharmacological studies with tacrolimus were performed at doses up to 32 mg/kg orally or 3.2 mg/kg intravenously. Tacrolimus had no outstanding acute effects on the autonomic or motor nervous system,  smooth  muscle,  kidney  function  or  the  haematological  system;  short-term  continuous intravenous  administration  of  tacrolimus  affected  the  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  system,  and, albeit mildly, the central nervous and digestive system.

Systemic exposure to topical tacrolimus is anticipated to be low (see pharmacokinetics), therefore, acute systemic side effects are not anticipated with the use of tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of AD.

## · Summary of salient findings

Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant with which there are many years of clinical experience with oral and intravenous formulation for the prevention and treatment of organ transplant rejection. Preclinical studies have been conducted which demonstrate some pharmacological activity of tacrolimus in a topical  formulation  for  the  treatment  of  atopic  dermatitis,  but  the  detailed  mechanism  of  action  of tacrolimus  in  atopic  dermatitis  is  not  known.  Because  systemic  exposure  to  topical  tacrolimus  is anticipated to be low, acute systemic side effects and drug interactions are not expected with the use of tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of AD.

## Pharmacokinetics

Eight  studies  of  tacrolimus  ointment  have  been  conducted  to  define  the  pharmacokinetics  or toxicokinetics  of  tacrolimus  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  or  micropig  models.  One in  vitro study  of  the metabolism of 14 C-tacrolimus by rat skin microsomes was also conducted. In several of toxicological

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies  whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus were also determined as part of their evaluations. Tacrolimus concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay and liquid scintillation counting.

Topical administration pharmacokinetic studies suggest that absorption of tacrolimus is low, but highly variable.  Tacrolimus  does  not  penetrate  beyond  the  epidermis  to  a  significant  extent  in  intact  skin (absolute  bioavailability:  4.7%  in  rat,  14.7%  in  rabbit,  0.94%  in  micro-pig).  Penetration  is  higher  in damaged skin (62.4% in the rat), as may be the case with AD lesions. In general, plasma levels increase with dose following oral and topical administration, nevertheless, there were some unexplained apparent changes  in  absorption  with  time  which  should  not  result  in  any  adverse  clinical  impact.  Systemically tacrolimus distributes widely and is almost completely metabolised by microsomal enzymes in the liver, metabolism in the skin is minimal.  Excretion of tacrolimus is primarily via the bile and faeces. After systemic administration, tacrolimus crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

Tacrolimus ointment was applied to the shaved intact or abraded skin of rats at doses of up to 80 mg tacrolimus/kg, no death and no irritation or other dermal changes were seen.

## · Repeated dose toxicity

Two dermal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  the  rat.  In  the  4  week  study,  0-0(vehicle)-0.1-0.3-1% ointment (corresponding to 0-0(vehicle)-2-6-20 mg/kg tacrolimus) were applied daily to shaved, intact or abraded  dorsal  skin  (10%  body  surface  area  (BSA))  for  6  hours  a  day.    In  the  26  week  study,  00(vehicle)-0.03-0.1-0.3-0.5% ointment (corresponding to 0-0(vehicle)-0.6-2-6-10 mg/kg tacrolimus) were applied daily to shaved, intact dorsal skin (10% BSA) for 6 hours a day. Adverse effects were dose and time  related.    Mortality  in  the  groups  at  26  weeks  was  7.5-12.5-10.0-0-22.5-27.5%,  respectively. Principal adverse effects were: Skin - epithelial hyperplasia/acanthosis at the application site; Lymphoid low white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts, thymus, spleen and lymph node atrophy; Renal increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low K+, tubular basophilia, vacuolation and mineralisation; Blood - high RBC, low platelets; Pancreatic - islet cell vacuolation.  After 26 weeks a dose related increase of lens opacities was noted (2.7-2.9-2.8-7.5-9.4-44.8%). The topical NOEL was calculated as 2 mg/kg/day tacrolimus for 4 weeks or 0.6 mg/kg/day tacrolimus for 26 weeks.

Two  dermal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  the  Yucatan  micro-pig.    In  the  13  week  study,  00(vehicle)-0.1-0.3-1-3%  ointment  (corresponding  to  approximately  0-0(vehicle)-0.8-2.3-7.8-23.3  mg/kg tacrolimus) were applied twice daily to shaved, intact, unoccluded dorsal skin (40% BSA). In the 52 week study, an additional low dose group received 0.03% tacrolimus ointment twice daily (corresponding to approximately  0.2  mg/kg).    There  were  no  treatment  related  deaths.    All  treated  animals  had  dermal papules, oedema, erythema, purple ring, hypopigmentation, multi-focal acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, mild chronic inflammation.  Occasional increases in urinary K+ and decreased body weight gain in females at 3% ointment  were  also  noted.  Signs  were  in  all  treated  groups,  there  was  no  dose  relationship  and  a NOEL was not established. However, systemic exposure was lower in this species than in the rat.

In addition, data were provided from oral (13 weeks and 52 weeks) and intravenous (4 weeks) toxicity studies in rat and in baboon.

## · Reproduction studies

A  standard  series  of  reproduction  toxicity  studies  was  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits  using  the  oral preparation. High doses were associated with: poor weight gain; reduced mating behaviour; prolonged diestrus; delayed parturition; increased pre-and post-implantation losses; reduced pup viability, failure to thrive (delayed testes descent); increased F1 variations and malformations (with relatively high incidence of ventricular septal defect).  There was no effect on the developmental or mating parameters of those pups  that  survived  to  weaning.  The  maximum  non-toxic  dose  levels  were  considered  to  be  0.32 mg/kg/day and 0.1 mg/kg/day tacrolimus in rats and rabbits respectively.

Although dermal absorption in humans is unlikely to produce the systemic levels of tacrolimus seen in these studies, the use of tacrolimus ointment in pregnancy or lactation is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Genotoxic potential

A standard series of genotoxicity studies, as per ICH guidelines, was conducted for tacrolimus.  An Ames test and a mammalian chromosome aberration assay were conducted for the main degradation product. Overall, neither tacrolimus nor the degradation product caused genotoxic effects.

## · Carcinogenic potential

Two  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice.  B6C3F1  mice,  50/sex/group,  received  00(vehicle)-0.03-0.1-0.3-1-3% ointment (corresponding to approximately 0-0(vehicle)-1-3.3-10-33-100 mg/kg/day tacrolimus) for 104 weeks, applied topically to shaved intact skin over 40% of the total body surface area. The ointment remained on the skin for 24 hours and was wiped off prior to the next application. The animals were individually housed and were not collared during exposure, thus raising the possibility of oral ingestion.  There was a dose related increase in mortality (17-15-22-59-85-100100%), survival was insufficient for histopathological analysis in the top three doses.  Principal lesions were  treatment  site  inflammation  and  acanthosis,  increased  bone  marrow  myelopoiesis,  cardiac degeneration and lymphoma.  The incidence of these lesions followed the pattern of those found in the untreated mouse, but with increased frequency. An increased incidence of lymphoma was observed in animals  treated  with  0.1%  tacrolimus.  This  is  consistent  with  the  immunosuppressive  action  of tacrolimus, most immunosuppressants are known to increase the incidence of lymphoma.  In a second study, CD-1 BR mice received dietary dosing of up to 3 mg/kg tacrolimus. The pattern of lesions was similar to that observed in the dermal carcinogenicity study.

Two  carcinogenicity  (2  years)  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  by  dietary  administration  (As  the maximum  tolerated  dosage  was  not  reached  in  the  first  study,  a  second  carcinogenicity  study  was performed using higher dosages).  The dose ranges used were 0-1.25 mg/kg/day and 0-5 mg/kg/day. The maximal non-toxic dose level in the first study was considered to 0.2 mg/kg/day tacrolimus. The pattern of toxicity mirrored that already discussed under repeated dose toxicity studies. There was no significant increase in neoplastic lesions compared to control.  There was a slight fall in pancreatic islet cell and pituitary adenoma in treated rats.

## Photo-toxicity

Studies  were  conducted  to  examine  the  effects  of  light  on  adverse  event  profile/genotoxicity  of tacrolimus.

A standard  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay  was  conducted  in  which  half  the  plates  in  each  treatment group  were  exposed  to  UVA/B  of  different  intensities.  An  in  vitro  chromosome  aberration  assay  was conducted in a similar manner. In neither case was there any evidence of genotoxicity in the absence or presence of UVA/B.  In a photo-sensitisation assay, guinea pigs were exposed to topical tacrolimus and UVA  for  five  consecutive  days,  followed  three  weeks  later  by  a  challenge  test.  Although  moderate erythema was noted during the induction phase, there was no evidence of photo-sensitisation.

In  a  13  week  study,  albino,  hairless  mice  received  0-0(vehicle)-0.03-0.1-0.3-1.0-3.0%  tacrolimus ointment (2 mg ointment/cm 2 ), applied topically to 40% of the body surface area, 5 days/week, and a dose of UV radiation from a solar simulator, alternately before or after application of ointment. Skin irritation, erythema, oedema etc., was seen in all treated groups including vehicle, but was dose and time related in severity.  A subsequent 40-week study in albino, hairless mice used the same treatment regimen.

In a 52-week photocarcinogenicity study, albino hairless mice received 0-0(vehicle)-0.03-0.1-0.3-1% tacrolimus  ointment  (2  mg  ointment/cm 2 ),  applied  topically  to  20%  of  the  body  surface  area,  5 days/week, and a dose of UV radiation from a solar simulator, alternately before and after application of ointment. The treatment was maintained for 40 weeks; thereafter the animals were maintained for a further  12 weeks  without  any  treatment.  The  incidence  of  skin  reaction  was  increased  in  all  treated groups compared to sham control, in the absence of a dose relationship this appears to be a vehicle effect. The level of UV radiation used induces skin tumours in untreated mice, the highest dose group had significantly reduced onset time for tumours &gt;1mm. Time to tumour was significantly reduced in treated males compared to vehicle, but not in females. The number of tumours &gt;1mm per animal was increased in a dose related manner, vehicle compared to control and treated compared to vehicle (at 0.1% for males, 0.3% for females).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  underlying  mechanisms  may  be  a  systemic  immuno-suppression,  however  other  mechanisms (local effect) cannot be excluded. In addition, photocarcinogenicity has also been observed with the vehicle for which the possible responsible component could be the liquid paraffin.

Nevertheless, the predictivity of the rodent photocarcinogenicity model (e.g. the albino hairless mouse model) for the human situation is at present unclear. Depending on the conclusions of the efficacy in humans, a warning to prevent excessive exposure to ultraviolet light in the SPC may be sufficient.

## · Local tolerance

Single and repeated dose local tolerance studies were conducted in the rabbit.  Some inflammation, with acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, was noted after several weeks dosing.  Similar responses were seen in vehicle and treatment groups.  The suitability of the vehicle was questioned.  However, the reactions were not severe and tend to be self-limiting clinically.  An additional sensitisation study conducted in the guinea pig showed no apparent reaction to tacrolimus.

## · Special toxicity studies

## Degradation Compound

The principle degradation  compound of tacrolimus, found in the ointment, is called OD-1.  The acute toxicity of OD-1 is low. Application of OD-1 (1% ointment) to intact rabbit or rat's skin, in single and repeated doses (4 weeks) respectively, produced no local or systemic effect.  OD-1 is non-genotoxic in vitro . No additional health risk is anticipated from the presence of OD-1 in tacrolimus ointment.

## · Environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk is anticipated from the use of tacrolimus ointment.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

The minimum lethal dose in rats after a single application of tacrolimus ointment was &gt;80 mg/kg. In 4- and 26-week dermal toxicity studies in rats the NOAEL was 0.1 and 0.03% respectively (2 and 0.6 mg/kg/day).  No clear signs of systemic toxicity were seen in micro-pigs receiving tacrolimus at up to 3% topical (approximately 20 mg/kg/day), possibly due to the &gt;10-fold lower systemic exposure in micro-pigs than in rats.

Systemic  absorption  of  high  doses  tacrolimus  is  associated  with  a  pattern  of  toxicity  that  includes lymphoid depletion,  pancreatic,  renal  and  lenticular  changes,  atrophy  of  male  reproductive  organs  and adverse  effects  on  sperm  function.  Immuno-suppression  is  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  of tacrolimus, hence the lymphoid depletion.  Diabetogenic-like symptoms have been noted with tacrolimus. It appears that the exposure levels associated with these effects greatly exceed those anticipated clinically with topical application of tacrolimus. Nonetheless these effects should be mentioned in the SPC (section 5.3 on preclinical safety data).

The proposed formulation of tacrolimus ointment is locally irritating.  This may be due to the vehicle and an alternative was questioned, however the proposed formulation is acceptable because such effects are self-limiting in clinical use.

In a photocarcinogenicity study, tacrolimus shortened the latent period of UV-induced skin tumours beyond  the  vehicle  effect.  The  underlying  mechanisms  for  the  photocarcinogenicity  of  tacrolimus ointment  could  be  a  systemic  immuno-suppression,  but  a  contribution  from  constituents  of  the ointment vehicle (e.g. liquid paraffin) could not be ruled out. Although the predictivity of this hairless mouse model is uncertain  and  the  excipients  are  widely  used  in  dermatological  products,  a  risk  of phototoxicity in clinical use cannot be excluded.  Warnings should be included in the SPC to reduce the clinical risk (e.g. recommending reduced exposure to sunlight) and post-marketing monitoring of cutaneous malignancies should be planned.

A standard battery of genotoxicity studies was carried out with tacrolimus, which did not show genotoxic effects.

Reproduction  toxicity  studies  were  not  performed  with  tacrolimus  ointment.  Reproductive  and developmental  toxicity  as  well  as  teratogenic  effects  were  reported  in  oral  reproduction  toxicity studies. Although systemic absorption of tacrolimus from ointment is low, its use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## All studies are noted to have been performed to Good Clinical Practice.

The  clinical  development  of  tacrolimus  ointment  included  within-subject  patch  tests  in  healthy volunteers,  three  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  patients  with  AD,  four  phase  II  studies  carried  out  to assess the optimal dose/concentration of tacrolimus (two in children and two in adults), five phase III comparative studies (three in adult patients and two in children) and one phase III comparative study comparing the efficacy of once daily and twice daily 0.03% tacrolimus in children. Data from longterm safety studies and Japanese studies were also provided.

## Clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology programme for tacrolimus ointment included:

- -three  studies  with  pharmacological  parameters  in  AD  patients  (studies  97-0-030,  FG-506-06-17 and FG-506-06-12).
- -assessments of skin irritation, contact sensitisation, phototoxicity, photoallergy and photosensitisation in healthy subjects.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

A study (97-0-030) was performed using immunostaining of 16 cellular/cytokine  markers in lesion biopsies of 21 AD patients treated with tacrolimus (0.1% ointment) or triamcinolone acetonide (0.1% ointment) twice daily for three weeks to target lesion.  The pattern of changes in staining suggested that tacrolimus and triamcinolone may produce a similar clinical effect through different immunological mechanisms, but there were no definite conclusions on differences in the mechanism of action.

## · Dynamic studies:

## Tolerability in healthy subjects

Within-subject  patch  tests  were  conducted  in  healthy  subjects  to  assess  skin  irritation,  contact sensitisation, phototoxicity, photoallergy and photosensitisation.

In the above-mentioned studies in healthy adults, tacrolimus ointment (0.03%, 0.1%, 0.3%) was shown to be  mildly  irritating,  non-sensitising,  but  not  associated  with  photo-toxicity,  photo-allergy  and  photosensitisation.

## Secondary pharmacology

Immunocompetence was assessed in a phase III, open-label, long-term study (FG-506-06-12) in a subset of AD patients.  Recall antigen test and CD4 and CD8 counts did not change over time. However, recall antigen test is considered insensitive and only detects immunosuppression in a minority of patients with systemic immunosuppression. CD4 and CD8 counts only provide an estimate of T-cell function.  The immuno-competence study was performed in adult patients and data from a paediatric population are lacking. Testing of immunocompetence should have utilised methods considered satisfactory for the investigation of primary immunodeficiency by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). In the absence of these specific data, the assessment of reports of infections is of major importance.

In contrast to betamethasone valerate, tacrolimus (0.1% and 0.3%) had no effect on collagen synthesis markers or skin thickness (surrogate markers for skin atrophy) in a short-term (7 days) study (FG-50606-17) in 14 AD patients and 12 healthy volunteers. In preclinical models, reduction of skin thickness and skin atrophy were not observed.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · General:

The  pharmacokinetic  documentation  for  tacrolimus  ointment  consists  of  two in  vitro studies,  five pharmacokinetic studies involving 84 adult ( ≥ 16 years) and 28 paediatric (2-15 years) AD patients and data from 2015 patients enrolled in clinical efficacy and dose-finding studies.

Phase I  and  II  studies  in  the  US  utilised  a  validated  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA) which  was  modified  to  detect  the  low  concentrations  anticipated  following  topical  treatment  with tacrolimus. The limit of quantification (LQ) was 0.05 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL for the Phase III studies. In  the  European  Phase  II  and  III  studies,  a  High  Performance  Liquid  Chromatography  with  Mass Spectroscopy  (HPLC-MS/MS)  assay  was  utilised  (LQ:  0.025  ng/mL).  An  ELISA  was  used  in  the Japanese studies (LQ: 0.05 ng/mL-0.5 ng/mL). In the systemic circulation, tacrolimus binds strongly to  erythrocytes,  resulting  in  a  whole  blood  to  plasma  distribution  ratio  of  approximately  20:1. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are based on measurements in whole blood.

## In Vitro

The  rate  and  the  extent  of  penetration  of  tacrolimus  (0.03-0.5%)  through  intact  epidermis  (human cadaver skin preparations) increased with increasing concentrations of ointment, and penetration was approximately seven-fold higher in skin sections devoid of stratum corneum than in intact skin. A  study  using 14 C-tacrolimus  and  homogenates  from  two  female  cosmetic  surgery  donors  did  not show evidence of in vitro metabolism. The known hepatic M-I and M-II metabolites were not detected and recovery of radioactivity from the incubates was essentially complete.

## Adult Healthy Volunteers

In healthy volunteers, minimal or no systemic absorption was observed following single or repeated application of 0.03%, 0.1% or 0.3% tacrolimus ointment to 1000 cm 2 intact skin.  Of 14 subjects who participated,  a  distinct  blood  concentration  profile  (on  Day  14  with  0.3%  tacrolimus  ointment)  was found in only one subject (Cmax 0.127 ng/ml, t1/2  68.6 hours, AUC(0-24) 2.31 ng.h/ml).  It is noted that measurable levels of tacrolimus occurred only sporadically and the data was consistent with minimal absorption through intact skin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with Atopic Dermatitis

Patients with moderate to severe AD, ≥ 18 years old, received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment applied twice daily for 14 days.  Pharmacokinetic assessments were carried out on Day 1, 4, 14 and every 24 hours for an additional 6 days.

Systemic exposure (AUC0-12) increased from Day 1 to Day 4 and depended on the size of the treatment area.  AUC0-12 values on Day 14 were similar to those on Day 1.  At this time, lesions were essentially healed. In patients with highest BSA treated (&gt; 6000 - 10000 cm 2 ), AUC0-12 on Day 1, Day 4 and Day 14 were 4.8+6.3, 10.2+9.2, 5.4+2.8 ng.h/ml respectively. The mean elimination half-life of 70 to 79 hours  on  Day  14  is  longer  than  the  half-life  of  intravenously  administered  tacrolimus  (44  hours). Based  on in  vitro data  and  available in  vivo data,  the  apparent  long  half-life  following  repeated administration  is  \"absorption  rate  limited\"  (the  rate  and  extent  of  penetration  decreases  as  the  skin heals leading to a lower rate of absorption compared with the rate of elimination).  The long half-life reported in this study suggests that a longer dosing interval than the 12 hours used in most of the phase III clinical studies, could be appropriate.

In  addition  a  study  (FG01-506-09)  to  determine  the  distribution  of  tacrolimus  in  the  skin  of  adult patients  with  moderate  to  severe  atopic  dermatitis  following  first  and  repeated  application  of  0.1% tacrolimus  ointment  is  ongoing.  Interim  data  (10  of  16  patients)  demonstrate  accumulation  of tacrolimus in the skin following repeated administration and retention of measurable amounts in the skin in accordance with the long half-life in blood (70-80 hours).

In  a  European Paediatric  Pharmacokinetic  Study ,  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  AD,  6-12  years old, received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment applied twice daily for 14 days to &lt;1500 cm 2 , &gt;1500 to &lt;3000 cm 2 or  &gt;3000 to &lt;5000 cm 2 of  body surface area. Pharmacokinetic assessments were carried out on Day 1 and 14.  Systemic exposure was low (highest average systemic exposure observed: AUC0-12= 8,4 ng.h/ml). Average exposure was highest in patients who treated about half of their total body surface area. It is noted that this strength is not recommended for use in paediatric patients and only the lower strength (0.03%) will be used.

A pharmacokinetic study was not carried out in children aged 5 years or younger, but some data were collected from the European paediatric phase III comparative study FG-506-06-19.

## Blood concentrations determined in Clinical Studies

Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations were measured at scheduled visits in 12 clinical efficacy and dose-finding studies in which patients with AD received twice-daily application of 0.03%, 0.1% or 0.3% tacrolimus  ointment.    The  duration  of  treatment  was  3  weeks  to  1  year.    The  distribution  of patients  by  maximum  tacrolimus  blood  concentrations  show  that  12.5%  of  paediatric  patients  and 27.0% of adult patients treated with 0.1% tacrolimus had tacrolimus concentrations &gt; 1 ng/ml. There was no evidence of systemic accumulation of tacrolimus in patients (adults and children) treated for prolonged periods (up to one year) with tacrolimus ointment.

In Phase III studies, 13.5% of patients (150/1109) with available data had concentrations ≥ 1 ng/mL and a subsequent  measure  showed  a  decrease  of  20%  in  most  patients  indicating  that  systemic  exposure  is transient.

## Discussion

Tacrolimus is absorbed following topical application. There is short-term accumulation of tacrolimus in the upper layers of skin prior to passive diffusion into the systemic circulation. In adult and paediatric pharmacokinetic studies systemic exposure was low but increased with increasing treatment areas. Most atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03 - 0.3%) had blood concentrations &lt; 1.0 ng/ml. When observed, blood concentrations exceeding  1.0 ng/ml  were  transient.  The  absorption/penetration  of  topically  applied  tacrolimus decreases concurrently with lesion healing. There was no evidence of systemic accumulation following intermittent topical administration for periods of up to one year.

Tacrolimus  blood  concentrations  normalised  to  the  tacrolimus  dose  (0.03%  or  0.1%  ointment),  were similar for 2 to 5 year olds compared with six to 15 year olds, indicating similar pharmacokinetics in both groups.  In  both  adults  and  children  with  an  average  of  50%  body  surface  area  treated,  systemic exposure (i.e. AUC) of tacrolimus from tacrolimus ointment is approximately 30-fold less than that seen with oral immunosuppressive doses in kidney and liver transplant patients. The lowest tacrolimus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood concentration at which systemic effects can be observed is not known. However, 5 ng/ml can be considered an immuno-suppressive concentration as this concentration is used clinically in the latter phases of immuno-suppressive therapy in transplant patients. Approximately 19 % of atopic dermatitis patients in clinical studies experienced tacrolimus blood concentrations of &gt; 1 ng/mL and 1.3% of patients had a maximum concentration of ≥ 5 ng/mL. According to pharmacokinetic models, a Cmin in the 1 to 5 ng/mL range following topical application results in a systemic exposure corresponding to a Cmin of 0.5 to 2.5 ng/mL in transplant patients treated with oral tacrolimus. The applicant argued that this is unlikely to cause systemic immunosuppression as it is below the concentration range required for prevention of allograft  rejection  (5-15  ng/mL).  Clinical  safety  data  on  tacrolimus  ointment  should  be  taken  into consideration for assessing potential immunosuppressive effects.

Tacrolimus is extensively metabolised in the liver and although the concentrations are low following topical  therapy,  the  product  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency  (see section 4.4. of the SPC). Pharmacokinetics in special populations and gender effect were not studied.

- Interaction studies:

No formal interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment were performed. This was justified by the fact that an in vitro study showed that tacrolimus is not metabolised in human skin and systemic exposure with  tacrolimus  ointment  will  be  minimal.  Nevertheless,  interaction  with  topical  antimicrobial products for example cannot be excluded.  Therefore the SPC should indicate that clinical infections at treatment  sites  should  be  cleared  prior  to  commencing  treatment  with  tacrolimus  ointment  and  this should considered in post-marketing. Furthermore, there is a possible interaction with medications that are also metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g. CYP3A4). The concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors to patients with extensive disease including erythrodermic patients may result in significant interactions. This point should be addressed in the SPC with relevant examples CYP3A4 inhibitors provided.

## Clinical efficacy

The tacrolimus ointment development programme included four phase II studies carried out to assess the  optimal  dose/concentration  of  tacrolimus  (two  in  children  and  two  in  adults),  six  phase  III comparative studies (three in adult patients and three in children). Data from the Japanese studies were also provided. All studies were conducted according to GCP.

All  patients  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  studies  were  diagnosed  according  to  Hanifin  and  Rajka  criteria  of moderate to severe AD.

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

## Dose response studies

Four phase II studies were carried out to assess the optimal dose/concentration of tacrolimus, two with children  and  two  with  adults.  Study  FG-506-06-01  was  conducted  in  Europe;  the  others  were conducted  in  the  United  States.  A  total  of  452  patients  participated  in  these  studies;  340  of  whom received tacrolimus ointment. Criteria for success differed slightly between studies.

In  the  European  study  FG-506-06-01,  patients  applied  vehicle  (the  ointment  base,  N=54)  or  0.03% (N=54), 0.1% (N=54), or 0.3% (N=51) tacrolimus ointment twice daily to a selected area for 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in treated area score 1 (the sum of ratings for erythema, edema, and pruritus, maximum=9). Treated area score 2 (maximum=21) combined score 1 with the sum of gradings (0-3) for oozing/crust, excoriation and lichenification, and dryness of noneczematous skin. A global assessment of response of the treated area was also performed (completely resolved, marked improvement, moderate improvement, slight improvement, no change, worse).

ITT: all patients who were randomised, received at least one dose of treatment, and had at least one assessment for efficacy or safety after Day 1

Three times more patients discontinued treatment in the vehicle control group (21 patients, mostly due to  prohibited  therapy)  than  in  the  active  treatment  groups  (7  in  each  treatment  group).  Treated  area score  1  and  score  2  showed  greater  improvement  with  0.03%,  0.1%  and  0.3%  tacrolimus  ointment compared with the vehicle control ( P&lt; 0.001, Jonckheere test). Differences between active treatment groups were not statistically significant. The improvement was also greater for patients who received 0.03%, 0.1%, 0.3% tacrolimus compared with vehicle ( P &lt;0.001, Kruskal-Wallis).

The  U.S.  study  95-0-003  was  conducted  in  paediatric  AD  patients.  Patients  applied  vehicle  (the ointment  base,  N=44)  or  0.03%  (N=43),  0.1%  (N=49),  or  0.3%  (N=44)  tacrolimus  ointment  twice daily for up to 3 weeks. Treatment areas were defined by the investigator at study entry and restricted to  a  maximum  of 30% of the total body surface area. The primary endpoint  was treatment success ( ≥ 75%  improvement  in  the  Physician's  Global  Evaluation  of  Clinical  Response)  at  the  end  of treatment. The findings for this  endpoint and secondary endpoints are summarised in the following table.

Efficacy evaluable population: all patients with &gt;5 applications during 3 consecutive days

1 Difference between vehicle control and each tacrolimus concentration was significant ( P&lt; 0.05) with no significant difference observed with pair-wise comparisons between the 3 tacrolimus ointment concentrations

2 Difference among treatment groups was significant (p&lt;0.001)

3 EASI: Eczema Area and Severity Index (this early version of EASI does not correspond to the EASI used in the Phase III studies described below.

In  summary,  statistically  significantly  greater  improvements  with  tacrolimus  ointment  as  compared  to vehicle  were  shown  in  the  dose  response  studies.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences between the doses (although there was a suggestion of greater efficacy in 0.1% relative to 0.03% in the adult study) and it appears to be a dose-related incidence of application site adverse reactions. Thus the choice of 0.03% and 0.1% doses for further assessment was appropriate. A study investigating once

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

versus  twice-daily  applications  would  have  been  appropriate,  given  the  long  systemic  half-life following repeated administration. Such study was performed in children.

## Main studies (phase III)

The programme included five twice daily Phase III comparative studies, three in adult patients and two  in  children.  All  had  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group  design.  A  total  of 2113 patients were included, 1414 of whom received 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment. The two European trials (one in adults and one in children), which were designed to detect differences between treatment groups, used a reference therapy and so were limited to a three-week treatment duration. The three  US  trials    (two  in  adults  and  one  in  children)  were  vehicle  controlled  with  a  twelve-week treatment duration.

In  addition,  a  study  was  carried  out  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  once  daily  and  twice  daily  0.03% tacrolimus in children (study FG-506-06-24).

The  choice  of  hydrocortisone  acetate  1%  (mild  topical  corticosteroid)  as  comparator  in  the  European paediatric  trials  was  not  considered  optimal  because  of  its  known  limited  efficacy.  Nevertheless, considering existing differences in prescribing practices within countries and the difficulty in proposing a corticosteroid that would be accepted in all cases, this choice was considered acceptable.

Exclusion  criteria included  clinically  infected  AD,  infection  requiring  treatment,  and  clinically significant impairment of renal or hepatic function.

## Demography

Patients had, on average, about one third of their bodies affected by AD lesions and about half had severe disease. There were no major differences in baseline characteristics across treatment groups.

## Efficacy Endpoints

Efficacy  parameters  were  the  modified  Eczema  Area  and  Severity  Index  (mEASI),  the  physician's global evaluation of clinical response and physician's assessment of affected BSA.

The mEASI is a variant of the EASI, which has been validated, and which differs only in having an assessment of itch added. The mEASI itself has not been validated. It therefore includes individual ratings for erythema, oedema/induration/papulation, excoriations and lichenification as well as a score for  the  percentage  of  body  surface  affected.  The  mEASI  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  in  percent  of baseline values was the primary endpoint in the European studies.

Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response: Change from baseline was rated worse, less than 0%; no appreciable improvement 0 to 29%; slight improvements 30 to 49 %; moderate improvement 50 to 74%; marked improvement 75 to 89%; excellent improvement 90-99% and cleared to indicate 100%  improvement.  Treatment  success  was  defined  as  cleared  or  excellent  improvement  and treatment  success  was  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  US  studies  but  a  secondary  endpoint  in  the European studies.

Physician's  Assessment  of  Affected  Body  Surface  Area:  Investigators  estimated  the  percentage  of BSA affected by AD (0-100%) for each of the four body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs). Changes in affected BSA as a percent of total BSA was a secondary endpoint.

## European Trials (3-week duration)

The mEASI mean area under the curve (AUC) as a percent of baseline was the primary endpoint in studies FG-506-06-18 and FG-506-06-19. This measurement considers the average mEASI from Day 1 to the end of treatment expressed as a percent of its baseline value.

Descriptive statistics for this endpoint are summarised in the following tables.  Overall, the data show a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of tacrolimus in both adults and children.

Ι 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment

§ Greater improvement with 0.1% tacrolimus and 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate than with 0.03% tacrolimus

In both the European adult and paediatric studies, the decrease in mEASI from baseline was evident by Day 4 of treatment for all treatment groups, with continued decreases over time in the tacrolimus ointment groups and hydrocortisone butyrate group

Finally, study (FG-506-06-24) in paediatric patients compared treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus once daily versus twice daily versus 1% hydrocortisone acetate twice daily for three weeks.  The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to the end of treatment in the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (mEASI). The main efficacy findings are summarised in the table below.

*This population included one 1-year-old, who was excluded from the age-stratified analysis

In the overall population there was a difference in medians of 9 between once and twice daily 0.03% tacrolimus  ointment.  Statistically  significantly  better  improvement  was  observed  for  twice-daily versus  once-daily  tacrolimus  (p=0.007)  and  for  either  once  daily  or  twice-daily  tacrolimus  versus twice-daily hydrocortisone acetate (p&lt;0.001).

## US-Trials (12 weeks duration)

\"Treatment success\" at the end of treatment (Week 12) was the primary endpoint and was defined as &gt;90%  improvement  ('cleared'  or  'excellent')  in  the  physician's  global  evaluation  of  clinical response.

*Efficacy evaluable population: all randomised patients with study drug for &gt;3 consecutive days from baseline (&gt;5 applications) and &gt; 1 on-treatment value for the physician's global assessment.

Approximately three- to four-fold more patients in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the vehicle group experienced treatment success (vehicle: 7-8%; 0.03%: ∼ 35%; 0.1%: ∼ 40%).  The improvement in  the  tacrolimus-treatment  groups  compared  with  the  vehicle-control  groups  was  statistically significant  for  both  adults  and  children.  The  greater  improvement  with  0.1%  tacrolimus  compared with 0.03% tacrolimus was significant only for the adult study 97-0-036.

Modified intent-to-treat population: all randomised patients who received at least one application of study drug.

The mEASI mean AUC as a percent of baseline was about 25% higher in the vehicle control group than in the tacrolimus treatment groups ( P &lt;0.001, general linear models procedure).

The  decrease  in  mEASI  from  baseline  was  evident  by  Week 1  of  treatment  in  the  two  tacrolimus treatment groups with further decreases until the end of treatment.

## Quality of life

All  five  phase  III  comparative  studies  showed  improvements  in  quality  of  life  as  determined  using validated  questionnaires  (Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  in  adult  patients  and  the  Children's Dermatological Life Quality Index in paediatric patients).  In general, treatment differences paralleled the results for the efficacy endpoints.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No studies in special populations other than children (from 2 to 15 years of age) were performed.

## Exploratory analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis).

To assess whether there were any prognostic factors that influenced the efficacy of 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, the primary endpoint of each study was analysed by baseline disease severity, percent affected body surface area at baseline, and pre-baseline eczema  treatments.  Efficacy  conclusions  for  all  subgroups  were  the  same  as  those  for  the  overall population.  There  was  no  subgroup  that  showed  a  markedly  different  treatment  response  than  the overall population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with high baseline lichenification scores (lichenified skin on at least three body regions) did not respond as well to treatment with tacrolimus as patients with low baseline scores.  However, the response to tacrolimus was better than the response to vehicle. Treatment of lichenified lesions with tacrolimus seems appropriate.

To assess any influence of race on efficacy, stratified analyses by race of the primary endpoint of the European and U.S. phase III studies were carried out. The results suggest similar efficacy for different racial subgroups although it was noted that there was a greater treatment difference between the two doses in the black adult population.

## Supportive studies

## Long-term Studies

Two open-label, multicentre, long-term studies were conducted using only tacrolimus 0.1% ointment. (European  study  FG-506-06-12;  &gt;18  years,  n=316;  U.S.  paediatric  study  96-0-025;  2-15  years, n=255). Twelve-month data are available for 68 and 180 patients, respectively.

The  efficacy  results  (mEASI  and  affected  body  surface  area)  confirm  the  results  of  the  short  term studies. Mean daily ointment use in adults during Months 3, 6, and 12 was about 60% of the mean daily usage during Week 1.  This decrease in ointment use may have corresponded to decreases in the size  of  the  treated  area  with  the  largest  decreases  occurring  in  the  first  week.  Further  clinical improvement was seen up to Month 3 and was maintained during the rest of the study. The long-term studies, however, were primarily done to assess safety.

Recurrence was  assessed in the paediatric study.  The average time to recurrence for these patients after the first AD episode was 55 days.  Recurrence in the adult study was not monitored.

## Japanese studies

In two Phase III comparative studies including a total of 329 patients 0.1% tacrolimus was found to have a similar efficacy to a potent topical corticosteroid (0.12% betamethasone valerate ointment) and a superior efficacy to a medium  to  low  potency  topical  corticosteroid  (0.1%  alclometasone dipropionate ointment).

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The results  of  the  pivotal  efficacy  studies  indicate  that  tacrolimus  is  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of acute  flares  of  moderate  to  severe  AD  and  that  the  benefit  is  seen  within  a  few  days  following commencement  of  treatment  (according  to  secondary  analysis).  Nevertheless,  pharmacokinetic, clinical and safety data as well as assessment of relapse/recurrence were taken into consideration to define the recommended posology.

## Dose response

In  the  pivotal  twice-daily  studies,  patients  were  not  assigned  to  treatments  according  to  severity  of disease  but  were  randomised  to  one  of  three  treatment  groups  (vehicle/comparator,  0.03%  or  0.1% ointment). Current management of AD involves the use of potent steroids for the treatment of acute flares and subsequent tapering with resolution of the condition.  While the design of the pivotal studies does  not  reflect  this  clinical  practice,  it  provides  a  useful  opportunity  to  compare  the  efficacy  and safety  of  the  two  strengths  proposed  for  marketing.  In  the  adult  population,  12%  more  patients experienced  treatment  success  with  the  higher  dose  and  about  a  10%  greater  improvement  in  the mEASI  was  seen  with  the  higher  concentration.  It  also  seems  that  patients  healed  faster  with  the higher concentration. However, skin burning and alcohol intolerance also reached a higher incidence with the higher concentration. In addition, the systemic exposure increased with increasing concentration. In children the difference in response between the higher and the lower dose was less marked. These were taken into account in the recommended posology for each dose.

Half  of  the  adults  in  the  phase  III  comparative  studies  applied  at  least  3.9  to  5.6  g  of  tacrolimus ointment per day, and one quarter applied at least 7.4 to 10 g daily. Based on a pooled analysis of all seven phase III studies more than half of the patients treated more that 30% of their total body surface area.  Approximately  one  third  treated  at  least  50%  of  their  body  surface  area.  Increases  in  body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

surface area treated were not associated with a change in benefit to risk balance and restrictions in ointment use do not seem necessary.

## Twice-daily versus once-daily application

The twice daily dosing was questioned as kinetic data demonstrating a long half-life (initial half-life of 9 hours increasing to 70-80 hours following 14 days treatment) suggested that a longer dosing interval could be appropriate. Taking into account that efficacy has mainly been demonstrated with twice daily and that following repeated treatment there is a decrease in the rate (slower absorption than elimination) and  extent  of  topical  absorption  of  tacrolimus  due  to  healing  of  skin  lesions,  a  decrease  in  dosing frequency from twice daily to once daily may be possible after a clinical improvement in skin lesions, which should provide a better safety profile.

## Intermittent short-term use versus continuous for a relapsing condition

In practice, patients with atopic dermatitis will most likely treat their disease when it is active and will modify  the  regimen  as  the  condition  heals  either  deliberately  or  because  of  poor  compliance. Intermittent use is more appropriate than continuous use given the relapsing course of this condition. Since atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease treatment may be over long term. The studies performed support  the  use  of  tacrolimus  as  treatment  of  flares  of  moderate  to  severe  atopic  dermatitis    'as required', either short term or intermittent long term. This is reflected in the proposed posology.

## Relapse/recurrence/rebound

The  study  designs  included  abrupt  discontinuation  of  treatment  and  in  some  cases  monitoring  of recurrence.  As  the  duration  of  treatment  in  the  European  and  US  pivotal  studies  were  different  (3 versus  12  weeks),  the  duration  of  treatment's  impact  on  recurrence  rate  was  questioned.  As  the disposition half-life increased to 80 hours after 14 days treatment, it was also questioned if this could impact on the incidence of relapse or recurrence. It was finally considered important to know whether tapering of dose could reduce relapse, recurrence or rebound.

Tapering  of  doses  was  not  assessed  in  clinical  studies.  The  design  of  the  studies  did  not  allow  an appropriate retrospective analysis of relapse/recurrence/rebound rates, however, findings at follow-up for these studies did not suggest a large difference between the recurrence rate of patients treated for three or  twelve  weeks,  nor  suggested  differences  in  rebound.  It  appears  that  recurrence  occurred  in approximately half of the patients two weeks after the end of treatment  (US studies) and in the European studies half of the patients maintained moderate improvement at 2 week follow up.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Presentation of adverse events is made both by individual study and a pooled analysis of the five main pivotal  trials.  Because  of  the  difference  in  duration  of  the  European  and  US  studies,  the  pooled analysis  of  incidence  was  limited  to  the  first  three  weeks.  To  supplement  the  pooled  analysis  of incidence at week 3, Kaplan-Meier rates of adverse events at week 3 and week 12 were calculated for the 5 pivotal studies.

## Adverse events and serious adverse events

## Pivotal Studies

In the individual studies, the incidence of adverse events at the end of treatment was calculated for each treatment group, with treatment-differences assessed with Fisher's exact test. In the U.S. studies, statistical analysis of Kaplan-Meier rates of selected adverse events (using the generalised Wilcoxon test  to  assess  treatment  differences) was carried  out  because of the differences in time-on-treatment among the  treatment  groups  (the  U.S.  studies  had  a  very  high  drop-out  rate  in  the  vehicle  control group, which led to a shorter duration of treatment for vehicle-treated patients).

## European studies

The table below shows the incidence of most common adverse events, irrespective of causality. In both adult and paediatric studies, skin burning and pruritus were the most common adverse events and were  the  only  adverse  events  that  were  statistically  significantly  more  common  in  the  two  tacrolimus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment groups. It was noted that over 90% of these adverse events were localised to the application site. It  is  also  noted  that  these  adverse  events  decreased  in  prevalence  with  time.  Although  skin  burning occurred in up to 56.5% of patients in the adult studies in days 1-4, and it had reduced to 20.7% by days 5-8,  a  figure  of  up  to  14.7%  was  still  noted  at  week  2,  and  in  the  children,  up  to  19.9%  day  1-4  had reduced to 4.9% at days 5-8.

Incidence  of infection  adverse  events was  analysed  separately  and  folliculitis  was  the  most  common infection  in  adults  (7-8%)  and flu  syndrome  in children  (around  8%).  The  incidence  of  infections  was similar across treatment groups.

## US Studies

The table below shows the incidence of most common adverse events, irrespective of causality.

Skin irritation adverse events (skin burning, pruritus and skin erythema) were the most common adverse events in both the adult and paediatric studies and occurred more commonly in the tacrolimus groups than in the vehicle control groups. Over 90 % were localised to the application site. Hyperaesthesia occurred more commonly in the adult treatment groups.

Alcohol intolerance occurred in both adult tacrolimus treatment groups.

Flu  syndrome  and  headache occurred  more  commonly  in  the  adult  tacrolimus  groups  although  it  is suggested that the higher incidence may be related to the lower incidence in the vehicle groups due to premature withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. In one of the three studies there is a suggestion that the incidence may be dose related.

It is noted that there was a higher incidence of flu syndrome, headache and otitis media in the paediatric tacrolimus treatment groups.

Adverse events showing a treatment effect that was consistent in both the analysis of incidence and the analysis of time-adjusted rates in at least one study were skin irritation adverse events (skin burning, pruritus and hyperesthesia/increased skin sensitivity), alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or facial skin irritation  after  consumption  of  alcohol),  headache,  allergic  reaction  ( e.g. ,  allergic  conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and allergic reaction to food), folliculitis and acne.

* Due to a high drop-out rate in the vehicle groups, the average treatment period was approximately three-fold longer in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the vehicle control groups.

† Common: experienced by at least 5% of patients in any treatment group in either study

## Pooled Data from 5 Pivotal Studies (at 3 weeks)

The incidence of application site adverse events was higher in the tacrolimus or vehicle groups than in the  corticosteroid  groups  and  the  tacrolimus  group  had  an  approximately  10%  higher  incidence  of application  site  adverse  events  than  the  vehicle  group.  In  all  treatment  groups  these  adverse  events were considered to be causally related.

The incidence of non application site adverse events was similar across all treatment groups. Overall there were fewer adverse events noted in children.

Adverse events were analysed by age, gender, baseline severity, and by percent of BSA affected at baseline  and  none  of  the  analyses  showed  a  subpopulation  at  a  greater  risk  of  any  given  adverse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

events.  It  was  however  noted  that  fever  and  cough  occurred  more  often  in  children,  and  headache more  often  in  adults;  female  patients  tended  to  experience  more  skin  burning,  flu  syndrome  and headache and not surprisingly patients  with severe disease and larger  areas  involved  reported  more skin burning, pruritus and skin erythema.

All  application  adverse  events  associated  with  tacrolimus  were  skin  adverse  events  (skin  burning, pruritus,  skin  erythema,  hyperaesthesia).  Approximately  half  of  all  patients  treated  with  tacrolimus experienced  skin  irritation  and  the  incidence  was  about  20%  higher  in  adults.  In  both  adults  and children there was a higher incidence of skin irritation adverse events with the higher concentration of tacrolimus although this was significant only for skin burning in adults. The prevalence decreased over time. Common complications of AD such as skin infection, dry skin, pustular rash and face oedema appear to have been reduced in patients administered tacrolimus.

Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing/facial irritation after consumption of alcohol) occurred in 0.5% of the 0.03% tacrolimus group and 1.3% of the 0.1% tacrolimus group and in none of the patients who received vehicle or hydrocortisone butyrate.

In both adults and children, folliculitis had a greater incidence in tacrolimus or reference groups than in the vehicle groups. The incidence of skin infection was lower in patients treated with tacrolimus and reference compared with vehicle in both adults and children. The incidence of pustular rash in children was also reduced.

Herpes  simplex  occurred  numerically  (though  not  statistically  significantly)  more  often  in  the tacrolimus  groups and the rate  was  consistent  with  the  prevalence  observed  in  a  patient  population with AD.

## Long-term Studies

The  long-term  (1-year)  safety  profile  observed  in  the  adult  and  paediatric  long-term  studies  was similar  to  that  observed  in  the  short-term  studies,  with  application-site  irritation  being  a  common adverse event at treatment onset.

In  the  adult  study  (FG-506-06-12),  5.1%  of  the  patients  experienced  one  or  more  serious  adverse events. A causal relationship could not be excluded for herpes simplex (eczema herpeticum), herpes zoster (varicella), skin infection (staphylococcus superinfection), exacerbation of AD and cellulitis.  In the paediatric study (96-0-025) 8.2% of the patients experienced one or more serious adverse events with skin infection, eczema herpeticum, and asthma as events for which a causal relationship could not be excluded.

In general, the long-term studies did not raise additional safety concerns.

## Japanese Studies

In two Phase III comparative studies including a total of 329 patients, sensations of skin irritation at the  application  site  (flush,  tingling,  itching)  were  reported  in  significantly  more  tacrolimus-treated patients than betamethasone-treated patients ( p &lt;0.001).

In  a  long-term  safety  study,  in  which  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  AD  (n=568)  applied  0.1% tacrolimus once or twice daily for 52 weeks showed similar overall findings to the European and U.S. long-term studies.  The incidence of eczema herpeticum (5.6% of patients), however, was higher than observed  in  the  U.S.  and  European  studies.    Overall,  analysis  of  safety  during  a  second  year  of treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was consistent with that from the first year of treatment.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

These  adverse  events  occurred  in  54/1414  (3.8%)  and  with  a  similar  frequency  in  the  vehicle  and reference groups (42/699,6.0%).

In  adults  studies,  skin  burning  and  pruritus  were  the  most  common  adverse  events  leading  to discontinuation in the active treatment groups. The other reasons for discontinuation were: pruritus, skin infection, herpes simplex. In the US studies, more patients in the vehicle group had an adverse event leading to discontinuation than in the tacrolimus groups.

Discontinuations in the paediatric studies were due to skin infection, pruritus, skin burning/erythema, urticaria, pain (0.03%), asthma, 5 cases of chicken pox and one allergic reaction to food  (0.1%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious Adverse Events

Serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in 15/1414 (1.1%) and had a similar frequency in both vehicle and reference treatment groups (8/699,1.1%). SAEs in the tacrolimus groups were often related to the complications of atopic dermatitis such as skin infection, concomitant atopic infection disease such as asthma or allergic reactions, concomitant diseases present at baseline or common childhood or adult conditions.

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory assessments included haematology, electrolytes, enzymes, glucose, creatinine and bilirubin.  In  all  five  pivotal  studies,  no  consistent  changes  or  notable  differences  among  treatment groups in laboratory profile were observed.

## Safety in special populations

Tacrolimus ointment has not been evaluated for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis.  Before commencing treatment with tacrolimus ointment, clinical infections at treatment sites should be cleared.

Tacrolimus ointment has not been evaluated in children below the age of 2 years.

A separate analysis was performed for elderly patients (&gt;65 years) and showed a similar safety profile.

## Discussion on clinical safety

According  to  pre-clinical  data,  a  risk  of  photo-toxicity  cannot  be  excluded.  The  potential  for photocarcinogenicity  is  of  concern,  in  particular  as  AD  patients  may  be  treated  with  UVB  or  PUVA. Phototoxicity has not been observed in a large clinical database. Therefore, patients have to be advised to minimise exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light, including sunlight and light from a solarium, and therapy with PUVA or UVB should be avoided.

Safety  data  demonstrate  a  pronounced  irritating  effect  (application  site  adverse  events  considered causally related) of vehicle and at a higher level tacrolimus ointment. Although the vehicle is certainly not well tolerated, it is supposed to be the best pharmaceutical compromise. Such irritation effects tend to be self-limiting in clinical use.

The risk and aetiology of alcohol intolerance were considered. Vasodilatation was seldom in the five phase III comparative studies; 0.3% of patients who received vehicle and 0.3% and 0.6% of patients who received 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, respectively, reported this event. For almost all patients  who reported  this  event,  alcohol  intolerance  occurred  at  the  application-site,  which  reflects local rather than systemic action. There was no association between alcohol intolerance and tacrolimus blood  concentrations.  Alcohol  intolerance  could  be  to  the  consequence  of  combined  vasodilatative effects of alcohol and local irritating effects of tacrolimus ointment.

The main issue regarding safety of this product is the potential effect on Immunocompetence.

Pharmacokinetic  data  suggest  the  possibility  of  systemic  exposure  to  tacrolimus  with  resulting potential immunosuppressant effect. The lowest tacrolimus blood level at which systemic effects can be observed is not known. In a retrospective analysis, which included adverse event data and tacrolimus blood  concentrations  from  five  phase  III  comparative  studies,  no  conclusive  relationship  between systemic exposure and adverse events was discernible.

The  techniques  used  to  assess  immunocompetence  (Recall  Antigen  Test)  are  insensitive,  and  only detect immunosuppression in a minority of patients on systemic immunosuppression. Incomplete data presentation further compromises interpretation.  The only available data are in adults, and cannot be extrapolated to children where immune system is under development.  Therefore, tacrolimus ointment may  potentially  have  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  cell-mediated  immunity.  Testing  to  evaluate immunocompetence  should  have  utilised  methods  considered  satisfactory  for  the  investigation  of primary  immunodeficiency  by  the  International  Union  of  Immunological  Societies  (IUIS).    In  the absence of specific data, the assessment  of the reports of infections is of major importance.

In  each  of  the  5  pivotal  studies  the  incidence  of  herpes  simplex  infection  was  higher  in  the  0.1% tacrolimus group as compared to the vehicle/reference therapy groups.  In a pooled analysis of the data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  the  five  main  phase  III  studies  studies  (12-week  studies  truncated  at  week  3),  the  differences observed were not statistically significant but an appreciable numerical difference between the control and tacrolimus groups was shown (see following table). Controlled long-term studies, which may help clarifying the issue, are not available. Therefore, the possibility that tacrolimus treatment leads to an increased incidence of herpes simplex infections cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, 'herpes simplex' was added to Section 4.8 of the SPC.

Regarding  flu  syndrome,  data  in  the  original  documentation  showed  a  dose-dependent  substantial increase of flu syndrome in the 12-week US studies (but not in the 3-week studies). The analysis (see table above) by pooling the data of the five phase III comparative studies (12 week studies truncated at week 3) did not detect significant differences however, a Kaplan-Meier analysis at weeks 3 and 12 for Flu syndrome in US Phase III studies showed non statistical numerical differences, which does not rule out the possibility of an increased risk for flu syndrome. The data from non comparative longterm studies are not suitable for clarifying this issue. It is recognized, however, that the results from a total of 4116 patients in the follow-up study (99-0-054) do not establish that there is an increasing risk of flu syndrome (or herpes simplex) over time.

In addition, from the review of the Phase III clinical studies, folliculitis was identified as a treatmentrelated adverse event.

There were 33 cases of lymphadenopathy (0.08%) reported in clinical trials.  The majority of these cases  related  to  infections  (skin,  respiratory  tract,  tooth)  and  resolved  with  appropriate  antibiotic therapy.  However, as lymphadenopathy could be a marker of systemic immunosuppression, the SPC will specify that patients treated with tacrolimus ointment who develop lymphadenopathy should be monitored and investigated.

While monitoring of infection appears reassuring, if only a small percentage of patients experience significant systemic exposure, then larger studies are required to identify increased rates of infections in this subgroup of patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect of treatment with tacrolimus ointment on the immune system of children has not yet been established. The effect of tacrolimus ointment on the development of regulatory T cells has not been adequately investigated.  Because of the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit the development of regulatory T  cells,  it  is  of  concern  that  children,  in  particular,  treated  with  tacrolimus  may  be  more  likely  to become treatment dependent and less likely to 'grow out' of their disease.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant with which there are many years clinical experience in the  prevention  and  treatment  of  organ  transplant  rejection.  Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic studies provided some pharmacological activity of tacrolimus in a topical formulation for the treatment of atopic dermatitis but the exact mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. From the pharmacokinetic point of view, topical administration studies suggested that absorption of tacrolimus is low and highly variable. Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that the proposed formulation is locally irritating and may have a potential for photocarcinogencity.

## Efficacy

The results of the pivotal efficacy studies indicate that tacrolimus is effective in the treatment of acute flares  of  moderate  to  severe  AD.  In  the  adult  population,  the  higher  concentration  showed  a  better efficacy. It also seems that patients healed with the higher concentration heal faster. In children the difference in  response  between the  higher and the lower dose was less  marked. The higher strength ointment is only proposed for use in the adults. Twice-daily application is more efficacious than oncedaily  application  in  the  first  two  weeks.  Following  repeated  treatment,  there  is  a  decrease  in  the  rate (slower absorption than elimination) and extent of topical absorption of tacrolimus due to healing of skin lesions.  Therefore,  decrease  in  dosing  frequency  from  twice  daily  to  once  daily  may  be  possible  after improvement in skin lesions, and should provide a better safety profile.

## Safety

The most common adverse events were skin irritation adverse events (skin burning, pruritus and skin erythema). According to pre-clinical data, a risk of photo-toxicity cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, phototoxicity has not been observed in a large clinical database. The potential for photocarcinogenicity is of concern, in particular as AD patients may be treated with UVB or PUVA. Therefore, patients have to be advised to minimise exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light, including sunlight and light from a solarium, and therapy with PUVA or UVB should be avoided. The main safety issue is the potential effect  on  immunocompetence.  Pharmacokinetic  data  show  some  degree  of  systemic  exposure  to tacrolimus with resultant potential immunosuppressant effect. The techniques used in this application to assess immunocompetence were insensitive and limited to adults. The incidences of herpes simplex infection and flu syndrome seemed higher, though not statistically significantly so, in the tacrolimus group  than  in  the  vehicle/reference  therapy  groups.  Folliculitis  was  also  identified  as  a  treatmentrelated adverse event and lymphadenopathy may be a marker of systemic immunosuppression.

The effect of tacrolimus ointment on the development of regulatory T cells has not been adequately investigated. The effect of treatment with tacrolimus ointment on the developing immune system of children, especially the young, has not yet been established.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The results  of  the  pivotal  efficacy  studies  indicate  that  tacrolimus  is  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of acute  flares  of  moderate  to  severe  AD.  However,  a  concern  remains  regarding  tacrolimus  ointment potential for immunosuppression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  view  of  the  systemic  absorption  of  tacrolimus,  albeit  minimal,  and  the  potential  for  systemic immunosuppression, it is recommended that tacrolimus ointment should be reserved for the treatment of adult patients who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies (such as moderately potent topical steroids).

The effect of tacrolimus ointment on the development of regulatory T cells and on the immune system of  children  has  not  been  established.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  tacrolimus  0.03%,  only,  be reserved for the treatment of children (2 years of age and above) who failed to respond adequately to conventional therapies.

The treatment will also be restricted to dermatologists and physicians with extensive experience in the treatment  of  atopic  dermatitis  with  immunomodulating  therapy,  because  tacrolimus  represents  a  new option (an immunomodulator) for a chronic disease to be used intermittently over long periods with the potential for immunosuppression.

As a consequence, tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for the treatment of adults and 0.03% for the treatment of adults and children can be approved for the following indications:

Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment

'Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies.

Treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  atopic  dermatitis  in  children  who  failed  to  respond  adequately  to conventional therapies.'

Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment

'Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies.'

Further  studies  to  assess  the  impact  of  tacrolimus  ointment  on  cell-mediated  immunity  should  be performed and an intensive monitoring of infectious adverse events and malignancies (systemic and cutaneous) will be set up post-authorisation. Finally, further information on use in children (infants) below the age of 2 years is expected, as adverse atopic dermatitis is frequent in infants. The applicant has committed to a program of FollowUp Measures in order to resolve these issues within an agreed timeframe.

## Recommendation

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Protopic (0.03% and 0.1%) in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies was favourable as well as the benefit/risk profile of Protopic 0.03% in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children (2 years of age and above) who failed to respond adequately to conventional therapies, and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
