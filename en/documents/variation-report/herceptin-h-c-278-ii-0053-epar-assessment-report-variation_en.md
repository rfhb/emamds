## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-derived humanised monoclonal antibody  that  selectively  targets  the  extracellular  domain  of  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor receptor 2 protein (HER-2). Trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with breast cancer (early and metastatic) and in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Herceptin can only be used when the  cancer  has  shown  to  'overexpress'  HER2:  this  means  that  the  cancer  produces  a  protein  called HER2 in large quantities on the surface of the tumour cells. Herceptin was authorised in the EU on 28 th August 2000. The presentation granted in Europe was the 150 mg trastuzumab vial.

The currently approved indication for Herceptin is shown below:

## Breast Cancer

Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)

Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer:

- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.
-  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable.
-  in  combination  with  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
-  in  combination  with  an  aromatase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  patients  with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab.

Early Breast Cancer (EBC)

Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## Metastatic Gastric Cancer (MGC)

Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of  patients  with  HER2  positive  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  stomach  or  gastro-esophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease.

Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer whose tumours have HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see Sections 4.4 and 5.1).

In the current variation application, the MAH proposed an extension of indication to include concurrent use  of  Herceptin  with  chemotherapy  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  HER2-positive  early breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, or as part of a treatment regimen in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin.

## 3.2. Clinical aspects

## 3.2.1. Introduction

Adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer with Herceptin as single agent for one year was approved in 2006  based  on  the  results  from  the  HERA  trial.  The  MAH  now  intends  to  extend  the  indication  to include concurrent use of Herceptin with chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting based on the results from three studies. These studies NSABP B-31, NCCTG N9831 and BCIRG006 performed independently by different academic study groups are described in Table 1. The MAH has provided the study report of the  joint  analysis  of  studies  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  (these  studies  were  submitted  as supportive data during the assessment of the HERA trial data), an 18-month update addendum to the joint  analysis,  the  study  report  of  study  BCIRG006  and  a  5-year  cardiac  safety  update  report  from BCIRG006.

## 3.3. Clinical efficacy

## 3.3.1. Study BCIRG006

This study was a randomized multicenter Phase III Randomized Trial conducted by the Breast Cancer International  Research  Group  (CIRG),    comparing  Doxorubicin  and  Cyclophosphamide  followed  by Docetaxel  (AC → T)  with  Doxorubicin  and  Cyclophosphamide  and  Trastuzumab  (Herceptin)  (AC → TH) and  with  Docetaxel,  Carboplatin,  and  Trastuzumab  (DCarbH)  in  the  Adjuvant  Treatment  of  NodePositive and High-Risk Node-Negative Patients with Operable Breast Cancer.

High-risk node-negative status was defined as node-negative status with at least one of the following: tumour size &gt; 2 cm, hormonal receptor status negative (estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative), histologic and/or nuclear grade 2 or 3, or age &lt; 35 years.

## 3.3.1.1. Methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

There were three treatment arms:

AC → T Arm: Every 3 weeks for four cycles, patients in the AC → T arm received 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin as a 5- to 15-minute intravenous (IV) bolus injection followed by 600 mg/m2 IV cyclophosphamide as a 5- to 60-minute IV bolus injection. Beginning 3 weeks after the last cycle of AC, patients received 100 mg/m2 docetaxel as a 1-hour IV infusion every 3 weeks for four cycles.

AC → TH  Arm: Every  3  weeks  for  four  cycles,  patients  in  the  AC → TH  arm  received  60  mg/m2 doxorubicin as a 5- to 15-minute IV bolus injection followed by 600 mg/m2 IV cyclophosphamide as a 5- to 60-minute IV bolus injection. Three weeks after the last treatment with AC (i.e., on Day 1 of Cycle 5), a 4-mg/kg Herceptin loading dose was administered as a 90-minute IV infusion. Beginning on Day  8  of  Cycle  5,  2  mg/kg  Herceptin  was  administered  as  a  30-minute  IV  infusion  every  week. Docetaxel  100  mg/m2  was  administered  as  a  1-hour  IV  infusion  every  3  weeks  for  four  cycles, beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 5 and then on Day 1 of all subsequent cycles. Beginning 3 weeks after the last treatment with docetaxel, 6 mg/kg Herceptin was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Herceptin treatment was to continue for 1 year from the date of first administration, regardless of the number of doses received or missed. For days on which docetaxel and Herceptin were both due to be administered, docetaxel was administered first.

DCarbH Arm: The doses of docetaxel and carboplatin in the DCarbH arm are based on those used in this previous study, BCIRG 102.  Herceptin was given intravenously at a dose of 4 mg/kg load followed by  2  mg/kg  weekly  during  chemotherapy.  After  completion  of  chemotherapy,  Herceptin  was administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. This 3 weekly dosing regimen was also used in the adjuvant setting in the HERA study.

The DCarbH regimen was modified so that the platinum salt was limited to carboplatin (i.e., cisplatin was no longer allowed), based on updated results from the BCIRG 101 and 102 studies.  At that time (April 2002) 28 patients were already treated with cisplatinum.

Dose modifications:

In  case  of  severe  toxicity,  chemotherapy  discontinuation,  dose  reductions,  or  dosing  delays  were planned for each of the treatment arms. No dose reductions were planned for Herceptin. For patients who experienced Herceptin-related Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities other than those related to cardiac dysfunction, Herceptin was to be held until recovery to Grade 1 or 2. If recovery to Grade 1 or 2 did not occur, continuation of Herceptin was left to the discretion of the investigator. If the same Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity recurred, Herceptin was permanently discontinued. Herceptin was not to be held for hematologic toxicity. Dose modification for cardiac toxicity was not allowed.

## Objectives

Primary Objective: To compare  disease-free survival after treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (Taxotere) (AC → T)  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and trastuzumab (Herceptin) (AC → TH) and with docetaxel in combination with carboplatin  and  Herceptin  (DCarbH)  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  node  positive  and  high  risk  node negative patients with operable breast cancer containing the HER2 alteration.

## Secondary Objectives:

- -To compare overall survival between the 3 above mentioned arms.
- To compare cardiac toxicity between the 3 above mentioned arms.
- To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 3 above mentioned arms.
- To evaluate pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy in these patient groups.
- In addition, an independent socio-economic study will be conducted in parallel with the clinical study.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy outcome measure was DFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional or distant relapse, date of second primary cancer and death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Relapse was defined as any clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor recurrence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary efficacy outcome measure was OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or last contact. Other secondary outcome measures were related to quality of life and evaluation of pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy (data not shown).

## Sample size

The initial sample size calculation was based on a 5 year DFS rate of 55% in patients receiving AC → T, a clinically relevant improvement of 5 years DFS to be detected of 7%,  = 0.017 (2-sided) for each of the planned 3 pair wise comparisons and 80% power. Based on these assumptions it was calculated that a total of 1308 DFS events had to be observed, translating to 1050 subjects per treatment arm (i.e. a total of 3150 subjects). It was planned to perform one interim analysis when 654 DFS events would have been observed (applying a Haybittle-Peto error spending function).

When the results of the BCIRG001 study became available the IDCM and the steering committee of the study proposed a modification of the assumptions for sample size consideration (taking into account the BCIRG001 data indicating a presumed 5-year DFS of 70% in the AC → T arm) as well as additional interim analyses when 300, 450, and 650 DFS events had been observed (error spending function of O'Brien and Fleming type was to be used with overall significance levels of 0.0002, 0.0030, and 0.0111, respectively, for the interim analyses). The overall significance level for the main analysis was 0.0461. Furthermore, the testing strategy was modified in order to gain more power. It was calculated that 900 DFS events were to be observed at the final analysis in order to achieve 80% power.

In addition, instead of the initially planned Bonferroni adjustment a 'step-down' testing procedure was used to account for the 3 pair wise intergroup comparisons. Each of the 2 Herceptin arms was to be compared  to  the  AC → T  arm  at  the  /2  level.  If  both  comparisons  were  statistically  significant,  the comparison between the two Herceptin-containing regimens could be conducted at the  level.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomised to one of the three treatment arms. A minimisation algorithm balancing for center, number of axillary lymph nodes involved (0, 1-3, or ≥ 4)  and hormonal receptor status (ER and/or PR positive vs. negative) was used for treatment allocation.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  ITT  population  according  to  the  randomised  treatment assignment. Time to event endpoints were compared by means for a log-rank test, the impact of prespecified  covariates  was  assessed  by  means  of  COX  regression.  For  DFS  and  OS  respectively  the results of log-rank tests stratified for nodal status and hormone receptor status was applied. Observed treatment  effects  were  described  by  means  of  95%  confidence  intervals.  Specific  measures  (see sample  size  section)  were  planned  to  account  for  the  multiplicity  issues  arising  from  the  interim analyses and multiple group comparisons.

To  assess  the  homogeneity  of  treatment  effects,  subgroup  analyses  were  planned  for  important subgroups  (e.g.  nodal  status,  age,  number  of  positive  lymph  nodes).  Furthermore,  additional sensitivity analyses (e.g. applying an alternative definition of DFS endpoint or assessing time to first distant disease recurrence) were planned to assess the robustness of study results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3.1.2 Results

The primary efficacy analysis is based upon data from the second interim analysis, which included 474 DFS  events:  195  in  the  AC → T  arm,  134  in  the  AC → TH  arm,  and  145  in  the  DCarbH  arm  and corresponding to a median duration of follow-up of 36 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The results of this 2 nd interim analysis (data cut-off 01 November 2006) are reported below.

- The efficacy population consists of all randomized patients, and all analyses were conducted according to the ITT principle.
- The safety population consists of all treated patients and all analyses were conducted on an \"as-treated\" basis.
- Patients 30857, 31363, 31579, 32022, 32376, and 33197 were randomized to receive AC-TH but did not receive Herceptin.
- Patient 31682 was randomized to ACT but received her first dose of Herceptin during the monotherapy phase of the study. One patient (30344) was randomized to receive TCH but received ACTH.
- Patients 32533 and 32816 received Herceptin but no chemotherapy.

Per protocol, crossover was not allowed; however, a total of 18 patients from the control arm crossed over and received Herceptin.

## Recruitment

Enrollment started in March 2001 and stopped in March 2004. A total of 3222 patients were entered into the study. At the time of study report, the study was still ongoing.

In  the  all  randomized  patient  population,  median  duration  of  follow-up  was  2.9  years  in  the AC → T (range: 0.0-5.2 years) arm, 3.0 years in both the AC → TH (range: 0.1-5.3 years) and DCarbH (range: 0.0-5.1 years) arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

The study was conducted by oncologist investigators in 43 countries. A total of 433 sites recruited the 3222 enrolled patients. The number of centres by country ranged from one centre (Bosnia, Cyprus, Greece, Sweden, and Switzerland) to 177 centres (United States). The number of patients by country ranged  from  two  to  990.  The  largest  enrolling  countries  were  the  United  States  (=  990;  30.7%), Germany (n = 313; 9.7%), Australia (n = 293; 9.1%) and Poland (n = 260; 8.1%).

Subsequent  to  study  initiation,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  clarify  study  conduct,  amend  the statistical considerations, and report changes to the administrative structure. In total, there were four protocol amendments.

## Baseline data

Baseline  characteristics  for  the  stratification  factors  used  (center,  number  of  positive  lymph  nodes, hormonal receptor status) are shown in Table 3:

aPatient 30839 was found to be HER2-positive based upon local test results but could not be assessed by the central laboratory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Positive  HER2  status  by  FISH  performed  at  the  central  laboratory  was  mandatory  at  the  time  of enrolment. A total of 99.6% of patients (3209 of 3222) were HER2-positive.

All  patients  underwent  primary  surgery  for  breast  cancer  prior  to  study  enrolment  and  treatment randomization.  Infiltrating  ductal  carcinoma  was  the  most  common  histopathologic  type  in  all treatment arms (&gt; 90 % of patients). Most tumours were poorly differentiated and were excised with clear  margins.    The  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  the  type  of  primary  breast cancer surgery and other tumour characteristics.

Furthermore, the mean age of patients was 48.8 years for the AC → T arm (range, 23-74 years), 48.7 years for the AC → TH arm (range, 22-74 years), and 48.6 years for the DCarbH arm (range, 23-73 years). The median weight was 66.0 kg for the AC-&gt;T arm, 68.0 kg for the AC → TH arm, and 66.4 kg for the DCarbH arm. Karnofsky performance status was 100% for 79.8% of patients in the AC → T arm, for 79.4% of patients in the AC → TH arm, and for 80.2% of patients in the DCarbH arm.

No notable differences in non-cardiac medical history were observed across the three treatment arms. Of  note,  ongoing  hypertension  at  baseline  was  observed  for  16.2%  of  patients  in  the  AC → T  arm, 16.7% of patients in the AC → TH arm, and 17.7% of patients in the DCarbH arm. Similarly, 12.9% of patients in the AC → T arm, 14.1% of patients in the AC → TH arm, and 14.8% of patients in the DCarbH arm reported prior use of a cardiovascular medication.

Likewise, no notable differences are observed with regard to hormonal therapies, also broken down by menopausal status.

## Numbers analysed

The primary efficacy analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., all inclusion of all randomized patients, analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment). For a summary of the patient populations see Table 2.

All safety analyses included patients who received any amount of study treatment according to actual treatment  regimen  received.  With  a  few  exceptions,  patients  followed  their  allocated  treatment assignment.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint (DFS)

The primary efficacy analysis is based upon data from the second interim analysis, which included 474 DFS  events:  195  in  the  AC → T  arm,  134  in  the  AC → TH  arm,  and  145  in  the  DCarbH  arm  and corresponding to a median duration of follow-up of 36 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates).

A summary of DFS events is presented in Table 43.

The HR for a first event for the AC → TH arm relative to the AC → T arm was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.77; p&lt;0.0001). The HR for a first event for the DCarbH arm relative to the AC → T arm was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.83; p&lt;0.0003).

Most DFS events were distant relapses occurring as multiple liver, bone, and lung lesions. There was a reduction in the number of distant relapses in both Herceptin-containing arms relative to the AC-&gt;T arm with the exception of distant metastases to the central nervous system.

Very few deaths (AC → T: 5; AC → TH: 5; and DCarbH: 7) occurred without a prior relapse or second primary cancer.

A Kaplan-Meier plot for DFS is shown in Figure 1.

## Secondary Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS)

At  the  time  of  the  second  interim  analysis,  deaths  had  been  reported  for  185  patients.  Of  these patients, 80 were in the AC → T arm, 49 were in the AC → TH arm, and 56 were in the DCarbH arm.

There  was  an  increase  in  duration  of  OS  among  patients  in  each  of  the  Herceptin-containing  arms compared with the AC → T arm (see Table 5 and Figure 2). The hazard ratio of 0.58 (95%-CI: [0.40, 0.83), p = 0.0024) indicates a 42% risk reduction in the AC → TH arm.

Of  the  3222  randomized  patients,  922  (28.6%)  were  classified  as  being  high-risk  node-negative. Among all randomized node-negative patients, there was a 64% risk reduction (HR= 0.36 ;95% CI: 0.19, 0.68; p &lt;0.0010)  for a first event for the AC-&gt;TH arm relative to the AC-&gt;T arm compared to a 33% risk reduction (HR=0.67;  95% CI: 0.53, 0.85; p &lt;0.0008), among all randomized node-positive patients. Similarly, among all randomized node-negative patients, there was a 48% (HR=0.52; 95%

Additional analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint benefit (DFS) in all clinically important subgroups, including those defined by age, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, nodal status, tumor size, tumor  histopathology,  nuclear  grade,  and  surgery  or  radiation  therapy,  were  consistent  with  the treatment effect in the overall population (see Table 6). There was no indication that trastuzumab is not effective in one of the specified subgroups. Furthermore analyses looking at the different events contributing to DFS are shown in Table 6.

b Stratified log-rank p-value a Relative to the AC-&gt;D arm. Estimated using Cox regression stratified by number of positive nodes and hormone receptor status

In study BCIRG 006, 213/1075 patients in the DCarbH (TCH) arm , 221/1074 patients in the AC → DH (AC → TH)  arm,  and  217/1073  in  the  AC → D  (AC → T)  arm  had  a  Karnofsky  performance  status ≤ 90 (either  80  or  90).  No  disease-free  survival  (DFS)  benefit  was  noticed  in  this  subgroup  of  patients (hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% CI [0.73, 1.83] for DCarbH (TCH) vs AC → D (AC → T);  hazard  ratio  0.97, 95% CI [0.60, 1.55] for AC  DH (AC  TH) vs AC  D).

In addition, data comparing the efficacy of concurrent trastuzumab treatment (AC → PH) to sequential trastuzumab  treatment  (AC → P → H)  from  the  NCCTG N9831  study  (alone)  were  presented.  The  data cut-off  for  this  analysis  was  November  3,  2009.  At  this  time,  50%  of  the  planned  number  of  DFS events  required  for  the  final  analysis  of  the  NCCTG  N9831  study  itself  had  occurred  (312  actual events).  A total of 1903 patients were included (patients who had been randomized to AC → T → H when arm AC → T+H was temporarily closed were excluded).  The median follow-up duration was 5.3 years and 75% of patients had been followed for 5 years.

After 5 years, 84.2% of patients in the concurrent arm (AC  T+H) had not experienced a DFS event compared to 79.8% of patients in the sequential arm (AC  T  H).  There was a 25% reduction in the risk  of  a  DFS  event  when  trastuzumab  was  administered  concurrently  with  paclitaxel as  opposed  to sequential  administration  after  paclitaxel  (unadjusted  HR = 0.77  [0.61;  0.96];  log-rank  p = 0.019). However, the boundary for statistical significance had been preset at p = 0.00116 and so this result was not statistically significant but was considered a strong trend (see Figure 4).  After adjusting for tumour size, number of positive nodes, and ER, the HR was 0.75 [0.60-0.94)].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  survival  did  not  differ  significantly  between  patients  in  the  AC → T → H  arm  compared  to  the AC  T+H arm (unadjusted HR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.59, 1.08] log rank p = 0.135) at that time.

## 3.3.2.1. METHODS

## Study Participants

Study B-31 enrolled women with HER2-positive, early-stage, node-positive breast cancer. Study N9831 enrolled women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence.

Key inclusion criteria for both trials were:

-  Pathologic  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  with  strongly  positive  (3  +)  HER2  protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry or HER2  gene  amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization
-  Histologically  confirmed  node-positive  disease or (Study  N9831  only  following  the  May  2003 amendment) high-risk node-negative disease (defined as tumor size &gt; 1 cm and estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR] negative, or tumor size &gt; 2 cm regardless of hormone receptor status)

- -≤ 84 days (12 weeks) between surgery and randomization

## Treatments

The treatment regimens in both studies were as follows:

<!-- image -->

A=doxorubicin; C=cyclophosphamide; qwk=every week; q3wk=every 3 weeks.

- aStudy B-31 was amended to allow weeklypaclitaxel in May 2003.

All  patients  received  four  3-week  cycles  of  AC  chemotherapy  followed  by  paclitaxel  for  12  weeks. Patients  randomized  to  Arm  2  of  Study  B-31  or  Arm  C  of  Study  N9831  began  Herceptin  therapy concurrently with paclitaxel. The total duration of Herceptin therapy was 52 weeks.

Patients in Study B-31, received four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2 IV push, concurrently with IV cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes. After completion of these four cycles, patients received paclitaxel IV for four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) at 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours, or  weekly  for  12  weeks  at  80  mg/m2  over  1  hour  (weekly  administration  of  paclitaxel  was  allowed following  a  protocol  amendment  in  May  2003;  investigators  chose  the  paclitaxel  regimen  at randomization).

Patients in Study N9831 received four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2 IV push, concurrently with IV cyclophosphamide  at 600  mg/m2  over  20-30  minutes  (the  latter  was administered with 250 mL of normal saline). After completion of these four cycles, patients received paclitaxel IV weekly for 12 weeks at 80 mg/m2 (with 250 mL or D5W or normal saline) over 1 hour.

Herceptin was administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The initial (loading) dose was 4 mg/kg; subsequent weekly doses were 2 mg/kg.

## Objectives

## Primary Objective:

-  To evaluate the efficacy of weekly Herceptin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer, as measured by disease-free survival (DFS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  Herceptin  plus  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone,  as evidenced by the incidence and severity of cardiac and non-cardiac events

Secondary objective:

-  To determine the efficacy of weekly Herceptin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer, as measured by overall survival

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the  analysis  was  disease-free  survival  defined  as  the  time  from randomization  until  the  first  occurrence  of  any  of  the  following  events:  local,  regional,  or  distant recurrence  of  breast  cancer;  development  of  a  contralateral  breast  cancer  or  other  second  primary cancer (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast); or death from any cause. DFS for patients who were not known to have experienced any of these events was censored at the date of the last available follow-up assessment.

An annual history and physical examination (including pelvic examinations and annual mammography) were required in each protocol. Other evaluations, such as a bone scan, were done if clinically indicated to  rule  out  disease  progression.  Patients  who  were  felt  to  have  signs  or  symptoms  of  disease progression at any time during treatment were evaluated with appropriate radiographic tests (chest Xray, computed tomography [CT] scan, etc). All patients who had evidence of disease progression were contacted at least annually for survival status.

Other  efficacy  endpoints  included  time  to  first  distant  recurrence,  time  to  central  nervous  system metastases, and additional exploratory analysis.

For study BCIRG 006, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy results.  These included sensitivity analyses in which the definition of DFS was changed by excluding certain sub-categories from the endpoint eg excluding second primary cancers, non-breast cancer second primary cancers, or distant recurrences.  For each of these endpoints, time to event was the time from randomization to the occurrence of the event, irrespective of all intervening events.

## Sample size

The sample size of the joint analysis including patients from Arms 1 and 2 of Study B-31 and patients from Arms A and C of Study N9831 was calculated in order to detect a 21.6% reduction in DFS events with  about  90%  power  in  a  log-rank  test  applying  a  significance  level  of  0.025  (one-sided).  These assumptions resulted in 710 events to be observed.

The  first  interim  analysis  of  the  combined  data  set  was  planned  when  (overall)  a  total  of  355  DFS events had been observed; subsequent interim analyses were to be presented semi-annually. The trial could be stopped at any interim analysis in case the null-hypothesis of no treatment difference was rejected  at  a  nominal  one-sided  0.0005  level.  In  case  the  trial  stopped  not  at  one  of  the  interim analyses, the final significance level had to be calculated using a method of  -spending to ensure a global  of 0.025 (one-sided).

## Randomisation

Treatment allocation in both trials was done by means of dynamic randomisation. Stratification factors for study B-31 where: number of positive nodes, planned hormonal therapy, surgery/radiation therapy, institution  and  intended  frequency  of  paclitaxel  application.  Balancing  was  based  on  the  variance method  as  described  by  White  and  Freedman  (1978).  In  study  N9831  a  dynamic  randomization scheme  according  Pocock  and  Simon  (1975)  stratifying  for  cooperative  group,  nodal  status,  and receptor status was applied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

Both studies were open label trials.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  ITT  population  according  to  the  randomised  treatment assignment. All patients from study B-31 were included. From study N9831 patients from arms A and C were included. To account for a temporary suspension of enrolment in Arm C of Study N9831, only patients in arm A who were enrolled concurrently with arm C were included.

Time  to  event  endpoints  were  compared  by  means  of  a  log-rank  test,  the  impact  of  pre-specified covariates was assessed by means of COX regression. For DFS and OS respectively the analyses were stratified for study (B-31, N9831), intended paclitaxel schedule (weekly, every 3 weeks), pathological nodal status (0, 1-3, 4-9, 10+ positive nodes) and hormone receptor status (ER-positive and/or PRpositive,  ER-negative  and  PR-negative).  In  addition  the  results  of  an  unstratified  log-rank  test  were also provided. In case a statistical significant difference was observed for DFS a supportive OS analysis had to be performed. To control the Type I error at  = 0.025 (one-sided) an O'Brien-Fleming error spending function (with 710 deaths=100% information) was be applied. Observed treatment effects were  described  by  means  of  95%  confidence  intervals.  Specific  measures  (outlined  below)  were planned  to  account  for  the  multiplicity  issues  arising  from  the  interim  analyses  and  multiple  group comparisons.

To assess the homogeneity of treatment effects, several subgroup analyses were pre-planned (e.g. age, race, performance status, pathologic node positive, pathologic tumor size etc). Various analyses were planned to assess the poolability of patients from both trial with regard to DFS and OS respectively. The  first  interim  analysis  of  the  combined  data  set  was  planned  when  (overall)  a  total  of  355  DFS events had been observed; subsequent interim analyses were to be presented semi-annually. The trial could be stopped at any interim analysis in case the null-hypothesis of no treatment difference was rejected  at  a  nominal  one-sided  0.0005  level.  In  case  the  trial  stopped  not  at  one  of  the  interim analyses, the final significance level had to be calculated using a method of  -spending to ensure a global  of 0.025 (one-sided).

## Conduct of the study

As of March 2005, clinical cut off date for the CSR, there were 10 amendments for study B-31 and 15 for  N9831.  The  amendments  were  largely  refinements  of  the  original  protocol  and  improved  the definition  of  the  patient  population  (e.g.  HER2  central  confirmation)  and  the  safety  of  patients  (e.g. exclusion criteria for cardiac disease). The most substantial amendment was the decision to close the study at interim analysis and offer all patients Herceptin treatment.

## Baseline data

Patients  were  mainly  enrolled  in  the  United  States.  There  were  no  notable  imbalances  between treatment  arms  for  any  of  the  demographic  characteristics.  The  mean  age  of  women  in  the  Joint Efficacy Population was 49.3 years for the chemotherapy alone arm and 49.6 years for the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm. The two most frequently occurring racial groups for the chemotherapy alone arm and the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm were Black (7.3% in the chemotherapy alone arm; 7.2% in the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm) and White (83.7% in the chemotherapy alone arm; 83.4% in the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm). The median weight was 72.0 kg for the chemotherapy alone arm and 70.8 kg for the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm. ECOG status in Study B-31 was 0 for 92% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm and 94% of the patients in the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm; ECOG status was not collected in Study N9831.

A  total  of  61.7%  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  62.4%  in  the  Herceptin  + chemotherapy arm had a mastectomy. Nodal involvement was similar in the two treatment arms, with 6.1% and 5.3% of patients having 0 nodes involved and 14.2% and 13.7% of patients having 10 + nodes  involved  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  and  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  arms,  respectively.  Only Study N9831 allowed enrolment of node-negative patients. The majority of women were ER-positive and/or  PR-positive:  55.9%  for  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  55.3%  for  the  Herceptin  + chemotherapy arm.

Populations were generally well balanced. A slight overrepresentation of tumors &gt; 2 cm is noted in the Herceptin  group  (58.9%  vs.  62%).  Compared  to  the  HERA  trial  this  patient  population  is  more homogenous as a defined chemotherapy protocol including doxorubicin and paclitaxel was mandatory. Compared to HERA there are more patients with node positive disease which is generally regarded as being associated with worse prognosis.

11 patients assigned to AC-&gt;T and 4 patients assigned to AC-&gt;T+H were recorded as HER2 negative in the joint efficacy population.

A total of 152 patients in Studly N9831 assigned to Arm A from 1 February to 3 September 2002 while Amm C was closed to enrollment were excluded from analysis. Patients already in Arm C had the option of starting Herceptin following paclitaxel while Arm C was closed to enrollment.

A = doxorubicin; C= cyclophosphamide; CSR= clinical study report; H= Herceptin; NEJM= New England Joumal of Medicine; T= paclitaxel. In Study B-31, 11 patients were enrolled shortly after the interim analysis of efficacy and were not randomized; all received treatment in the Herceptin arm; in Study N9831, 283 patients were removed from the randomization database because the central pathology review did not confirm HER2-positive status.

Randomized as of 1 November 2004 in Study N9831 and enrolled as of 29 April 2005 in Study B-31.

was derived from this population.

Safety-evaluable refers to patients who received at least one dose of the indlicated treatment.

B-31 patients with at least one follow-up assessment for disease recurrence; excludes 1 patient (710693022) who was found to have had a distant recurrence at randomization and therefore was not at risk for a DFS event. N9831 patients with at least one follow-up of any type.

Patient 2316 (Arm A) received seven cycles of Herceptin.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint DFS of the joint analysis at the time of the interim analysis is shown in Table 7 and Figure 2. The p-value for the hazard ratio crossed the pre-specified early-reporting boundary of 0.001 (nominal 0.0005 one-sided) for DFS. As a result, the DMCs of both cooperative groups independently recommended closing the studies to accrual and offering Herceptin to eligible patients in the chemotherapy alone arms.

This first interim analysis, which was planned to take place after 355 DFS events had been reported (i.e.  50%  of  the  total),  was  conducted  in  April  2005  (median  follow-up:  1.8-2.0  years;  data  cut-off March 15, 2005).  At this time, 394 events had been actually reported.

Updated results from the addendum confirm the results observed at interim analysis.

An  updated  joint  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  when  all  patients  had  had  at  least  18 months  of follow-up  from  the  initiation  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  (median  follow-up  &gt; 3  years  for  the  joint efficacy  population  and  &gt; 3.5 years  for  the  joint  safety  population).  At  this  time,  747 patients  had experienced a DFS event: 475 in the AC → P arm and 272 in the AC → PH arm. Results in DFS confirmed the results observed at the interim analysis.

## Secondary endpoint

Overall  survival  was  the  secondary  endpoint  for  the  joint  analysis  (see  Table  8  and  Figure  3).  The O'Brien-Fleming α -spending  function  was  used  to  control  the  type  I  error.  With  approximately  22% information (154  deaths,  and  100% information occurring at 710 deaths for the final analysis), the formal boundary for statistical significance for overall survival at this interim analysis was 1.5 x 10 -6 .

An updated joint analysis of studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 (submitted as an addendum) in which all patients had at least 18 months of follow-up from the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (median duration of follow-up &gt; 3 years) confirmed the efficacy results of the first interim joint analysis.

## 3.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy

The joint analysis of B-31 and N9831 has demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant Herceptin following the adjuvant chemotherapy combination of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel. Efficacy has also been demonstrated for the combination of Herceptin, carboplatin and docetaxel as administered in the third arm of the BIRG006 trial as well as the in combination with docetaxel following administration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. A statistically significant and substantial increase in DFS and OS was achieved with the concurrent addition of 52 weeks of trastuzumab to taxanes (either weekly or 3weekly paclitaxel or 3-weekly docetaxel) following doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide. .

In the joint analysis of the NCCTG 9831 and NSABP B-31 trials, the addition of Herceptin to paclitaxel chemotherapy resulted in a 52% decrease in the risk of disease recurrence (primary endpoint, DFS). The  hazard  ratio  translates  into  an  absolute  benefit,  in  terms  of  3-year  disease-free  survival  rate estimates of 11.8 percentage points (87.2 % vs 75.4 %) in favour of the AC → PH (Herceptin) arm. At the time of a safety update after a median of 3.5-3.8 years follow up, an analysis of DFS reconfirms the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  shown  in  the  definitive  analysis  of  DFS.  Despite  the  cross-over  to Herceptin in the control arm, the addition of Herceptin to paclitaxel chemotherapy resulted in a 52% decrease in the risk of disease recurrence. The addition of Herceptin to paclitaxel chemotherapy also resulted in a 37% decrease in the risk of death.

In the BCIRG 006 study for the primary endpoint, DFS, the hazard ratio translates into an absolute benefit, in terms of 3-year disease-free survival rate estimates of 5.8 percentage points (86.7 % vs 80.9 %) in favour of the AC → DH (Herceptin) arm and 4.6 percentage points (85.5 % vs 80.9 %) in favour of the DCarbH (Herceptin) arm compared to AC → D.

The  median  follow-up  duration  of  more  than  5-years  in  study  BCIRG  006  has  shown  that  the combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy is more effective than delaying trastuzumab therapy by 3 months after the completion of the whole chemotherapy. 5-year DFS was increased from 80% with AC  T  H to 84% for AC  T+H. In addition, in study BCIRG 006, the clinical outcomes (DFS and OS)  of  the  combination  of  trastuzumab  with  an  anthracycline-containing  regimen  were  numerically (but not statistically) superior to those of the combination of trastuzumab with carboplatin + docetaxel.

The benefit of trastuzumab appeared greater in node-negative than in node-positive patients, with an HR estimate as low as 0.36 for the AC → T+H regimen although confidence intervals were large. The results were essentially the same for both adjuvant regimens (AC  T+H and DCarbH) in node-positive patients.  Interestingly, in this group of node-positive patients, trastuzumab did not show any evidence of  effect  at  local/regional  sites,  only  at  distant  sites.    Importantly,  there  was  no  difference  in  CNS metastases between the three treatment arms.

Adjuvant trastuzumab is part of a treatment strategy that also involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  At  present  it  is  not  clear  which  of  the  employed  chemotherapy  protocols  is  best  in combination with trastuzumab. Although not statistically significant, there was a consistent numerical benefit  of  the  anthracycline-containing  regimen  and  concurrent  trastuzumab  administration  over  the anthracycline-free regimen.  The clinical relevance of this difference is unknown.

Using HR for the primary endpoint generated from the trials gives the following order:

| AC-PH (B-31 subgroup, mostly 3-weekly P) 0.44   |   AC-PH (B-31 subgroup, mostly 3-weekly P) 0.44 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| AC-PH (B-31 and N9831 joint)                    |                                            0.48 |
| AC-PH (N9831 subgroup, weekly P)                |                                            0.54 |
| Any approved chemotherapy (HERA)                |                                            0.54 |

Study populations were not easily comparable, for example HERA allowed the inclusion of node negative patients if considered at high risk by tumor size of &gt; 1cm; in B-31 and N9831 (until amendment) had as inclusion criterion only node positive disease. On the other hand HERA may have employed chemotherapy protocols that are not regarded as optimal today.

In order to further study the benefits of trastuzumab in this setting the MAH has committed to provide the data on the follow up efficacy analyses of all three trials as a follow up measure.

## 3.4. Clinical safety

The joint safety database from B-31 and N9831 was based on data from all patients who had at least 18 months of follow-up from the initiation of their adjuvant chemotherapy (both arms from NSABP B31 and two of the three arms from NCCTG N9831). The safety data for BCIRG006 were based on the second planned interim efficacy analysis. This analysis was conducted after a median follow-up of 36 months using a database cut-off date of November 01, 2006.

In addition, a cardiac safety update to the BCIRG006 CSR was provided based on the data available when the last patient enrolled had been followed for at least 5 years. The clinical data cut-off date for this update was October 16, 2009 when the median follow-up duration was approximately 66 months (5.5 years).

Safety in the joint analysis was analysed in two subsets

-  Safety-evaluable  patients  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  protocol treatment.  Treatment  exposure  and  deaths  were  evaluated  in  this  population.  All  safetyevaluable patients were also considered to be evaluable for cardiac safety.
-  AE-evaluable patients included safety-evaluable patients for whom an Adverse Event CRF had been submitted and entered into the database prior to the data cut-off date. Routinely reported AEs were evaluated in this subset.

In the BCIRG006 study, the safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

## Patient exposure

The median duration of trastuzumab treatment was close to one year in all trastuzumab-containing arms; 356 days in the NSABP B-31 study and 322 days in the NCCTG N9831 study and 378 days for both the AC → DH and DCarbH regimens in the BCIRG006 study. The majority of patients received the planned dose at each cycle and the median dose intensity was close to 1.0 in all groups.

At the time of the joint analysis, 51.3% and 40.3% of the patients in the AC → PH arms of the NSABP B31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies,  respectively,  had  completed  the  planned  duration  of  trastuzumab monotherapy  per  protocol,  and  similarly  75.3%  in  the  AC → DH  arm  of  the  BCIRG006  study.  More patients completed trastuzumab therapy (86.5%) in the DCarbH arm of the BCIRG006 study.

Exposure to trastuzumab in the safety population is shown in Table 11.

Events are presented in descending order of frequency in the AC—→DH arm.

## Serious adverse event

Serious  adverse  events  were  not  reported  in  the  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies.  Instead, certain  adverse  events  were  reported  via  the  NCI's  Adverse  Event  Expedited  Reporting  System (AdEERS),  as  specified  in  each  protocol.  Expedited  reporting  of  adverse  events  via  AdEERS  was required  for  patients  in  the  experimental  (trastuzumab-containing)  arms  of  each  study  who  had received at least one dose of trastuzumab, but not in the control arms. The most commonly reported events in the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, respectively, were left ventricular failure (0.8%, 1.9%),  infection  (1.3%,  2%),  dyspnoea  (1.1%,  1.2%),  pneumonitis  (0.7%  in  both  studies),  and thrombosis (0.6%, 1.1%).

Serious AEs were collected and analyzed in the BCIRG006 study according to standard ICH criteria.

Serious non-cardiac AE occurring in ≥ 1% of patients and serious cardiac AE occurring at any time in BCIRG006 are shown in Tables 14 and 15, respectively.

## Significant adverse events: Cardiac safety

Cardiac safety was assessed in the three studies using the following parameters:

- Cardiac events
- Cardiac deaths
- Asymptomatic LVEF events

The  numbers  and  percentage  of  patients  with  evidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  (defined  as  cardiac events, cardiac deaths and asymptomatic LVEF events) were summarized by treatment group and by individual study periods.

The following definitions of cardiac death were used:

In  studies  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  cardiac  deaths  were  defined  as  deaths  due  to  CHF, myocardial infarction,  or  primary  arrhythmia  as  well  as  sudden  death  without  documented  etiology. These  were  reported  on  a  Cardiac  Report  Form  in  the  NSABP  B-31  study  and  on  a  Cardiac  Death Report  Form  in  the  NCCTG  N9831  study.  These  deaths  were  reviewed  and  confirmed  by  each respective  cardiac  study  committee.  Cardiac  deaths  were  summarized  by  treatment  as  received  for each study and for the joint safety population.

In study BCIRG006 cardiac deaths were reviewed and confirmed by the Independent Cardiac Review Panel (IRCP); they were defined as death due to one of the following:

- confirmed congestive heart failure
- myocardial infarction
- documented primary arrhythmia
- probable cardiac death ie, sudden death without documented etiology.

An autopsy was preferred in cases where cause of death had a cardiac etiology.

The following definitions of asymptomatic LVEF events were used:

In studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 an asymptomatic LVEF event was defined as an absolute drop in LVEF of 10% to &lt; 55% (eg, from 64% to 54%) or an absolute drop in LVEF of 5% to below the institution's LLN. Scheduled LVEF assessments were to be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 18 months following randomization.

In study BCIRG006 an asymptomatic absolute decline of &gt; 15% in LVEF from baseline and to a value below  the  LLN  was  considered  a  clinically  significant  asymptomatic  LVEF  event.  Scheduled  LVEF assessments were to be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 18 months following randomization.

## Cardiac Events

Cardiac  events  reported  in  the  safety  population  of  studies  B-31,  N9831  and  BCIRG006  are summarised in Tables 18 and 19.

a A patient could be included in more than one event type category; therefore, the \"any symptomatic cardiac event\"row is less the sum of number of events in a given column.

Exploratory  analyses  of  risk  factors  for  cardiac  events  (NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies) demonstrated  that trastuzumab  therapy, older age, prior or current use of antihypertensive medications at baseline, low LVEF prior to or following initiation of paclitaxel and LVEF value &lt; 55% at least 28 days prior to the event were significant predictors of a cardiac event. In the AC → PH arm, the risk of a cardiac event increased with the number of these risk factors present, from an incidence of 0.8% when no risk factors were present to 13.0% when all three risk factors were present. When all three risk factors were present in the AC → P arm, the incidence of cardiac events was 4.8%.

For study BCIRG006, treatment with AC → DH, decreased on-study LVEF and older age (&gt; 50 years) were identified  as  key  risk  factors  for  development  of  a  symptomatic  cardiac  event.  Patients  in  the AC → DH arm had an estimated 3.75-fold higher risk of a cardiac event compared with patients in the AC → D arm.

Findings were similar in the 18-month update to the joint analysis NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831 and the 5-year cardiac update to the BCIRG006 study.

## Cardiac Deaths

In studies B-31 and N9831, there were 12 cardiac deaths: 2 patients treated with AC → T + H and 10 treated with AC → T (6 randomised to AC → T → H and 4 randomised to AC → T).  In study BCIRG006 one patient who developed atrial fibrillation and heart failure with cardiomyopathy eventually died in the AC → T group.

## Asymptomatic drop in LVEF

The  incidence  of  asymptomatic  LVEF  declines  was  higher  in  the  trastuzumab  groups  than  in  the chemotherapy only group (see Figures 4 and 5)

## Longer term data on cardiac events

For  the  joint  analysis  (NSABP B-31  and  NCCTG N9831),  patients  who  developed  cardiac  dysfunction are patients who had any cardiac event, defined as symptomatic CHF (non-death) or cardiac death; or patients with an asymptomatic LVEF event defined as an absolute drop of LVEF of 10% compared with baseline to below 55% or an absolute drop in LVEF of 5% compared with baseline to below the LLN.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 463, 743 and 126 patients who developed cardiac dysfunction in the AC  P, AC  PH and AC  P  H arms.

Figure 6 presents mean LVEF over time for this subgroup of patients based on the database supported 18-month safety update, in the Joint Analysis study, starting from the doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) baseline. The mean AC baseline was similar between the trastuzumab groups and the AC  P (AC  T) group in this subgroup of patients. In the AC  PH (AC  TH) patients, the largest mean absolute percentage point decrease from baseline was seen at 9 months, similarly to the mean LVEF  over  time  for  all  patients.  In  the  AC  P  H  (AC  T  H)  group,  the  largest  mean  absolute percentage point decrease from baseline was seen at 18 months, similarly to the whole population.

Patients who developed Cardiac Dysfunction are patients with any cardiac event where cardiac event is defined as symptomatic CHF (non-death) or cardiac death or patients with ani asymptomatic LVEF event defined as an absolute drop of LVEF of 10% compared with baseline to below 55% or an absolute drop in LVEF of 5% compared with baseline to below the LLN. All of the LVEF methods were combinedl.

Figure 6. Joint analysis (NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831) study: Mean LVEF for patients who developed cardiac dysfunction

For the BCIRG006 study, patients who developed cardiac dysfunction were defined as patients with any cardiac event where cardiac event, defined as Grade 3 or 4 symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), Grade 3 or 4 myocardial infarction, or cardiac death; or patients with an asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) event, defined as an absolute decline of &gt; 15% in LVEF from baseline and to a value  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN).  There  were  45,  115  and  47 patients  who  developed cardiac dysfunction in the AC  D (AC  T), AC  DH (AC  TH) and DCarbH (TCH) arms, respectively.

Figure 7 presents the mean LVEF over time for those patients in the BCIRG006 study. There was a general decrease in LVEF values across treatment arms from baseline to the 3-month evaluation for this subgroup of patients. The mean of the largest absolute decline in LVEF values in trastuzumab arms was at the 9-month evaluation.

Figure 7. Study BCIRG006: Mean LVEF for Patients who Developed Cardiac Dysfunction

The data showed that in patients who develop cardiac dysfunction the drop in LVEF associated with combined trastuzumab therapy returned to a level that was consistent across the treatment arms of all three  studies,  however  it  did  not  return  to  a  normal  level  after  completion  of  study  treatment.  In conclusion, the data did not show a recovery of the cardiac function after treatment with Herceptin.

## Disease progression and cardiac dysfunction (post-hoc, exploratory analysis)

The MAH performed an exploratory, post-hoc combined analysis of disease progression (disease-free survival  events)  and  symptomatic  cardiac  events)  on  the  datasets  that  were  the  basis  for  the  joint analysis (JA) NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831 and BCIRG006 clinical study reports (CSRs), respectively.

The following definitions of asymptomatic cardiac events were used in the individual study protocols:

-  NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831: absolute drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10% to &lt; 55% or absolute drop in LVEF of 5% to below the institution's lowest limit of normal (LLN).
-  BCIRG006: absolute decline in LVEF of &gt; 15% from baseline and to a value below the LLN.

As  the  LLN  of  each  participating  institution  was  used  as  baseline  not  a  single  one  threshold  for 'baseline'  can  be  defined  for  the  requested  analysis,  rendering  it  not  possible  to  apply  a  common definition of asymptomatic events across all studies.

In the joint analysis NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831, the primary analysis comprised 394 DFS events; of these,  261 events  were  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  133 events  in  the  trastuzumab  plus chemotherapy  arm.  When  cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  events)  was  also included, the combined analysis comprised 1173 events; of these, 532 events were in the chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  641 events  in  the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm.  The  earliest contributing events by treatment arm, hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) are also summarized in Table 22. It is noted that the large majority of contributing events for the combined analysis were asymptomatic cardiac events.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

In the B-31 and N9831 trials the incidence of haematological toxicities was higher in the AC → PH arm compared with the AC → P arm (38.6% vs 34.6% for any grade AEs in NSABP B-31; 33.1% vs 27.1% Grade 3-5 AEs in NCCTG N9831). The most frequent events were decreased haemoglobin (in NSABP B31 only), decreased leukocytes and decreased neutrophils. These occurred with a higher incidence in the  AC → PH  arm  compared  with  the  AC → P  arm.  However,  for  Grade  3-5  toxicities,  the  differences between the trastuzumab-containing and control arms were small in the NSABP B-31 (&lt; 1%). In the NCCTG  N9831  study,  a  higher  incidence  of  neutropenia  was  observed  in  the  AC → PH  arm  (32.1%) compared  with  the  AC → P  arm  (25.8%);  this  correlated  with  the  increased  incidence  of  febrile neutropenia in the AC → PH arm (7.2% vs 3.5%).

In BCIRG006 study the incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia and leucopenia was higher in the AC → DH arm (71.3% and 60.1%, respectively) compared with the AC → D arm (63.1% and 51.4%, respectively) (see  Table  26).  However,  the  incidence  of  neutropenic  infection  and  febrile  neutropenia  was  only slightly higher in the AC → DH arm compared to the AC → D arm. The incidence of Grade 3/4 anemia, neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in  the  DCarbH  arm  (5.8%,  65.9%  and  5.4%, respectively)  compared  with  the  AC → D  arm  (2.5%,  63.1%  and  1.0%,  respectively).  However,  the incidence of neutropenic infection and febrile neutropenia was very similar in the DCarbH and AC → D arms.  More  patients  in  the  DCarbH  arm  received  prophylactic  treatment  with  granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) during the first 5 cycles of treatment but by Cycle 6, the frequency of G-CSF use  was  similar  in  the  three  arms  (32.6%  in  AC → D,  34.6% in  AC → DH and 30.6% in DCarbH) and overall, fewer patients in the DCarb H arm (40.5%) used G-CSF during the study than in the AC → D (45.8%) and AC → DH arms (46.7%).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  of  study  chemotherapy  or  trastuzumab  monotherapy  were collected in the BCIRG 006 study.  Non-cardiac AEs led to discontinuation of chemotherapy in a similar proportion of patients in each of the anthracycline treatment groups (AC → T 4.2% and AC → T+H 3.6%) and  in  fewer  patients  in  the  DCarbH  group  (2.1%).  The  most  common  non-cardiac  AEs  leading  to discontinuation were neuropathy-sensory, fatigue, rash, and allergic reaction. Non-cardiac AEs led to withdrawal of trastuzumab monotherapy treatment in a small proportion (1.1%-1.2% of patients) in each trastuzumab group, the most common reasons being dyspnoea and fatigue

## Discontinuation due to cardiac adverse events

In Study NSABP B-31, 16% (136/844) of patients discontinued trastuzumab at any time due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In Study  BCIRG006,  a  total  of  2.9%  (31/1056)  patients  in  the  DCarbH  (TCH)  arm  (1.5%  during  the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) patients in the AC  DH  (AC  TH)  arm  (1.5%  during  the  chemotherapy  phase  and  4.2%  during  the  monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab at any time due to cardiac toxicity.

## Post marketing experience

The  estimated  cumulative  exposure  to  trastuzumab  since  September 25, 1998  via  commercially obtained drug and through clinical trials until March 24, 2010 is 815,060 patients.

Cumulatively  to  January 31, 2010,  15,920 adverse  events  reported  to  the  MAH  met  the  criteria required for inclusion in PSURs.  There were 8941 (56% of the total) serious adverse events and 6979 (44%) non-serious adverse events in a treated population.

The most frequently reported AEs were categorized under the following System Organ Classes (SOCs):

-  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (2787 events  [18%  of  the  sum  total  of  all AEs]),
-  investigations (1654 [10%]),
-  cardiac disorders (1630 events [10%]),
-  and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1529 [9.6%]).

This cumulative analysis replicates to a large extent the findings of the PSUR  covering the period from March 25, 2009 to September 24, 2009 inclusive, in which the SOCs into which adverse events were most frequently categorized were:

-  investigations: (138 SAEs [15.6% of total SAEs]),
-  cardiac disorders (127 SAEs [14.4% of total SAEs]),
-  general disorders and administration site conditions (106 SAEs [12.0% of total SAEs]).

Overall, the safety profile of trastuzumab appears to have remained essentially unchanged over time.

## 3.4.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The  data  provided  by  the  MAH  in  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  confirmed  the  known  safety profile  of  Herceptin  with  respect  to  cardiac-related  AE,  haematological  toxicity  and  pulmonary reactions. Nevertheless updated information with regard to adverse events in the early breast cancer indication has been included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and in the package leaflet.

The main findings from studies BCIRG 006, N9831 and NSABP B31 have shown that in patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events was observed when Herceptin was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy compared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was more marked when Herceptin was  administered  concurrently  with taxanes  than  when  administered  sequentially  to  taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred within the first 18 months

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and the cumulative incidence did not increase after 3 years. In addition, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  Congestive  Heart  Failure)  was  similar  in  patients  who  were administered  chemotherapy  alone  (i.e.  did not receive Herceptin)  and  in  patients  who  were administered Herceptin sequentially to a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was highest in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0%).

In  addition  it  has  been  shown  that  in  patients  who  develop  cardiac  dysfunction  the  drop  in  LVEF associated  with  combined  trastuzumab  therapy  returned  to  a  level  that  was  consistent  across  the treatment arms of all three studies; however it did not return to a normal level after completion of study treatment. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted (BCIRG006; median follow-up of 5.5 years) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic cardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane following anthracycline therapy up  to  2.37%  compared  to  approximately  1%  in  the  two  comparator  arms  (anthracycline  plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin and Herceptin). To address the recovery of  the  cardiac  function  after  treatment  with  trastuzumab  the  MAH has committed to provide further follow-up  data  on  LVEF  from  studies  BCIRG  006  and  N9831.  In  addition,  details  of  evolution  of symptomatic events and asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction with the need and changes in the treatment  of  these  events  will  be  provided  by  the  MAH  from  an  ongoing  observational  study (OHERA/BO20652) as a post-authorisation commitment.

When symptomatic cardiac events are counted in a combined analysis with disease progression events, the benefit of trastuzumab is reduced; however it remains both clinically meaningful and statistically significant in favour of the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arms.  From the data presented, it is still unclear  whether  some  patients  with  asymptomatic  LV  dysfunction  may  show  improvements  while others may progress to symptomatic LV dysfunction. Thus, long-term monitoring of cardiac safety was considered necessary and the MAH is currently addressing this through the extended follow-up of four large adjuvant trastuzumab studies and a large prospective observational study (OHERA/BO20652) to further investigate cardiac safety in 3,800 patients enrolled in a community hospital setting in Europe. A clear analysis of all asymptomatic events and their evolution over time including need for treatment is  considered necessary and will be provided by the MAH as a post-authorisation commitment.  The MAH  has  been  also  requested  to  perform  a  study  to  address  long-term  cardiac  safety  using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as a post-authorisation commitment.

In addition, the MAH has committed to provide results of sub-studies investigating markers of cardiac toxicity when available.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 3.5. Changes to the product information

The main changes agreed in the product information are summarised below (deletions in strikethrough; additions underlined).

##  Section 4.1 of the SmPC

## […] Early Breast Cancer (EBC)

Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer:

- following  surgery,  chemotherapy  (neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant)  and  radiotherapy  (if  applicable) (see section 5.1).

- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel.

- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. […]

-  Section 4.4 of the SmPC

[…]

## Cardiotoxicity

In  patients  with  EBC  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  cardiac  events was observed when Herceptin was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy compared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was more  marked  when  Herceptin  was  administered  concurrently  with  taxanes  than  when  administered sequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred within the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow up of 5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic cardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane following  anthracycline  therapy  up  to  2.37%  compared to approximately 1% in the two comparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin and Herceptin). […]

For  early  breast  cancer  patients,  cardiac  assessment,  as  performed  at  baseline,  should  be  repeated every 3 months during treatment and andevery 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the last administration. In patients who receive anthracycline containing chemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur  yearly up to 5 years from the last  administration,  or  longer  if  a  continuous  decrease  of  LVEF  is  observedat  6,  12  and  24  months following cessation of treatment.

[…]

-  Section 4.8 of the SmPC

The  frequency  of  the  adverse  reaction  'Ejection  fraction  decreased'  has  been  revised  as  'very common' (instead of common) to reflect the increased frequency observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes.

In addition the following changes were agreed in the text:

[…]

## Cardiotoxicity

[…]

- In  3  pivotal  clinical  trials  of  adjuvant  trastuzumab  given  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  the incidence  of  grade  3/4  cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  Congestive  Heart  Failure)  was  similar  in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (ie did not receive Herceptin) and in patients who were administered Herceptin sequentially to a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was highest in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0%).

[…]

## Haematology

[…]

The risk of neutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following anthracycline therapy.

This study will be run entirely in the United States of America. | Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions for Use Cardiotoxicity Heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II-IV) has been observed in patients receiving Trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see 4.8). All candidates for treatment with Trastuzumab, but especially those with prior anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiogram, or MUGA scan or magnetic resonance imaging. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to treat with Trastuzumab. In EBC, the following patients were excluded from the HERA trial, there are no data about the benefit/risk balance, and therefore treatment can not be recommended in such patients:  History of documented CHF  High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias  Angina pectoris requiring medication  Clinically significant valvular disease  Evidence of transmural infarction on ECG  Poorly controlled hypertension Formal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns following baseline screening. Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. every three months). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop |

|                 | Her-Q-Les was designed to meet two post-marketing commitments required by the FDA, namely: 1) To conduct a QT interval protocol according to the principles of ICH E14 (The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non- Antiarrhythmic Drugs), Section IID, in a minimum of 50 patients receiving trastuzumab (ICH E14 2005). 2) To perform a drug-drug interaction trial in patients with metastatic or locally advanced inoperable cancer who are positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to evaluate the impact of trastuzumab on carboplatin pharmacokinetics, and carboplatin on trastuzumab Pharmacokinetics. The study is scheduled to report in 2013. Cardiac Safety Study ML20529 A Prospective, randomized, pharmacological intervention study evaluating the effect of the angiotensin II-receptor (AT1) blocker candesartan versus placebo in prevention of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity in patients with primary breast cancer treated with trastuzumab The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of cardiotoxicity during the one- year trastuzumab therapy and during the 26 weeks after discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment, defined as a decline in LVEF (MUGA) of more than 15% or a decrease to an absolute value below 45%. This study is sponsored by the Netherlands Cancer Institute in collaboration with Astra Zeneca. Analyses will be made available to Roche as these become available. | cardiac dysfunction. For early breast cancer patients, cardiac assessment, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months during treatment and at 6, 12 and 24 months following cessation of treatment. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent monitoring (e.g. every 6-8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, but remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of Trastuzumab therapy has been seen. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with symptomatic heart failure, a history of hypertension or documented coronary artery disease, and in early breast cancer, in those patients with an LVEF of 55 %or less. The safety of continuation or resumption of Trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiotoxicity has not been prospectively studied. However, most patients who developed heart failure in the pivotal trials improved with standard medical treatment. This included diuretics, cardiac glycosides, beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Trastuzumab treatment continued on weekly therapy with Trastuzumab without additional clinical cardiac events. Trastuzumab Treatment Algorithm If LVEF drops 10 ejection points from baseline AND to below 50 %, Trastuzumab should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, discontinuation of Trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks.

Discontinuation of  Trastuzumab  therapy  should be strongly considered in patients  who  develop  clinically significant heart failure  unless the benefits for an individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks.

## Section 4.2 Method of Administration

- Trastuzumab  is  administered  as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Patients should be observed  for  at  least  six  hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related  symptoms  (see 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption of the infusion  may  help  control  such symptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate. If  the  initial  loading  dose  was well  tolerated,  the  subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute  infusion.  Emergency equipment must be available.

The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the Trastuzumab infusion should be discontinued and the patient monitored until resolution of any observed symptoms. The majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of Trastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome. Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. Therefore, these patients should |

| Oligohydramnios |  Additional Study H4621g AKA MotHER Pregnancy Registry An Observational Study Of Pregnancy And Pregnancy Outcomes In Women With Breast Cancer Treated With Trastuzumab During Pregnancy Or Within 6 Months Prior To Conception • This registry will be run entirely in the United States of America • MotHER was designed to meet a post-marketing commitment required by the FDA, namely: 1) To submit a protocol for review for a prospectively and actively enrolled pregnancy registry that will collect information assessing pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in women with breast cancer exposed to Trastuzumab-containing regimen prior to conception or during pregnancy. Annual updates from this Registry will be compiled and submitted to regulatory authorities for review annually with a Data-lock point of 31 January and appended to the PSUR. Routine | Section 4.6 Pregnancy and Lactation Reproduction studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg Herceptin and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the early ( days 20-50 of gestation) and late (days 120-150 of gestation) foetal development period was observed. It is not known whether Herceptin can affect reproductive capacity. As animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Herceptin should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been reported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Herceptin and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. |

Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions for Use Severe pulmonary events have been reported rarely with the use of Trastuzumab in the post- marketing setting (see 4.8). These rare events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, rare cases of pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been reported. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or with a delayed onset. Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events.

## 3.7. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

##  Beneficial effects

Adjuvant  trastuzumab  was  associated  with  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  on disease free survival. In the joint analysis of the NCCTG 9831 and NSABP B-31 trials, the addition of Herceptin  to  paclitaxel  chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  52%  decrease  in  the  risk  of  disease  recurrence (primary endpoint, DFS). The difference in terms of DFS in favour of the Herceptin arm was 6% or 9% at 3 years, depending on the studies. With the longest follow-up available (median of 65 months), it was estimated to be 9% at 5 years.

The effect was observed in both node-negative and node-positive tumours, and was independent of age or menopausal status, type of surgery/radiation therapy, and main tumour characteristics such as hormonal receptor status, size, or histological grade.

In addition a clinically relevant effect on overall survival has been observed. The difference in terms of OS was above 2% at 3 years in all studies and with the longest follow-up available, it was estimated to be 5% at 5 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The superiority of TCH or DCarbH treatments was also observed in one trial when compared to the control regimen (AC → T) with a difference in terms of DFS estimated to be 5% at 3 years (6% at 5 years).    The  difference  in  terms  of  OS  was  above  2%  at  3  years  and  with  the  longest  follow-up available, it was estimated to be 4% at 5 years.

Adjuvant  treatment  of  trastuzumab  given  concurrently  compared  to  trastuzumab  given  sequentially after  completion  of  chemotherapy  shortened  the  therapy  by  around  3 months  (from  18 months  to 15 months). With the DCarbH regimen the duration of intravenous adjuvant therapy is also shortened by around 3 months compared with the AC → T+H regimens and by around 6 months compared with sequential trastuzumab.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

No  uncertainties  have  been  identified  about  the  benefit  of  the  concurrent  use  of  trastuzumab  with chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, or  as  part  of  a  treatment  regimen  in  combination  with  docetaxel  and  carboplatin)  in  the  adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. All tested chemotherapy protocols in the provided randomised trials in combination with trastuzumab increased progression free survival and decreased the risk for relapse.

A direct comparison of the different chemotherapy protocols was not available. It is therefore possible that  there  are  differences  in  efficacy  for  the  different  protocols,  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  these differences are unknown. Patient risk factors may determine the choice of the regimen and should be assessed in a case by case base according to the current recommendations available in the SmPC.

## Risks

-  Unfavourable effects

Important risks that have been identified in the adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab are cardiac events including death from cardiac compromise, infection, neutropenia, infusion reactions and pulmonary reactions.

Concurrent administration of trastuzumab with a taxane increased a certain number of taxane-related toxicities, including haematological toxicities.  Most importantly, cardiac toxicity appeared worse than with sequential administration.  When  taking  into  account  both  symptomatic  CHF  events  and asymptomatic declines in LVEF, the cumulative incidence of cardiac dysfunction events - depending on the definition of LVEF decline - reached at 3 years 36% (AC → T+H) vs. 24% (for AC → T) in the B-31 and N9831 studies and 11% vs. 5%, respectively, in the BCIRG 006 study.  Results were intermediate with sequential administration.

All adverse reactions and risks associated with the treatment have been addressed adequately in the SmPC.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

It is not clear whether a true difference exists in the occurrence of cardiac events between different chemotherapy protocols in combination with trastuzumab. AE collection was not standardised and is not comparable across trials. Only one chemotherapy regimen (DCarbH or TCH) tested in BCIRG006 appears to have a considerably lower risk of cardiac events than the other protocols. It is at present unknown whether the rate of patients with cardiac compromise will continue to rise in the future. To address the recovery of the cardiac function after treatment with trastuzumab the MAH has committed to provide further follow-up data on LVEF from studies BCIRG 006 and N9831. In addition, details of evolution of symptomatic events and asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction with the need and changes in the treatment of these events will be provided by the MAH from an ongoing observational study (OHERA/BO20652) as a post-authorisation commitment.

Moreover, long-term monitoring of cardiac safety was considered necessary and the MAH is currently addressing this through the extended follow-up of four large adjuvant trastuzumab studies and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

large prospective observational study (OHERA/BO20652) to further investigate cardiac safety in 3,800 patients enrolled in a community hospital setting in Europe. The MAH has been also requested to perform a study to address long-term cardiac safety using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as a post-authorisation commitment.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

-  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Survival without recurrence of disease is of utmost importance to the patient in the adjuvant setting. The predominant short term risk, i.e. non-fatal cardiac AE, infusion reactions, infections appear less important in this context. Long term or later occurring consequences of cardiac compromise could be of  major  importance  to  the  patient  later  in  life.  Given  that  the  majority  of  patients  will  not  have  a relapse  (at  least  according  to  current  data)  the  issue  of  cardiac  damage  in  later  life  could  become increasingly important. The long-term consequences of the declines in LVEF observed after trastuzumab therapy are still not well understood while several large scale studies have proven beyond doubt that asymptomatic LV dysfunction irrespective of original injury has poor prognosis.

In  order  to  better  characterise  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  trastuzumab,  a  combined  analysis  of  DFS and cardiac dysfunction events was assessed. With beneficial effects in terms of DFS and long-lasting cardiac dysfunction, this analysis becomes even more valuable in order to better define and quantify the margin of benefit allowed by trastuzumab treatment.

In addition, the new anthracycline-free regimen proposed may decrease the long-term and life-altering toxicities (CHF or acute leukemia) of anthracycline-containing regimens.

##  Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance of addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy protocols is favourable and the beneficial effects as reflected in increased PFS and OS outweigh the unfavourable effects.

## Risk management plan

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to investigate further some of the safety concerns, no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information.

## 4. Conclusion

On 17 March 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and recommended  the agreed  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and Package Leaflet.
