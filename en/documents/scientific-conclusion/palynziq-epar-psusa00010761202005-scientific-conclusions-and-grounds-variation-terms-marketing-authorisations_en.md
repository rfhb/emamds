## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegvaliase, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of the available data on anaphylactic reactions from post-marketing sources and literature the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pegvaliase and anaphylactic reactions is at least a reasonable possibility. There were 34 reports of anaphylactic reactions received in the interval of this PSUR with 92 reports received cumulatively from the post-marketing setting. Though information is limited in some of these reports and some reports are more consistent with milder hypersensitive reactions, there is a reasonable possibility that a limited number of these reports, describing multi-system allergic manifestations requiring immediate treatment and subsequent discontinuation of treatment with pegvaliase,  represent type I hypersensitivity reactions and this possibility cannot be discounted.  Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, considered type III hypersensitivity reactions, are well-recognised for pegvaliase from the clinical development program.  It is considered that the clinical presentation and acute management of anaphylaxis and acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions are indistinguishable. The occurrence of type I anaphylactic reactions in the post-marketing setting as distinct from type III acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions cannot be ruled out and it is considered that there is value in updating the product information with anaphylaxis, signalling the need for immediate medical intervention and consideration of the need for permanent discontinuation of treatment.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegvaliase the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegvaliase is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
