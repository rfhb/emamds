## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen-Cilag International NV submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 12 November 2018 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) in combination with rituximab; as a consequence, section 4.1 and 4.8 of the SmPC is updated.  In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An updated RMP (version 12) was submitted.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Imbruvica, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1264 on 29 April 2014. Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: 'Treatment of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma'.

The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions P/0271/2014 (for capsules) and P/0297/2017 (for film-coated tablets) on the granting of product-specific waivers.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Protocol assistance

The MAH received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 18 September 2013

(EMEA/H/SAH/022/1/2013/II). The Protocol Assistance pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ibrutinib (Imbruvica, PCI-32765) is a first-in-class, potent, orally-administered, covalently binding inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK).

The European Commission has approved ibrutinib in the EU for the following clinical situations:

- IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients  with  relapsed  or refractory MCL.
- IMBRUVICA  as  a  single  agent  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously untreated CLL.
- IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.
- IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line  treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo immunotherapy.

The current Type II variation concerns an extension of indication of the approval of ibrutinib in combination of rituximab for the treatment of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), regardless of line of therapy. Proposed addition to the existing indication statement for WM is shown below in italic text:

'IMBRUVICA as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo immunotherapy. IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WM'.

## Background on the Target Indication/Current Treatment

Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct lymphoproliferative B-cell disorder characterized by infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells into the bone marrow along with demonstration of an immunoglobulin (Ig) M monoclonal gammopathy in the serum. It is a subtype of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) as defined by the Revised European-American Lymphoma and the World Health Organization (WHO) classification systems. The majority of LPL are WM. The definition WM exclude presentations of LPL associated with IgA or IgG gammopathies.

WM, which constitutes 1-2% of hematologic malignancies, is an orphan indication; the overall incidence in EU is estimated to be 7.3 and 4.2 per million among males and females, respectively and is a disease of the elderly, with incidence increasing with age, and median age being over 70 years. The most recognized risk factor for developing WM is IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance (MGUS), which confers a 46-fold higher relative risk compared to the general population.

Clinical manifestations of WM include cytopenias resulting from bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and IgM paraprotein related symptoms such as cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin syndrome, demyelinating neuropathy, and symptomatic hyperviscosity. In more rare cases, symptoms are derived from lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly/organomegaly.

WM remains an incurable disease with variability in outcome. Approximately 75% of patients are symptomatic and therefore require treatment to control symptoms related to tumor burden. Asymptomatic patients should be observed and serum IgM levels alone are not a basis for treatment.

Factors associated with a poor prognosis include advanced age (&gt;65 years); β 2-microglobulin &gt;3 mg/L; anemia (hemoglobin ≤11.5 g/dL); thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤100 x 10 9 /L); and IgM monoclonal gammopathy (IgM &gt;7.0 g/dL). Based on these key factors an international prognostic scoring system for newly diagnosed patients with WM was developed (WM IPSS score), indicating that the 5-year survival rates range from 36% to 87% in high- and low-risk patients, respectively.

An international prognostic scoring system for newly diagnosed WM patients was recently developed (Morel et al, 2009) based on 5 factors associated with a poor prognosis include advanced age, high beta 2-microglobulin (B2M), low albumin, cytopenias, serum IgM monoclonal protein, and organomegaly

## Rationale for Use of Ibrutinib in WM

Given the rarity of WM, most of the current treatment regimens have been adopted fron data derived fron phase 2 studies and less often from prospective trials addressed to WM as well as to other indolent B-cells lymphomas.

The rationale for the use of ibrutinib in this study was based on the results from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study (PCYC-04753), and an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 study (PCYC-1118E (NCT01614821) hereafter named study 1118E) that demonstrated single-agent activity in subjects with previously treated WM.

Recently, a somatic mutation of the MYD88 gene (L265P), was identified that appears to drive WM growth and proliferation. This mutation conveys tonic MYD88-interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK) signalling that activates BTK and the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are important for the growth and survival of WM cells.

Ibrutinib blocks MYD88 signalling downstream of BTK and leads to apoptosis of WM cell lines. Thus, ibrutinib specifically targets the molecular pathogenetic mechanism of WM.  The prospective, Phase 2 single arm study of ibrutinib in previously treated patients with WM, study 1118E, demonstrated clinical benefit and a favorable safety profile, which 2015 lead to approval of ibrutinib in patients with WM.

Ibrutinib is, presently, the only therapeutic agent centrally approved for the treatment of WM in the EU, both in previously treated patients and as first-line treatment in patients for whom chemo-immunotherapy is unsuitable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rituximab is not approved by in the EU for the treatment of WM, nonetheless it is the most commonly utilized agent in clinical practice, mostly in combination with chemotherapy and is recommended in European and US treatment guidelines to treat patients with treatment-naïve and previously treated WM. Monotherapy rituximab is known to exert its effect with low toxicity profile, lack of impact on the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells, non-myelosuppressive treatment profile, and response rates either as a single agent (range: 20% to 45%) or in combination regimens (70% to 90%). Rituximab monotherapy is well tolerated although transient increases in serum IgM levels (IgM flare) have been reported in approximately 50% of patients and the most common adverse events were infusion-related reactions. An extended rituximab regimen (rituximab for 4 weeks and for those without progression at week 12, 4 additional weekly infusions of rituximab) reported higher response rates (44% and 48%).

Chemo immunotherapy (CIT) is a potent therapeutic option for WM due to the additive clinical effect of rituximab with purine analogues, alkylating agents, or proteasome inhibitors However, these combination therapies are often associated with more short- and long-term toxicity, including high rates of myelosuppression and myelodysplasia, in a population already vulnerable from the symptoms associated with the underlying disease.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No new data for the environmental risk assessment were provided with this application. A complete ERA has been provided in previous procedures, and considered acceptable. For this application, the MAH has provided an updated market forecast for calculation of PEC/PNEC ratios. These ratios remain far below 1.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. From the ERA update the conclusion remains: The clinical use of ibrutinib is not expected to be a risk for the environment as there will be no significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of imbruitinib.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

## Study drug administration

In the study, treatment Arm A was administered ibrutinib (3 x 140 mg oral capsules) 420 mg/day and Rituximab (intravenous administration) 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a second four-weekly rituximab course after a three-month interval. Treatment Arm B was administered Placebo (3 capsules/day) and Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a second four-weekly rituximab course after a three-month interval.

In the open-label sub-study (Arm C) ibrutinib 420 mg/day was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Subjects were instructed to take the capsules at approximately the same time each day with 8 ounces (approximately 240 mL) of water. On day of Week 4, Day 22 PK visit (Arm A/B), ibrutinib/placebo was administered 0-30 minutes before rituximab infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Bioanalytical methods

The bioanalytical method (BTM-1792-R0) used for the measurement of ibrutinib and its metabolite PCI-452227 in study 1127 was previously assessed in application EMEA/H/C/3791/X/37. Blood samples (approximately 2 mL) were collected into Vacutainer® tubes containing sodium heparin from all subjects pre-dose. Plasma samples were stored at Frontage Laboratories at a nominal temperature of 70˚C. Samples were analysed by a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the determination of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 in heparinized human plasma. The method was validated for ibrutinib and PCI-45227 over the concentration range of 0.500 to 100 ng/mL. The plasma concentration of ibrutinib and the major metabolite, PCI-45227, were determined. An ISR evaluation for method BTM-1792-R0, using samples selected from study 1127, was conducted and met the acceptance criteria.

## Pharmacokinetic analysis

Plasma concentration data of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 from Arm A (ibrutinib + rituximab) and C (ibrutinib monotherapy) were analysed by non-compartmental methods using validated Phoenix WinNonlin software (Version 6.3). Blood samples were collected from all subjects pre-dose, at 1h (±15 min), 2h (±30 min), 4h (±30 min) and 6h (±1h) on week 4 (study day 22, treatment arm a and B) and week 5 (study day 29, treatment arm C).

All concentration values below the limit of quantitation were treated as 0 (zero) for pharmacokinetic analysis. Actual collection times relative to ibrutinib administration were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Pre-dose concentrations were applied as 24 hour concentrations in order to calculate steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for Week 4, Day 22 (Arm A) and Week 5, Day 29 (Arm C). All mean concentration data were plotted using SigmaPlot (Version 12.0).

The metabolite-to-parent (M/P) ratio for AUC and Cmax AUC was also calculated (to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors) using the following formula: (AUCPCI-45227/MWPCI-45227) / (AUCibrutinib/MWibrutinib) where MW is the molecular weight.

## Results

## Pharmacokinetic analysis

Pharmacokinetic parameters of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 in individual subjects from Arm A (Week 4, Day 22) and Arm C (Week 5, Day 29) are presented in Table 2. Individual plasma concentration versus time profiles of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 in treatment arm A and C are illustrated in Figure 1.

Following once daily oral administration of 420 mg ibrutinib in combination with rituximab (treatment arm A, week 4, day 22), the inter-subject variability for exposure parameters was 60.2% for Cmax, 59.0% for AUC0-24h, and 59.2% for AUClast. Following once daily oral administration of 420 mg ibrutinib alone (treatment arm C, week 5, day 29), the inter-subject variability for exposure parameters was 51.9% for Cmax and 60.6% for AUC0-24h and AUClast.

Two subjects in treatment arm A and one subject in Arm C were co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor during the PK collection period. Due to a limited number of subjects with evaluable PK receiving moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the effect of moderate CYP3A inhibitor use on the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 could not be evaluated.

Ibrutinib steady-state PK parameters determined by non-compartmental analysis from Study 1127 were also compared with the observations obtained in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) from Study 1102, where the ibrutinib administered dose was 420 mg/day. The results indicated that ibrutinib exposure in Study 1127 in subjects with WM was consistent with the previous studies with ibrutinib administered at 420 mg/day.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The applicant performed a multicentre, randomized double-blind study of rituximab and ibrutinib or rituximab and placebo (Arm A and Arm B, respectively) in patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia. In addition the applicant performed an open-label sub-study (Arm C) where patients received Ibrutinib as monotherapy. Results from treatment Arm A were compared with treatment Arm C. Plasma samples were not analysed for rituximab plasma concentrations, therefore, only the effect of rituximab on ibrutinib could be assessed.

No tendencies towards clinically relevant PK-interactions of rituximab on ibrutinib could be observed. Mechanistically, no interaction between rituximab and ibrutinib is expected.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

In an earlier study, study 1102, saturation of the BTK binding sites was confirmed at doses of 420 mg in the setting of CLL/SLL, why the 420 mg/day dosing regimen was chosen for ibrutinib in all subsequent clinical studies in WM (i.e. Studies 1118E and 1127). Ibrutinib monotherapy dosed 420 mg/day daily has demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile in subjects with previously treated WM, (study 1118E).

Ibrutinib at 420 mg/day, in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) has been shown to be a safe, well-tolerated and an active treatment regimen in high-risk CLL subjects.

## 2.4.2. Main study(ies)

## A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib or Placebo in Combination with Rituximab in Subjects with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.

## Methods

Study 1127 (iNNOVATE) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study in subjects with treatment-naïve and previously treated WM who received ibrutinib (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) in combination with rituximab to evaluate whether treatment with ibrutinib in combination with rituximab would result in an improvement in PFS compared with placebo in combination with rituximab.

In addition, Study 1127 included an open-label substudy (Arm C) to further investigate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects with WM who were considered refractory to the last prior Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) during the Scientific Advice procedure rituximab-containing therapy. Inclusion of this open-label monotherapy substudy was suggested by the EMEA/H/SAH/022/1/2013/II as means of obtaining data in patients with rapidly progressive disease who

were refractory to rituximab.

Result from the earlier assessed 1118E study, ibrutinib monotherapy in previously treated WM, is presented below, in parallel with the results from the main study. A formal comparison of data between subjects who received ibrutinib as combination therapy with rituximab in the frontline setting with subjects who received single-agent ibrutinib in the relapsed or refractory setting is not appropriate; however, for ease of review in this submission, the MAH has presented data from the randomized part of Study 1127, the open-label monotherapy substudy of Study 1127, and Study 1118E side-by-side in a non-pooled format.

## Study participants

## Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria for Study 1127 fulfilled general requirements for establishing a study population reflective of the target patient population. Eligible subjects were ≥18 years of age, symptomatic requiring treatment, and were required to have, untreated or previously treated, WM. Exclusion criteria for this study were chosen based on common practice in oncology studies and the safety profile of ibrutinib.

The subject selection criteria in the protocol defined the patient population, who had symptomatic disease requiring treatment based on meeting at least 1 of the recommendations from the Second International Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia for requiring treatment. The patients were also required to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria such as adequate hematological and organ function and no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that allowed evaluation of the chemotherapy-free regimen (ibrutinib+rituximab) in this population.

## Key inclusion criteria

Eligible subjects were ≥ 18 years of age with;

- Untreated WM or previously treated WM (previously treated subjects must have had documented disease
- Centrally confirmed clinicopathological diagnosis of WM in accordance with the consensus panel of the Second IWWM.
- Measurable disease defined as serum monoclonal IgM &gt; 0.5 g/dL,
- Symptomatic disease meeting at least 1 of the recommendations from the Second IWWM for requiring treatment. (See below).
- Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio levels as defined in the protocol,
- ECOG PS ≤ 2.

## Key exclusion criteria included

- Known involvement of the central nervous system by WM
- Disease refractory to prior rituximab-containing therapy (defined as relapse after the last rituximab containing therapy &lt; 12 months since last dose of rituximab), or failure to achieve at least an MR (≥ 25% reduction but &lt; 50% of serum IgM from baseline) after the last rituximab-containing therapy,
- Rituximab treatment within the last 12 months before the first dose of study drug.
- Subjects with a history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 12 months prior to enrollment, or with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, or known bleeding disorder

## Open-label Substudy

Eligible subjects must have met the inclusion criteria for the randomized study, and in addition, had disease that was refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy (defined as either relapse after the last rituximab-containing therapy &lt; 12 months since last dose of rituximab, or failure to achieve at least an MR after the last rituximab-containing therapy).

The exclusion criteria were identical to those for the randomized study except for those criteria related to prior rituximab use (outlined above for the randomized study), which did not apply to the open-label substudy.

Symptomatic disease was defined by constitutional symptoms (recurrent fever, night sweats, fatigue due to anemia, or weight loss); Presence of progressive, symptomatic lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly; anaemia (haemoglobin value of &lt;or= 10 g/dL) due to marrow infiltration; Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L due to marrow infiltration; Complications such as IgM-related hyperviscosity syndrome, symptomatic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, systemic amyloidosis, renal insufficiency, or symptomatic cryoglobulinemia may also be indications for therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

<!-- image -->

## Open-label Substudy

Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 capsules) was to be orally administered daily beginning Day 1 of Week 1. All subjects in Arms A and B received rituximab and followed the package insert for rituximab dosing and toxicity management.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors was to be avoided during the study. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor was used, the ibrutinib dose was to be reduced to 140 mg or treatment withheld temporarily for the duration of the inhibitor use. Any chemotherapy, anti-cancer immunotherapy, experimental therapy, or radiotherapy was prohibited during the treatment phase of the study.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of the addition of ibrutinib to rituximab on PFS assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) in subjects with WM. Efficacy evaluations were to be based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VIth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (IWWM).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

## Secondary Endpoints

Secondary endpoints which will be tested include the following:

- Overall response rate (ORR) assessed by IRC (≥ partial response [PR]; according to the modified VIth IWWM criteria).
- Time to next treatment (TTnT)
- Rate of sustained Hgb improvement.
- Proportion of subjects wi th ≥ 3 points increase from baseline by Week 25 in FACIT -fatigue experience score from the FACT-An 5 items assessing fatigue symptoms.
- Overall survival (OS), planned OS would not be tested at the interim analysis.

## Safety Endpoints

Safety endpoints include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and eye-related symptoms.

## Exploratory Endpoints

2. For additional clarification to assess the appearance of progression of existing nodal and extranodal disease (Refer to Section 7.5.4.)
3. Measurableextranodaldiseaseshouldbeassessedinamannersimilartothatfornodaldisease.
4. Sum of the products of multiple lymph nodes (as evaluated by CT scans) or the longest diameter of one target lymph node
5. The primary efficacy evaluations are based on IRC evaluation. In addition, eligibility for potential next-line therapy with ibrutinib will be based on IRC confirmed progression. The IRC assessment will incorporate assessments from the central radiology review and the details regarding the IRC evaluation for response and progression will be outlined in a separate charter.

Efficacy evaluation included the following components: Hematologic parameters by complete blood count; quantitative IgM serum immunoglobulins; quantitative serum-M protein; qualitative serum immunofixation / radiographic evaluation / bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (if applicable).

Determination of progression for the purpose of the primary efficacy endpoint was to be performed by the IRC. The IRC was established to conduct progression and response assessments centrally according to the committee's charter, and for subjects with nodal/extranodal disease at screening, to determine imaging requirements for the subject at follow-up visits.

The safety and the interim analysis of this study were monitored by an independent DMC.

## Sample size

## Randomized Study

The 1127 study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and was powered for this endpoint. The sample size and power calculations were based on a 2-sided log-rank test for PFS and the following considerations: 1:1 randomization ratio between 2 treatment arms; target HR of 0.5 which corresponds to a 2-fold increase in median PFS for Ibr+R arm relative to the Pbo+R arm (median PFS 30 months vs. 15 months) with exponential distribution for PFS; minimum 80% power; 2-sided overall significance level of 0.05; and 1 interim analysis at 70% information (~50 PFS events).

## Open-label Substudy

The sample size for the substudy was not determined according to statistical calculation. Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in the substudy.

## Randomisation and Blinding (masking)

Patients were centrally randomized in study 1127. The treatment assignment was stratified using the following factors:

· WM IPSS assessed at screening (low vs. intermediate vs. high).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Number of prior systemic treatment regimens (0 vs. 12 vs. ≥ 3).
- ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2).

The subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to each of the 2 treatment arms (Ibr+R arm, Pbo+R arm) within each randomization stratum. This randomization scheme was implemented within the interactive web response system (IWRS) based on information entered by clinical site staff at time of randomization. The subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor's study team members were blinded to treatment assignment.

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis of efficacy and safety, with the data extract completed on 17 October 2017 represented a pre-specified interim analysis for the randomized study was planned for 50 IRC confirmed PFS events and the final analysis was planned for 71 PFS events.

The interim analysis was based on a group sequential design with Lan-DeMets spending function with O'Brien-Fleming boundary. Using the above assumptions and based on an estimated accrual rate of approximately 12 subjects per month, the study was to enroll approximately 150 subjects (about 75 subjects to each arm) to observe 71 events in approximately 27 months from the first subject randomized. The interim analysis was conducted with 56 IRC-confirmed PFS events representing 79% of the planned total PFS events. Significance level of 2-sided alpha 0.023 for the interim analysis was determined based on the actual number of IRC-confirmed PFS events using O'Brien-Fleming boundary. This interim analysis crossed the superiority boundary and therefore is considered as the primary PFS analysis for the study, triggered by DMC recommendation after the review of interim efficacy analysis results.

Two of the 3 randomization stratification factors, WM IPSS (low, intermediate, high), and number of prior systemic treatment regimens (0, ≥ 1), were used for stratified analyses/tests. Progression -free survival per IRC assessment was summarized for each treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and compared using a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratio (HR) (Ibr+R/Pbo+R) and its 95% confidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interval (CI) based on a Cox regression model stratified by the 2 randomization stratification factors were calculated.

The primary endpoint reached statistical significance, therefore tests of secondary endpoints were performed at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 in a hierarchical order based on a closed testing procedure: 1) response rate, 2) TTnT, 3) rate of sustained Hgb improvement, and 4) proportion of subjects with ≥ 3 points increase from baseline by Week 25 in the FACIT -Fatigue subscale score. As planned, OS was not tested at the interim analysis and will be tested at the time of the final analysis.

For the open-label substudy, efficacy outcomes were analyzed separately from the randomized study. Times to event variables were analyzed using KM estimate. For categorical variables, 95% CIs were calculated based on the exact binomial distribution.

| 1 07 March 2014             | Added open-label substudy treatment arm for subjects refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy in alignment with the scientific advice received from the European Medicines Agency (subjects not suitable for Ibr+R or Pbo+R treatment in the randomized study may be enrolled into the substudy to received single-agent ibrutinib), with efficacy and safety to be descriptively summarized and analyzed separately from the randomized treatment arms. Revised inclusion criteria to allow ECOG PS status of 2. Changed a randomization factor from prior rituximab exposure (yes vs. no) to ECOG PS (O-1 vs. 2) to ensure treatment balance for subjects with ECOG PS of 2. Changed FACT-An from a secondary to an exploratory objective. |
| 2 09 February 2015          | Allowed inclusion of subjects with untreated WM. Updated the number of prior systemic treatment regimens for stratification from 1-2 vs. ≥3 to 0 vs. 1-2 vs. ≥3 to maintain balance between the 2 randomized treatment armswithregard tothe addition ofpreviouslyuntreatedsubjects. Revised the O'Brien-Fleming boundary from 60% (~42 PFS events) to 70% (~50 PFS events)fortheinterim analysisfortherandomizedarms. Added new or additional guidance or information on the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, prednisone or equivalent, P-glycoprotein substrates, dose modifications for subjects with hepatic impairment, and major hemorrhage.                                                                                                        |

## Numbers analysed

Data from the randomized part of Study 1127, the open-label monotherapy substudy of Study 1127, and Study 1118E are presented side-by-side in a non-pooled format.

The interim analysis was conducted with 56 PFS events representing 79% of the planned total PFS events.

A total of 150 subjects were included in the randomised part in Study 1127 (75 patients in each arm) and 31 subjects were included in the monotherapy sub-study.

## Outcomes and estimation

A formal comparison of data between subjects who received ibrutinib as combination therapy with rituximab in the frontline setting with subjects who received single-agent ibrutinib in the relapsed or refractory setting is not appropriate; however, for ease of review in this submission, the applicant has chosen to present

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Progression-Free Survival by IRC Assessment (Intent-to-Treat, Study 1127)

<!-- image -->

CI=confidenceinterval;Ibr+R=ibrutinib and rituximab;IRC=Independent Review Committee;mo=month; N=number; NE=not estimable; Pbo+R=placebo and rituximab; PFS=progression-free survival

Median PFS per IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC assessment at 30 months were 81.6% for the Ibr+R arm and 27.5% for the Pbo+R arm. This translates to a reduced the risk of progression or death by 80% for Ibr-R compared with Pbo+R; (HR=0.202; 95% CI: 0.107, 0.380; p &lt;0.0001).

PFS per investigator assessment was consistent with the IRC assessment (HR=0.218; 95% CI: 0.118, 0.404; p &lt;0.0001).

aRate ratio and p value are based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test stratified by WM IPSS (low, intermediate, high) and number of prior systemic treatment regimens (O,≥1) as reported in IWRS. Rate ratio &gt;1 favors Ibr+R.

The IRC assessment incorporated assessments from the central radiology revlew. CR required complete resolution of Iymphadenopathy/splenomegaly if present at baseline.VGPR andPR required reduction in lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly if present at baseline.

- -The subgroup with previously untreated patients showed 70.6% and 47.1% response rate in Ibr+R and Pbo+R arms, respectively.
- The subgroup with previously treated patients showed 73.2% and 19.5% response rate in Ibr+R and Pbo+R arms, respectively.
- The clinical response rate (cRR: including MR as well as PR, VGPR and CR) was 91.2% and 58.8% in Ibr+R and Pbo+R arms, respectively.
- -The response rate for subjects with and without the MYD88  L265P  mutation was 75.9% and 63.6% for the Ibr+R arm and 36.2% and 22.2% for the Pbo+R arm.

## Key secondary endpoint: FACIT-Fatigue Subscale Score

By week 25, 68.0% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 54.7% of subjects in the Pbo+R arm had a ≥ 3 points increase from baseline in the FACIT-Fatigue subscale score: rate ratio = 1.238 (95% CI: 0.955, 1.603), p = 0.1059.

## Key secondary endpoint: Overall Survival

OS was formaly not tested due to the low number of events.  The KM point estimate of OS rate at 30 months was 93.7% and 91.9% for the Ibr+R and Pbo+r respectively. At date of data lock there were 4 (5.3%) deaths inte the Ibr+R arm and 6 deaths (8.0%) in the Pbo-R arm.

## Exploratory analyses: Duration of respons (IRC and INV)

For responding patients, the median DOR was not reached for the Ibr+R arm while it was 21.2 months for the Pbo+R group. A landmark analysis at 24 months showed 92.2% for the Ibr+R arm and 40.8% for the Pbo-R arm.

As per investigator assessment, DOR was not reached for the Ibr+R arm, while it was 23 months for the Pbo+R group. Corresponding landmark analysis at 24 months was 89.0% versus 40.6%.

## Exploratory analyses: Clinical response rate (INV)

In contrast to response rate (RR) the clinical response rate (CRR) also includes minor response rate (MR). The CRR was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm vs. 46.7% for the Pbo+R arm.

- CRR for previously untreated patients was 91.2% for the Ibr+R arm and 58.8% for the Pbo+R arm, while CRR for previously treated patients was 92.7% for the Ibr+R arm and 36.6% for the Pbo+R arm.
- CRR for subjects with the MYD88 L265P mutation was 96.6% for the Ibr+R arm versus 48.3% for the Pbo+R arm. Corresponding CRR for subjects without MYD88 L265P mutation was 81.8% and 55.6%.

## Exploratory analyses: Hemoglobin change over time

The median Hgb increased continuously from baseline and onwards in both arms. In the Ibr+R arm median baseline Hgb was 104.5 g/L and ranged between 129.5 to 133.0 during weeks 41-97, whereas the corresponding value in Pbo+R was 99.5 g/L (baseline) raising to 127.0 to 129.0 g/L (week 41-97).

## Exploratory analyses: disease evaluations in other compartments

In study 1127, 56/75 and 58/75 patients in the Ibr+r and Pbo+R arms, respectively, presented with lymphadenopathy. Responding patients, in both treatment arms, showed reduction in lymph node volume and spleen size. The bone marrow compartment also showed a decreased percentage of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lymphoplasmacytic cells in response to treatment, compared to baseline;   the absolute number of patients in the Pbo+R arm that underwent a second bone marrow assessment was only 32 out of the 74 initial patients. The correponding numbers in the Ibr+R arm were 54/75.

## Exploratory analyses:Medical resource utilisation

In the Ibr+R arm no patients had a plasmapheresis, while 12 subjects in the Pbo+R arm had at least one (median 3.5) plasmapheresis.

The median number of subjects hospitalized, the median number of hospitalizations and the number of subjects with emergency room visits were all higher in the Ibr+R arm as compared to the Pbo+R arm.

## Exploratory analyses: Infusion related reactions

Infusion-related reactions of any grade (based on a custom SMQ) occurred in 48.0 % of subjects in the Ibr+R vs. 61.3 % of subjects in the Pbo+R arm. Grade 3 or higher event rates were 1.3 % vs. 16.0 % for the Ibr+R vs. Pbo+R arms, respectively.

## Exploratory analyses:EQ-5D-5L Visual analog scale andExploratory analyses:FACT-An assessments

The change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale and utility score using the mixed model for repeated measures showed no differences between the treatment arms. The change from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue and FACT-An scores using the mixed model for repeated measures did not show any difference between the treatment arms.

## Exploratory analyses: Biomarker

Apart from the PFS results and the RR reported for MYD88 L265P  MYD88 WT  presented above, data on the subgoups MYD88 L265P /CXCR4 WT , MYD88 L265P /CXCR4 WHIM , and MYD88 WT /CXCR4 WT  was also presented. Among baseline samples from 150 subjects in the Ibr+R and Pbo+R arms, 136 samples provided assay results.

## Demographics, open label substudy

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Ibr

(N=31)

<!-- image -->

The median age was 67.0 years (1127 randomized part: 70.0 years).

The median time since diagnosis was 91 months, (1127 randomized part:53 months).

The reported WM IPSS score was; Low: 22.6% intermediate: 35.5% and high: 41.9% (1127 randomized part: Low: 21.3% intermediate: 40.7 % and high: 38.0% ).

ECOG score 0:41.9%, 1: 38.7% and 2: 19.4 %. Compared to the randomized part where the corresponding score was 0:50.7%, 1: 42.7% and 2: 6.7%.

Number of prior treatments; 1-2: 29.0% &gt;3: 71.0%, with a median of 4 (range 1-7). The most common reason for initiating treatment was constitutional symptoms, fatigue, Hgb &lt;=10g/dL and lymphadenopathy. All patients had received rituximab the median number of prior rituximab therapies was 2 (range: 1 to 6). Medium number of prior treatments in the randomized part, study 1127, was 2.

MYD88  L265P  mutations were present in 77.4% of subjects, absent in 1 subject, and 19.4% of subjects were not evaluable for mutation status.

One subject in the open-label substudy was reported with an important protocol deviation and it is unlikely to have affected the overall efficacy and safety results of the substudy.

## Primary endpoint: Progression free survival ( Arm C , IRC and INV)

The median PFS was not reached (IRC: 95% CI: 27.4, NE; INV: 95% CI: 27.6, NE). The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC and investigator assessment for the open-label monotherapy substudy were 80.6% and 87.1% at 18 months, respectively, and 57.5% (95% CI: 38.2, 72.7) and 64.4% (95% CI: 44.9, 78.4) at 30 months, respectively.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Updated results from Study 1118 were submitted as PAM (EMEA/H/C/3791) and are presented side by side with study 1127 in the efficacy assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical studies in special populations

Please refer to subgroup analysis of PFS, on the age, gender and prior treatment status (previously treated or untreated) subgroups and in subjects with or without MYD88 mutation.

## Supportive study

The previously submitted single-arm data from Study 1118E (N=63) is presented side by side to data from the present study 1127 (N=150) and the monotherapy substudy (31); allowing for the comparison of the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab (Study 1127) or as a single agent. No formally integrated statistical analyses were performed.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

In the present CSR, key efficacy data from Study 1127 (n=150 for the rando mized part [A and B], n=31 for the openlabel monotherapy substudy [Arm C]) are presented and efficacy data from Study PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as study 1118E, N=63) are also presented as comparison. The earlier study 1118E was a single-arm, multicentre, Phase 2 study of single agent ibrutinib in adult subjects with previously treated WM, and forms the basis of the current approved WM indication in the EU SmPC.

Dose evaluation was presented in the previously assessed study 1118E. No new data is presented in the present CSR, which is acceptable.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

This application in WM is based on the results obtained in the phase 3 study 1127 consisting of a 2-armed randomised double blind study (n=150, Ibr+R vs Pbo+R) and a single arm study (n=31, monotherapy ibrutinib) with both untreated and previously treated WM (randomised part) and previously treated WM also considered rituximab refractory (monotherapy part). Efficacy data are also shown, in a side-by-side manor, with data from an earlier assessed ibrutinib monotherapy study, 1118E.

The study design was developed considering the scientific advice from regulatory agencies, including CHMP in 2014. PFS was considered an acceptable endpoint according to this advice. Due to the fact that no single substance, including rituximab, was approved for the treatment of WM, the comparator was discussed. Given the lack of truly evidenced-based therapy, rituximab was considered acceptable by CHMP as comparator and backbone therapy, acknowledging that the reference therapy would be a non-licenced comparator. However CIT (rituximab +chemotherapy) was also considered acceptable. It was suggested that subjects progressing on placebo-rituximab treatment would be able to switch to ibrutinib, given the previous approval. Furthermore, the importance of PFS2 was emphasised because of the unequal duration of treatment between arms.

In the present study (the randomised part) 54.7% of the patients had received previous treatment for WM. Subjects in the untreated cohort (n=68, 45.3%) had received no prior WM therapy; subjects in the previously treated cohort (n=82, 54.7%) had received a median of 2 prior WM therapies.

The majority of recommended therapies for WM are anti-CD-based (rituximab-based) combinations with chemotherapeutic agents or a proteasome inhibitor. The use of rituximab monotherapy, although included in European guidelines among other treatment options for relapsed patients, is associated with lower response rates compared to combination regiments and short duration of response and actually recommended only for patients with comorbidities precluding the use of more effective chemo-immunotherapies. In a recent large retrospective chart review (Lancet Haematol 2018, C Buske et

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

al) only 6% of patients received Rituximab monotherapy as first line and second line therapy. In third line setting, monotherapy rituximab was administered in 11% of the patients.

The MAH presented data on the use of monotherapy treatments, including rituximab, at the time of study design and further emphasized the wide heterogeneity in the choice of treatments and also the absence of standard of care. Rituximab was one of the most commonly used monotherapy regimens and a relatively non-toxic treatment option that provided adequate clinical responses and was therefore considered to be an appropriate comparator in both the treatment-naïve and previously treated setting. The goal to explore and chemotherapy-free treatment alternative for WM was supported by the WM Consortium Group.

Efficacy evaluation is based on the modified consensus response criteria from the VI th  International workshop for WM (NCC2014).

The sample size calculation was based on an assumption of 15 months median PFS in the control arm. The actual observed PFS was considerably longer and hence suggest that the general condition of the population is healthier than expected. The stratification factors were changed twice during the study due to changes in inclusion criteria. None of the changes to stratification factors across protocol amendments affected the balance in the randomization. No subjects were enrolled or randomized under the original protocol. Therefore, this change did not affect the balance in the randomization. Amendment 1 only allowed for inclusion of subjects with previously treated WM. In protocol Amendment 2 (dated 09 February 2015), the second randomization factor was modified to 'Number of prior systemic treatment regimens (0, 12, vs. ≥3)' and to add subjects wit h previously untreated WM. The randomization scheme #2 was then generated for the previously untreated subjects. All the previously treated subjects were randomized according to the randomization scheme #1 and all the untreated subjects were randomized according to the randomization scheme #2. The addition of untreated subjects did not affect the balance in the randomization.

The median number of prior treatments in the monotherapy cohort was 4. In Study 1118E; subjects received a median of 2 prior therapies for WM.

In Study 1127 and the open-label monotherapy substudy ~77 % of subjects had a MYD88 L265P mutation. The mutation status in Study 1118E was not available.

The recommended dose regimen for ibrutinib for WM is unchanged (ie, 420 mg administered orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) and based on earlier studies in WM and CLL/SLL.

The median age of the study population was 70.0 years for the Ibr+R arm and 68.0 years for the Pbo+R arm (range, 36 to 89 years) and the monotherapy arm was 67 years (range, 47 to 90 years). Approximately 60% of the patients were above the 65 year cut-off, with older age defining a strong adverse factor in the prognostic score. This median age corresponds rather well to the median age reported for newly diagnosed WM. The majority of the subjects were recruited from the EU (60%) and 12 % and 13 % from the US and Canada, respectively. Considering that the majority of patients recruited in the EU, a discussion on potential differences in the clinical management/therapy of WM between US and the EU region is in place.

First PFS interim analysis was positive and considered by the applicant to be the final analysis.

The protocol deviations are not considered to be of major importance for the interpretation of the study results.

Treatment was initiated in a larger proportion of patients in the control arm (Pbo+R) due to constitutional symptom(38.7% vs 25.3%); Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL (100 g/L), (37.3% vs 26.7%); fatigue (65.3 % vs 56 %); symptomatic organomegaly and/or organ tissue infiltration (9.3% vs 2.7%); IgM related immune

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemolytic anemia/trombocytopenia (5.3% vs 0%); platelet count &lt; 100x10 9  (8.0 5 vs 2.7%). More patients in the Ibr+R arm had their treatment initiated, in a larger proportion due to peripheral neuropathy (20% vs 10.7%) and serum IgM &gt;5 g/dL (24% vs 16%). Peripheral neuropathy due to serum monoclonal protein is a, however clinically significant, heterogeneous group of disorders but not always accompanied with other reasons to initiate treatment for WM, hence as reason for initiation of therapy, neuropathy is difficult to assess in the context of efficacy assessments and the study endpoints. In response to RSI, the applicant has confirmed that, although patients had their treatment initiated due to peripheral neuropathy, the subject also had to meet the other criteria including measurable disease defined as serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) &gt;0.5 g/dL. For all evaluable patients, efficacy evaluation was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VI th  International Workshop for WM (NCCN 2014), in which IgM is one of the most important factors.

The medium age for diagnosis of WM is 70 years.  The demographic characteristics of patients in study 1127 show a median age of 69 years with a median time since diagnosis just above 5 years. The median time since diagnosis in the treatment-naïve patients was 6.5 months and 94.3 months for the previously treated patients. The median age of patients included in the earlier presented study 1118E, the study which efficacy results are compared below, was 63 years.

An imbalance was seen in the subgroup &gt; 75 years, 40% and 26.7% in the Ibr+R and the Pbo+R, respectively. A majority, 78.7 % of the patients had an intermediate or high score according to IPSS for WM, which often coincide with a higher grade of disease specific symptoms. However, 50.2% and 42.7% of the patients were in ECOG 0 and 1, respectively. Presently, only medically unfit patients are recommended rituximab monotherapy, as described in ESMO guidelines.

The study population, in the randomised part, consisted of both earlier treated and untreated patients, and 54,6 % and 54,7% of the patients in the Ibr+R and Pbo+R arm, respectively, had received at least 1 (median 2) earlier line of treatment. Data on earlier treatments is provided in the attachments. An anti-CD20 antibody had been given to 87.8% of the previously treated subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 85.5% in the Pbo+R arm. Only 70% of the patients in Pbo+R completed the rituximab treatment (4 + 4 infusions during weeks 1-4 and 17-20) which strikes as an unusually low number (12% withdraw due to adverse event and 5.3% withdrawal by subject). The MAH clarified that 4 subjects withdrew their consent and 3 subjects were taken off treatment based on investigator decision. Among the 9 subjects in the Pbo+R arm who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event as compared with 2 subjects in the Ibr+R arm, 7 subjects discontinued rituximab due to infusion-related reactions, while none of the subjects in the Ibr+R arm discontinued due to an infusion-related reaction.

Treatment was initiated in a larger proportion of patients in the control arm (Pbo+R) due to constitutional symptom(38.7% vs 25.3%); Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL (100 g/L), (37.3% vs 26.7%), fatigue (65.3 % vs 56 %), symptomatic organomegaly and/or organ tissue infiltration (9.3% vs 2.7%), IgM related immune haemolytic anemia/trombocytopenia (5.3% vs 0%), platelet count &lt; 100x10 9  (8.0 5 vs 2.7%). On the other hand, more patients in the Ibr+R arm had their treatment initiated, in a larger proportion due to peripheral neuropathy (20% vs 10.7%) and serum IgM &gt;5 g/dL (24% vs 16%). Peripheral neuropathy due to serum monoclonal protein is a, however clinically significant, heterogeneous group of disorders but not always accompanied with other reasons to initiate treatment for WM, hence as reason for initiation of therapy, neuropathy is difficult to assess in the context of efficacy assessments and the study endpoints. In response to RSI, the applicant has confirmed that, howsoever patients had their treatment initiated du to peripheral neuropathy, the subject also had to meet the other criteria including measurable disease defined as serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) &gt;0.5 g/dL. For all evaluable patients, efficacy evaluation was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VI th  International Workshop for WM (NCCN 2014), in which IgM is one of the most important factors.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A pre-specified interim analysis for the randomized study was planned for 50 IRC-confirmed PFS events and the final analysis was planned for 71 PFS events. This report represents an event-driven analysis, with the data extract completed on 17 October 2017. The interim analysis was conducted with 56 PFS events representing 79% of the planned total PFS events.

The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC assessment was based on the modified Consensus Response Criteria from the VI th  International Workshop for WM. The primary endpoint is considered appropriate for both the randomised part and the monotherapy arm.

PFS per IRC assessment showed a statistically significant advantage for Ibr+R as compared with Pbo+R: and significantly reduced the risk of progression or death by 80% compared with Pbo+R; (HR = 0.202 [95% CI: 0.107, 0.380], p &lt;0.0001) (Mod2.7.3/Sec2.2.2 and Sec3.2 and Figure 2). The median PFS per IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per IRC assessment at 30 months were 81.6% (95% CI: 70.5, 88.9) in the Ibr+R arm and 27.5% (95% CI: 12.8, 44.4) in the Pbo+R arm.

The sensitivity analyses support the result in the primary analysis and the treatment effect was consistent across the all of pre-specified subgroups.

PFS data from the 1127 monotherapy substudy is well in line with the result from the randomised part. For study 1118 updated efficacy analysis are lacking, however presented data (median follow-up time of 14.8 months), the median PFS was not reached for either IRC or INV and the 18-month point estimate of the PFS rate per IRC assessment was 79.5%.

The secondary endpoints Response Rate, RR, (PR or better) per IRC and Clinical Response Rate, CRR, (MR or better) per IRC, both showed statistically convincing results. CRR, which is of clinical relevance in WM, was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm vs. 46.7% for the Pbo+R arm (rate ratio = 2.001 [95% CI: 1.554, 2.576], p &lt; 0.0001). In the 1127 open-label monotherapy substudy, the CRR was 87.1% (95% CI: 70.2, 96.4) per IRC assessment. The consistency, with results per INV, is acceptable. In Study 1118E, the CRR was 82.5% (95% CI: 70.9, 90.9) per IRC.

Furthermore;

- -The response rate (PR or better) per IRC assessment was 72.0% for the Ibr+R arm and 71.0% in the open-label monotherapy substudy. In Study 1118E, the response rate per IRC assessment was 61.9%.
- -The CRR (MR or better) per IRC assessment was 92.0% for the Ibr+R arm and 87.1% in the open-label monotherapy substudy. In Study 1118E, the CRR was 82.5% per IRC assessment.
- -Median TTnT was not reached for the Ibr+R arm or in the open-label monotherapy substudy. In Study 1118E, TTnT was not assessed.
- -Subjects with baseline Hgb ≤110 g/L had sustai ned improvement in Hgb in the Ibr+R arm (95.5% of subjects), in the Pbo+R arm (56 % of subjects) and in the open-label monotherapy study (81.0% of subjects). In Study 1118E, subjects with baseline Hgb ≤110 g/L, 81.6% of subjects had sustained improvement in Hgb during the study.

The 30-month progression free survival rates were 86% versus 33% among patients with the MYD88 L265P /CXCR4  WT  genotype, 80% versus 29% among those with the MYD88  L265P  /CXCR4 WHIM genotype, and 80% versus 21% among those with the MYD88  WT  /CXCR4  WT  genotype. For subjects with MYD88  L265P  mutation the HR was 0.191(95% CI: 0.091, 0.402) and for subjects without the MYD88  L265P

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mutation the PFS HRs was 0.214 (95% CI 0.043, 1.076). The PFS HRs were 0.337 (95% CI: 0.120, 0.948) and 0.165 (95% CI: 0.075, 0.363) for the untreated and previously treated subjects, respectively.

Tumor flare is a well-known phenomenon in WM treated with monotherapy rituximab. In the present study this was seen in 46.7% of the subjects in the Pbo+R arm vs 8% in the experimental arm. The definition of tumor flare is a 25% rise in serum Ig-M level compared to baseline. The same rise in IgM level is the definition for PD (supported by two IgM serum immunoglobulin quantitation, 4 weeks apart).  At 3 months already approximately 10% of the subjects in the Pbo+R had an event. Details concerning the instructions for the ICR review, to differentiate between IgM flair and true PD, have been presented.

In terms of the DOR, the median DOR per IRC assessment was not reached for the Ibr+R arm (range [months]: 1.87+, 36.37+) and was 21.2 months for the Pbo+R arm. In the 1127 open -label monotherapy substudy, the median DOR per IRC was not reached (range [months]: 2.43, 34.23+) or per INV (range [months]: 3.75+, 36.07+). In Study 1 118E, the median DOR was not reached per assessment by IRC (range [months]: 2.79+, 18.79+) or per INV (range [months]:0.03+, 18.79+).

Infusion reactions were recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 % (see also discussion on clinical safety).  Thus Ibrutinib sees clearly to be protective against infusion reactions caused by rituximab.

In regard to overall survival, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm. There were 4 deaths in the Ibr+R arm and 6 deaths in the Pbo+R arm.

With regard to QoL, by week 25, 68.0% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 54.7% of subjects in the Pbo+R arm had a ≥ 3 points increase from baseline in the FACIT -Fatigue subscale score: rate ratio = 1.238 (95% CI: 0.955, 1.603), p = 0.1059.

The overall compliance rates for the EQ-5D5L PRO measures had a ≥ 90% compliance rate at most time points administered. The EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale scores and utility scores were similar between the treatment arms at baseline and by Week 25, similar proportions of subjects had clinically meaningful improvements in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (45.3% Ibr+R and 46.7% Pbo+R, p = 0.8859), and utility score (34.7% Ibr+R and 32.0% Pbo+R arm, p = 0.6923).

Median time on study was 26.5 months in the randomised part, and a maturation level in the experimental arm of 18.7 % and 56 % in the control arm for the PFS analysis. For the monotherapy substudy arm the median time on study was 34 months. Date of data extraction was 12 Oct 2017. Data on PFS2 or corresponding proxy was requested and addressed in the MAH's response to the LoQ. Other concerns have been addressed in the MAH´s responses and updates of the time-dependent outcomes are expected at the time of final analysis June 2020. Please see the B/R section for discussions on the appropriateness of the comparator and discussion concerning the add-on structure of the experimental arm.

To understand the potential mechanism of resistance, genetic sequencing has been performed using bone marrow specimens of subjects in arms A, B, and C with incidence of progress disease (PD) collected at week 49, week 97, incidence of PD or suspected PD (sPD), and end of treatment (EOT). Assessment of genetic mutation profile by with the primary goal to examine the known ibrutinib resistance associated hotspot mutations in BTK (codon C481) and PLCG2 (codons R665, S707, L845) genes is planned and a comprehensive analysis using all identified somatic mutations will be performed in next phase. To date, 18 samples derived from 9 PD patients in arm C have been analysed.

During the HTA-CHAMP scientific advice 2014, the applicant was recommended to collect PFS2 data. The applicant informed that a meaningful assessment of PFS after initiation of subsequent antineoplastic treatment (PFS2) could not be made, due to a small number of events. However, the final analysis could serve as the basis of an analysis of PFS2. It is estimated that the clinical study report (CSR) for the final

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis will be available for submission by the end of June 2020.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A convincing benefit of Ibr+R over that of Pbo+R was demonstrated with respect to the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses and most of the secondary endpoints.

Together with efficacy data from study 1118, the presented data from the current study 1127, the effect of ibrutinib in WM has been further supported. Data are compelling and of clinical relevance.

The CHMP recommended the MAH that post-approval data on PFS2 or corresponding proxy be provided (expected in June 2020).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Individual safety data for ibrutinib from Study 1127 and  integrated safety data from the seven studies that presently forms the basis of the currently authorized indications for ibrutinib are presented in parallel.  The 7 studies forming the basis of the authorized indications in the ibrutinib European Union (EU) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are:

- Study PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as 1118E) for WM;
- Studies PCYC-1102-CA, PCYC-1112-CA, PCYC-1115-CA, and PCI-32765CLL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, and CLL3001) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
- Studies PCYC-1104-CA and PCI-32765MCL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1104 and MCL3001) for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

The 981 ibrutinib-treated subjects from these 7 pivotal studies are referred to as the 'Current Label Pool'.

Adverse events were coded in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 20.0. Severity of AEs was graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03.In general, the treatment-emergent period was defined as the period from the date of the first dose of study treatment (ibrutinib/placebo, rituximab) up to 30 days after the date of the last dose of study treatment or the day before initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (including crossover ibrutinib), whichever came first.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are those events that occurred or worsened during the treatment-emergent period or that were related to the study treatment.

## Open label substudy:

31 subjects with WM refractory to prior rituximab-based therapy were enrolled in the open-label monotherapy substudy (Arm C) of 1127 and received treatment with ibrutinib monotherapy. The median age was 67.0 years and more subjects were men (64.5%) and the majority of subjects were white (83.9%). The subjects had received a median of 4 (range: 1 to 7) prior WM therapies. The median time from the last prior treatment to first dose of ibrutinib was 6.1 months.

At the time of the primary analysis for Study 1127, the median time on study for subjects in the open-label monotherapy substudy was 34.4 months, and the median duration of ibrutinib monotherapy was 33.1 months. The majority of subjects (n=17, 54.8%) remained on ibrutinib monotherapy at the time of primary analysis. The most common reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib monotherapy was disease progression.

TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event

Curent Label Pool includes ibrutinib-reated subjects from Studies 1112, 1115, CLL3001, 1118E, 1104, and MCL3001, and 51 previously MCL3001, and 420 mg/day in Studies 1102,1112,1115,CLL3001, and 1118E

Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in safety population as denominator.Worst toxicity grade was used for subjects who had multiple events per system organ class or per preferred term. A subject who had event with missing toxicity grade was not listed separately Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 20.1.

Modifiedfrom:Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/AttTSFAE02AA2

The overall incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm (60%) was consistent with that for the Current Label Pool (63.0%).

## Open label sub-study:

Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in 74.2% of subjects. The most common Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥5% of subjects) were neutropenia (n=5 [16.1%]), hypertension (n=3 [9.7%]), anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia (n=2 subjects each [6.5%]).

## Treatment-emergent adverse events over time

Common TEAEs over time (i.e. ≥10% per period) in the randomised part were studied during drug exposure periods of 1 to 90 days, 91 to 180 days, 181 to 270 days and 271 to 365 days.

In the Ibr+R arm of Study 1127, the number of subjects at risk was relatively stable across the time intervals evaluated (from N=75 for Days 1-90 to N=70 for Days 271365 and N=69 for ≥Days 366), median exposure time of approximately 2 years (25.8 months). For several MedDRA SOCs and common PTs, there was no suggestion of an increase in prevalence with continued ibrutinib. However, for the following common TEAEs (i.e. reported with overall frequency of at least 10%), there was a suggestion of an increase in prevalence with continued ibrutinib treatment (i.e. difference of at least 2-fold) between Days 1-90 and Days 271-365 with consistently higher or stable rates for each subsequent time period: pneumonia (1.3% for Days 1-90; 3.4% for Days 271-365), fatigue (4.5% for Days 1-90; 10.2% for Days 271-365), pyrexia (3.0% for Days 1-90; 6.8% for Days 271-365), and hypertension (4.5% for Days 1-90; 11.9% for Days 271-365).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Arm C, Pbo+R, shows that, consistent with higher discontinuation rate and a median treatment exposure of 15.5 months reported, the number of subjects at risk declined over time (N=75 for Days 1-90, N=47 for Days 271-365 and N=42 for ≥Days 366).

Similarly, the number of subjects at risk for the Current Label Pool declined over time on ibrutinib therapy, from N=981 for Days 1-90 to N=713 for Days 271365 and N=560 for ≥Days 366), consistent with the median treatment exposure of 13 months.

The decline in the number of subjects at risk over time limits interpretation of prevalence rates across the specified intervals. In general, however, there were no apparent trends of an increase in prevalence over time for any specific common TEAEs in the Current Label Pool, with the exception of hypertension which was reported at prevalence rates of 3.4% for Days 1-90 and 7.9% for Days 271-365.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

Certain events of potential clinical relevance, included in the EU RMP, were selected based on clinical importance, frequency of occurrence, or preclinical observations. A summary of these events in study 1127 follows below.

## Hemorrhagic events

Bleeding TEAEs occurred in 50.7% (4.0% Grade 3-4) in the Ibr+R arm, whereof the most common vas ecchymosis (10.7%), Epistaxis, increased tendency to bruise, petechiae (9.3% each), contusion (8.0%), and traumatic hematoma (5.3%); all were Grade 1 or 2. Major hemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): hemoptysis, melena, and purpura (1 subject each); none were fatal.

Current label pool: Bleeding events 41.4% (3,2% grade 3-4), ecchymosis 3,4%, Epistaxis 8.3, increased tendency to bruise 4.2, petechiae 6,8. Contusion 10.5 traumatic hematoma1,5. 2 fatalities (0,3%)

In the Pbo+R arm bleeding TEAEs occurred in 21.3% of subjects whereof the most common event was epistaxis (8.0%); most were Grade 1 or 2. One hemorrhagic TEAE led to placebo discontinuation: immune thrombocytopenic purpura (1 subject) (Attachment 3-Table 14.3.1.8.1). Major hemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): epistaxis in 1 subject, hematuria in the second subject, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage intracranial (Grade 5), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura in the third subject.

Approximately 40% all subjects in the Ibr+R (41.3%) or Pbo+R (36.0%) arms in Study 1127, and 49.5% of subjects in the Current Label Pool, used  concomitant anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medication at any time during the study treatment period.

In Study 1127, pneumonia-related TEAEs was reported for 18.7% of subjects in theIbr+R arm (13.3% Grade 3 or 4). For the majority of subjects in the Ibr+R arm with a pneumonia-related TEAE, the event was serious. No reported pneumonia-related TEAE resulted in a reduction in dose or discontinuation of ibrutinib in Study 1127.

## Severe gastrointestinal disorders

In Study 1127, severe GI TEAEs (Grade 3 or 4) were reported for 2 subjects (2.7%) in the Ibr+R (one report each of Grade 3 or 4; constipation and vomiting). Neither of the Grade 3 or 4 GI TEAEs resulted in a reduction in the dose of ibrutinib or discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment The Grade 3 or 4 TEAE of constipation was serious.

Two subjects (2.7%) in the Pbo+R arm of Study 1127 had a severe GI TEAE (one report each of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and constipation). Both of these events were serious.

Non-skin cancer TEAEs were reported for 2 subjects (2.7%) in the Ibr+R arm (none in Pbo+R) arm) of Study 1127 and consisted of 1 report each of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In the Current Label Pool, non-skin cancer TEAEs occurred in 2.5% of ibrutinib-treated subjects, with most of these representing single occurrences of a particular cancer type.

## Hypertension

In the Ibr+R arm, hypertension TEAEs occurred in 18.7.0% of subjects (13.3% Grade 3 or 4). For 1 subject in this treatment arm (1.3%), the hypertension TEAE was serious (Grade 3 or 4); no subject had the dose of ibrutinib reduced or discontinued as a result of a hypertension TEAE.

In the Pbo+R arm, hypertension TEAEs occurred in 5.3% of subjects (4.0% Grade 3 or 4).

The reported incidence of hypertension TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm was higher, compared to the Current Label Pool (9.9%, with Grade 3 or 4 events 3.8%).

Few subjects in the Current Label Pool had a hypertension TEAE that was serious (0.6%; all Grade 3 or 4) or resulted in ibrutinib dose reduction (0.1%) or ibrutinib discontinuation (0.1%)

## Cardiac Arrhythmias

## · Atrial fibrillation

In Study 1127, atrial fibrillation TEAEs occurred in 11 (14.7%) subjects in the Ibr+R arm, and 2 subjects (2.7%) in the Pbo+R arm. The majority of the events were manageable without treatment discontinuation and 8 of the 14 events were reported as resolved. Three of the 11 subjects in the Ibr+R arm with atrial fibrillation discontinued the study drug and led to a reduction of the ibrutinib dose. In 1 subject in the Pbo+R arm the event was serious, and Grade 3 or 4 in severity.

## Deaths

In the Ibr+R arm, no fatal TEAEs occurred. There were 3 Grade 5 TEAE (death), all in the Pbo+R arm in the randomised part of the study (unknown cause, hemorrhage intracranial, and nervous system disorder).

## Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation

TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation in the Ibr+R arm were reported for 4 subjects (5.3%): atrial fibrillation (3 subjects), interstitial lung disease, and rash macular (1 subject each).

Rituximab discontinuation was reported for 2 subjects (atrial defibrillation and variant angina, 1 subject each).

In the Pbo+R arm, TEAEs leading to placebo discontinuation were reported for 5 subjects, 6.7% (asthenia, 2 subjects and Brugada syndrome, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and night sweats, 1 subject each).

TEAEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were reported for 9 subjects, 12.0% (infusion related reaction,7 subjects and asthenia and Brugada syndrome (1 subject each).

No subjects had TEAE of tumor lysis syndrome or leucostasis, in either arm. Neither was any TLS or leucostasis seen in the monotherapy substudy.

## Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction

Ibrutinib dose reduction was reported for 14 subjects (18.7%) in the Ibr+R arm. Events leading to dose reduction for two or more subjects were neutropenia (n=3) and atrial fibrillation (n=2) and muscle spasm (n=2). There were no dose reductions of placebo in the Pbo+R arm.

## Open label sub-study:

Serious TEAEs were reported in 35.5% of subjects; no individual serious TEAE preferred term was reported in more than 1 subject each.

In the open-label monotherapy substudy, no subject had a major hemorrhagic TEAE, or TEAEs of TLS, leukostasis syndrome, atrial fibrillation, ILD, or SCAR. One subject (3.2%) had a NMSC TEAE (squamous cell carcinoma), and 1 subject had a non-skin cancer TEAE (renal cell carcinoma).

No fatal TEAEs occurred during the monotherapy ibrutinib treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypertension TEAEs were reported in 8 (25.8%) subjects and cardiac arrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation) were reported in 4 subjects. There were no cases of atrial fibrillation.

Infection TEAEs were reported in 22 (71.0%) subjects; for 6 (19.4%) subjects, the infection TEAE was Grade 3 or 4 in severity. One subject had an Aspergillus infection (Grade 3 or 4).

TEAEs were the reported as the primary reason for ibrutinib discontinuation for 2 subjects (6.5%) and consisted of constipation and diarrhea (reported as reason for discontinuation in 1 subject each).Till discontinuation.

## Laboratory findings

In the Ibr+R arm, TEAE Grade 3 or 4 decreases in ANC occurred in 9.3% of subjects, and Grade 3 or 4 decreases in Hgb and platelets occurred in 1.3% of subjects each. In the Pbo+R arm, TEAE Grade 3 or 4 decreases in ANC occurred in 6.7% of subjects, and Grade 3 or 4 decreases in Hgb and platelets occurred in 10.7% and 5.3% of subjects, respectively.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety evaluation rests on a total of 981 patients that constitutes the integrated dataset (= current label pool) which includes the 63 WM patients from the pivotal 1118E study. The present variation for extended indication in WM adds further 150 patients to the safety evaluation. A total of 213 patients, given the rarity of WM, are considered acceptable.

Apart from the 1127 study, the integrated dataset consists of study 1118E in WM (WM, n=63) of studies 1102 (CLL/SLL, n=51), 1112 (CLL/SLL, n=195), 1115 (CLL/SLL, n=135) and CLL3001 (CLL/SLL, and n=287). Studies MCL3001 (MCL, n=139) and 1104 (MCL, n=111).This is referred to as the Current Label Pool.

The safety population was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of ibrutinib and it should be noted that the posology differs between indications i.e. MCL (560 mg/daily) versus CLL/SLL and WM (both 420 mg/daily). In addition to the current label pool, safety data from, a presently assessed parallel

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

procedure, Study 1130 (CLL/SLL) is incorporated, now comprising 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib for CLL, WM, or MCL, constitutes the Overall Label Pool.

The median duration of exposure to ibrutinib in the 1127 study was 26 months (median average dos of 411 mg/day) compared to 13 months in the current label pool (median average dos of 416 mg/day). The study also includes time-truncated data.

All patients in the 1127 study had at least one TEAE. In the Ibr+R arm a high incidence reported for various SOCs (e.g. gastrointestinal disorder; 59%, infections/infestations; 69%, general disorder; 56%, blood and lymphatic system disorder; 45%, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder; 52%, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal system disorder; 39%, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder; 53%, nervous system disorders; 40%).  About 60 % of the patients in the 1127 study reported any Grade 3 or 4 event (both arms).

Frequency of infusion related reactions to rituximab were observed in a considerably lower rate in the Ibr+R arm versus the Pbo+R arm.

In the 1127 study, there were 3 Grade 5 TEAE (death), all in the Pbo+R arm in the randomised part of the study (1 unknown cause, 1 hemorrhage intracranial, and 1 nervous system disorder).

The safety profile of the 1127 study was largely consistent with the current label pool, with the exception of hypertension (13 % vs 3 % in the Ibr+R arm and current label pool, respectively) and atrial fibrillation (12% vs 3 %, Ibr+R arm and current label pool, respectively). The time-truncated data showed an increased prevalence of hypertension, by time of exposure to ibrutinib. This however, was not the case for atrial fibrillation. An increased frequency was also seen for arthralgia which occurred in a more than doubled rate in Ibr+R arm compared to both the Pbo+R arm and the current label pool (24% vs 11% and 12%) and was not reported to be time dependent.

In the Ibr+R arm, no fatal TEAEs occurred, however, but in the Pbo+R arm, fatal TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): death (unknown cause), intracranial haemorrhage, and nervous system disorder. The reported figure from the current label pool was 7 %. In all there were 10 deaths reported (4 vs 6 Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively.

TEAEs lead to discontinuation of study drug in 5.3 % and 6.7 % in the Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to rituximab discontinuation were reported for 2 subjects in the Ibr+R arm. The rate of discontinuation of study drug in the current label pool was 11.4 %. Dose reduction was seen in 18.7 % in the Ibr+R arm (mainly neutropenia, atrial fibrillation and muscle spasms). In the current label pool fewer subjects had a dose reduction, 11.4%.  No subjects in Pbo+R arm had any dose reduction due to TEAE.

TEAE grade ≥ 3 occurred in 60 % vs 61 % in the Ibr +R arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively and 70 % in the current label pool. The most common TEAEs grade ≥ 3 were infections and blood and lymphatic disorder. Any serious TEAE grade &gt; 3 occurred in 38.7 % and 29.3%, in the Ibr+R arm and the Pbo+R arm, respectively, while this was seen in 42% in the current label pool. One of the TEAEs of clinical interest concerns bleeding; in the Ibr+R arm, TEAEs occurred in 50.7%, the most common events ( ≥ 5 % of subjects) were ecchymosis (10.7%), epistaxis, increased tendency to bruise, petechiae (9.3% each). Major haemorrhagic TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (4.0%): hemoptysis, melena, and purpura (1 subject each); none were fatal. The proportion of subjects with a haemorrhage TEAE of any grade/severity or with a major haemorrhagic TEAE in the Ibr+R arm of Study 1127 were consistent with those observed in the Current Label Pool. Bleeding TEAEs in the Pbo+R arm occurred in 21.3% of subjects; the most common event ( ≥ 5% of subjects) were epistaxis (8.0%); most were Grade 1 or 2.

Infusion reactions was recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 %.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Infections were among the most common events in the Ibr+R arm, reported in 69.3% of subjects (22.7% Grade 3 or 4). In Study 1127, there were no events of Aspergillus infections in the Ibr+R arm, there was a single case of Aspergillus infection in the open-label substudy of ibrutinib monotherapy.

Infection-related TEAEs were reported at a lower rate in the Pbo+R arm (41.3% any grade; 8.0% Grade 3-4; 5.3% serious) than in the Ibr+R arm in Study 1127. In the current label pool, frequencies observed for ibrutinib-treated subjects of infection TEAEs of any grade, Grade 3 or 4, or serious events, was consistent with Ibr+R arm of Study 1127.

The incidence of severe GI TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm was lower than that for the Current Label Pool (8.7% Grade 3 or 4; 0.2% Grade 5) but resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation for only a small minority (n=7, 0.7%). Diarrhea (3.2%) and abdominal pain (2.0%) were the most frequent severe (and serious) GI TEAEs in the Current Label Pool.

The increased prevalence in hypertension observed in Ibr+R might be a consequence from longer time on treatment. However, there was no increase in prevalence over time observed for atrial fibrillation. There was a doubled rate of TEAE atrial fibrillation in the Ibr+R arm (any grade 14.7%, Grade 3 or higher: 13.3%) compared to the current label pool (any grade 6.4%, Gr 3 or higher: 3.4%).

Atrial fibrillation TEAEs in the Current Label Pool generally did not result in dose reduction or discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment (0.1% and 0.7% subjects respectively) and were not serious for the majority of subjects (3.1% of subjects had serious atrial fibrillation).

Similar frequencies of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs (excluding atrial fibrillation) was reported in both arms of study 1127 (Ibr+R arm: 10.7% and Pbo+R 9.3%). The pattern of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm was consistent with that observed for ibrutinib-treated subjects in the Current Label Pool. In the Current Label Pool, the frequency of cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs (excluding atrial fibrillation) of any grade was 10.1%.

One subject experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE in the Ibr+R arm (Grade 1 ventricular extra systoles), this did not result in ibrutinib dose reduction or discontinuation. Two subjects (2.7%) in the Pbo+R arm of Study 1127 had a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE. The occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAEs in subjects in the Ibr+R in Study 1127 was consistent with the pattern of these events in the Current Label Pool, where 1.0% of subjects had a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE, most of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.

No change in Other Malignancy frequency or pattern is seen, due to low and constant frequency, in 1127 compared to the current label pool. Treatment-emergent AEs of tumor flare were excluded from the other malignancy summaries, as these events were assessed separately. Tumor flare, associated with the usage of rituximab in WM, and which in WM only counts for a temporary, treatment evoked, increase serum IgM level, was decreased in the Ibr+R arm compared to the Pbo+R arm: 8.0% vs. 46.7%, respectively.

Of the 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib for CLL, WM, or MCL comprising the Overall Label Pool, 5.1% discontinued treatment primarily due to ADRs. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse drug reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 6.6% of the 1,200 subjects.

Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved SmPC.  Warnings regarding hypertension have been included in section 4.4 to recommend regular monitoring of blood pressure in patients treated with Imbruvica and initiation or adjustment of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antihypertensive medication throughout treatment as appropriate.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with WM is overall consistent with what is already known in ibrutinib treated patients with CLL/SLL and MCL. No new safety signal has been seen. A higher frequency of hypertension was noted and also seen to increase in a time-on treatment-dependent way. The SmPC has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4,4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to hypertension has been added to the product information.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The indication is for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) in combination with rituximab.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In the EU, only a minority of patients are offered monotherapy rituximab for the treatment of WM according to a recent large retrospective chart review (Lancet Haematol 2018, C Buske et al). Data from Medicare claims linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, which evaluated changes in the presentation, management, and survival among 2,666 Medicare beneficiaries, diagnosed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with WM between 1994 and 2011 in the US - show that rituximab monotherapy was prescribed for &gt;50% of patients since 2004, and combination CIT for a further 30%. Based on input from the WM Consortium Group and a Joint CHMP-HTA Scientific Advice in 2014 regarding the design of Study 1127, the importance of a treatment of WM to move toward to a chemotherapy-free regimen, to control the disease and improve quality of life, is underlined.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Study 1127 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab versus rituximab alone in subjects 18 years of age or older with untreated or previously treated WM. In addition, an open-label substudy (Treatment Arm C) was included to further investigate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib as a monotherapy in adult subjects with WM who were considered refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy.

A total of 150 subjects were included in the randomised part (75 patients in each arm) and 31 subjects were included in the monotherapy sub-study. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the experimental arm, Ibr+R, compared to placebo Pbo+R, in subjects with WM. The study design was developed considering the scientific advice from regulatory agencies, including CHMP in 2014.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The study met its primary endpoint with an improvement of median PFS (IRC assessed). Median PFS was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and was 20.3 months for the Pbo+R arm (HR = 0.202 (95% CI: 0.107, 0.380), p &lt; 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate at 30 months were 82 % for the Ibr+R arm and 28 % for the Pbo+R arm.

The sensitivity analyses performed on PFS supports the result in the primary analysis and the treatment effect was consistent across the pre-specified subgroups. The benefit in the Ibr+R group over that in the Pbo+R group was independent of the MYD88 or CXCR4 genotype. The secondary endpoint, RR (≥ PR) per IRC assessment was significantly higher for the Ibr+R arm than the Pbo+R arm: 72.0% Ibr+R vs. 32.0% Pbo+R, rate ratio = 2.299 (95% CI: 1.592; 3.319), p &lt; 0.0001. In terms of TTnT, median TTnT showed a statistically significant advantage for the Ibr+R arm; it was not reached for the Ibr+R arm and it was 18.1 months (95% CI: 11.1, NE) for the Pbo+R arm, HR = 0.096 (95% CI: 0.040, 0.227), p &lt; 0.0001. At the 30-month landmark time point an estimated 91.5% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 41.4% of subjects in the Pbo+R arm had not received subsequent treatment.  Any subsequent antineoplastic therapy was received by 6 subjects (8.0%) in the Ibr+R arm and 41 subjects (54.7%) in the Pbo+R arm, of which 30 subjects received ibrutinib as crossover therapy. The median OS was not reached for either treatment arm. There were 4 deaths in the Ibr+R arm and 6 deaths in the Pbo+R arm. In terms of HQoL/ EQ-5D5L PRO results compliance was high (≥ 90%) and showed similar results for patients in both arms for whom data was available.

Study 1127 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with Ibr+R treatment compared with Pbo+R when evaluating sustained Hgb improvement for subjects with untreated or previously treated WM. A substantial improvement of Hgb was also seen in the monotherapy substudy arm. In study 1118E the Hgb improvement was lower than seen in the single arm substudy of 1127.

In terms of clinical response rate (≥ MR), the rate was comparable between the two monotherapy arms (substudy 1127 and 1118E) and Ibr+R, 87 %, 83 % and 92 % respectively.

Infusion reactions was recorded for a substantially fewer subjects in the Ibr+R arm compared to the Pbo+R arm, 1.3 % versus 16 %. Thus Ibrutinib sees clearly to be protective against infusion reactions

caused by rituximab.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

It was also clarified that the time point for data cut-off was the same as the extraction of data, i.e. 12 Oct 2017. The maturation of PFS data presently presented is, in the Pbo+R arm 56 % versus 18.7 % in the Ibr+R. Updated efficacy results and PFS2 data will, according to the applicant, be presented at the time of the final analysis of study 1127, which is planned to take place by the end of June 2020. At this time, it will be possible to evaluate possible impaired effect on response to CIT (next line of therapy) upon progression on ibrutinib treatment.

The role of rituximab is unclear in the combination arm, since the isolation of ibrutinib and the potential effect of adding rituximab is impossible to disentangle in the presented data. Cross study comparisons with previous monotherapy study 1118E and the ibrutinib monotherapy substudy in the present study 1127, are not indicative of additive effect. However, rituximab it is a well-recognized treatment option due to its established monotherapy activity as well as a synergistic effect when combined with chemotherapy. Therefor the add-on strategy is deemed acceptable, from a regulatory perspective.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

Overall tolerability of ibrutinib given in combination with rituximab is consistent with its known safety profile. Safety data from study 1127 is also put in the context of the Current label pool for ibrutinib, consisting of 981 subjects (both monotherapy and various combination treatment data).

In summary, the most common adverse events of any grade with ibrutinib-rituximab included infusionrelated reactions, diarrhea, arthralgia, and nausea. Events of grade ≥ 3 that occurred more frequently with ibrutinib-rituximab than with placebo-rituximab included atrial fibrillation (12% vs. 1%) and hypertension (13% vs. 4%); those that occurred less frequently included infusion reactions (1% vs. 16%) and any grade of IgM flare (8% vs. 47%). The major hemorrhage rate was the same in the two trial groups (4%). Hypertension was observed to increase in prevalence with time on continued ibrutinib treatment, which is reflected in the PI ; hypertension is an important identified risk of ibrutinib and the RMP was updated accordingly.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

There were no uncertainties in the assessment of safety.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Based on the findings in a Phase 2 study in WM, 1118E, ibrutinib monotherapy has shown clinically relevant benefit in WM subjects who had failed prior CD20 therapy (either alone or in combination with other agents). This supported a second line indication in WM, also including those patients being unfit for CIT as first line therapy. The results from the randomized part of, Study 1127 with a median time on study of 26.5 months (both arms) demonstrate that treatment with combination of Ibr+R results in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement of PFS, response rates, DOR and sustained Hgb improvements compared with Pbo+R treatment. This was shown in subjects that were both treatment-naïve and previously treated WM.

The results also demonstrate a significantly longer time to next line of WM therapy (TTnT) as well as lower rates of infusion reactions in the Ibr+R-treated subjects compared with Pbo+R-treated subjects. The treatment effect of Ibr+R on PFS was robust and consistent across all predefined subgroups.

For the 1127 open-label monotherapy substudy (Treatment Arm C), enrolling only subjects considered refractory to the last prior rituximab-containing therapy, the efficacy results (after a median time on study of 34.4 months) for PFS, response rates and sustained Hgb improvements, further confirm the efficacy of single agent ibrutinib, as previously observed in Study 1118E, for the treatment of WM.

No new safety signals were observed; the majority of the TEAE rates are essentially consistent with the known safety profile in the current label pool. In summary, the safety profile for ibrutinib is in large consistent with its known safety profile. The risks known to be associated with the use of ibrutinib (e.g. hemorrhage, neutropenia, infections, arthralgia) are manageable through medical management with routine clinical assessment. This also accounts for the known TEAEs like atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Data from the primary analysis from the study 1127 in WM, showed superiority on PFS of the combination of Ibr+R over Pbo+R, in treatment-naïve and previously treated patients WM. Furthermore, the results from the ibrutinib monotherapy substudy in rituximab-refractory patients indicate a treatment effect comparable to the results in the ibrutinib-containing arm in the randomised study. Furthermore, Study 1127 investigated the 'add on' of ibrutinib or placebo to rituximab in a population with both treatment-naïve patients and previously treated patients.

The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib + rituximab vs ibrutinib monotherapy in the broad indication WM.

In order to better understand the ibrutinib resistance, there is need of PFS2 data or a corresponding proxy such as time to second subsequent therapy. The MAH will provide final results in June 2020 were also PFS2 data will be presented (see RMP).

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Imbruvica in the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) in combination with rituximab is positive.
