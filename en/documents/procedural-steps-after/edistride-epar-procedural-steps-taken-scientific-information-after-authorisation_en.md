No dosage adjustment is required based on renal function. Xigduo, Ebymect: the maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis should be reviewed before considering initiation of metformin in patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.

All treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. The combination treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged release exenatide group showed superior reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared to dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release exenatide alone. Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged release exenatide resulted in significantly greater reductions in fasting plasma glucose, in 2 hour post prandial glucose, in body weight and systolic blood pressure at week 28, as compared to either agent alone. These efficacy results were reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In addition the statement that combination with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) analogues had not been studied, was removed from section 4.4 as result of the availability of this study. |

| A20/0010 | Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the European Commission requested on 15 April 2016 the PRAC to assess the impact on the benefit-risk balance of canagliflozin containing medicinal products of an increase in amputations, mostly affecting the toes, observed in an ongoing clinical trial (CANVAS) for canagliflozin and a numerical imbalance with regards to amputation events seen in an ongoing renal study CANVAS-R with a similar population as CANVAS. Considering that a class effect cannot be excluded, the European Commission extended on 6 July 2016 the scope of the procedure to include all SGLT2 inhibitors containing medicinal products to allow a review of data from the class. The PRAC was requested to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Invokana, Vokanamet, Forxiga, Edistride, Xigduo, Ebymect, Jardiance and Synjardy and to give its recommendation whether the marketing authorisation of these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. As the request results from the evaluation of data resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the CHMP opinion has been be adopted on the basis of a recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee. | 09/02/2017 | 20/04/2017 | SmPC and PL | Please refer to the assessment report: SGLT2 inhibitors - EMEA/H/A-20/1442 |
