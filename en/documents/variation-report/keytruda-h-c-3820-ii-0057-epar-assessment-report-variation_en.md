## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) and blocks the interaction between the PD-1 pathway receptor and its ligands,  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  1  (PD-L1)  and  programmed  cell  death  1  ligand  2  (PD-L2) expressed  on  antigen  presenting  tumour  cells.  Binding  of  either  PD-1  ligand  to  PD-1  inhibits  T  cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor, thus overcoming the active anti-tumour specific T cell immune surveillance. The high expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various cancers and suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumour evasion and is thus an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.

In the setting of lung cancer, which currently represents the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide  accounting  for  1.76  million  of  deaths  globally  (Globocan  2018),  pembrolizumab-based immunotherapy is a consolidated therapeutic option in clinical practice. Current guidelines recommend the  use  of  Keytruda  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  i.e.  the prevailing histological subtype ( 85% -90%) of all lung malignancies, as follows (ESMO, 2019):

- -First-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression [Tumou r Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%] with no EGFR or ALK positive tumo ur aberrations
- -Advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours express PDL1 (TPS ≥1%) and who have received prior platinum-based therapy, and if the tumours express EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on approved therapy before receiving Keytruda

Moreover, Keytruda has been recently approved in combination with chemotherapy as first line treatment in metastatic NSCLC irrespective of the PD-L1 level of expression. The chemotherapy regimen associated with pembrolizumab depends on the histology: pemetrexed and a platinum compound in non-squamous NSCLC with negative ALK/EGFR disease (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0043) or carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel in squamous NSCLC (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0060).

Chemotherapy regimens used in NSCLC include cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or docetaxel (ESMO, 2019). Multiple Phase 3 studies have demonstrated similar efficacy for most platinum-based chemotherapy in the 1 st  line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC (Schiller JH. et al, 2002) ; response rates have ranged from 15% t o 33%, with median PFS of approximately 4.5 to 6.3 months, and median OS of 10.3 to 12.1 months [Socinski et al. 2012, Sandler et al 2006, Scagliotti et al 2008, Thatcher et al 2015] . Treatment-related mortality (deaths due to AEs) in these studies has ran ged from 0% to 3%. However, the overall 5 -year survival rate of 9%  to  13%. Over  the  past  4  years,  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  such  as  PD-1/PD-L1  blocking antibodies, have emerged as effective alternatives to chemotherapy for many tumour types. In 1L and 2L+ NSCLC, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy or in combination depending on the setting.

With  this  submission,  the  MAH  intends  to  further  extend  the  clinical  indication  of  Keytruda  as monotherapy in  the  NSCLC  setting  to  include  previously  untreated  patients  with  metastatic  disease (including both squamous and non-squamous subtypes) not expressing EGFR or ALK tumour aberrations,

in the presence of a PDL1 positive score with TPS ≥ 1%.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from conducting Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients are not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The only new clinical study that has been submitted in support of this application is study KEYNOTE042.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

A description of the clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC was included in the KEYNOTE-024 submission to support 200 mg Q3W as the recommended dosing regimen of pembrolizumab in this patient population (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0011, 27 January 2017). No new clinical pharmacology analyses beyond those provided in previous submissions have been generated.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

This submission is based on the second interim analysis (IA2; date cut-off: 26-FEB-2018) of the Phase 3 trial KEYNOTE-042, a multicentre, international, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical study of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy in previously untreated adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. During the procedure, final analysis results of the study were also submitted (FA; date cut-off: 4-SEP-2018); a subsequent updated OS analysis with database date cut-off of 25-OCT-2019 was also presented.

The MAH also included supporting data from the final planned analysis of OS (data cut-off: 10-JUL-2017) and  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  ORR,  and  DOR  (IA2,  data  cut-off:  09-MAY-2016)  of  the  phase  3  trial KEYNOTE-024, i.e. the pivotal study for pembrolizumab in treatment-naïve metastatic NSCLC patients negative  for  ALK/EGFR  tumour  aberrations  and  highly  expressing  PDL1  (TPS≥50%).  Detailed information on the main pivotal study (KEYNOTE-042) are summarised in the following table:

## Sample size

The study randomized subjects in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab arm and the SOC arm. The sample size for the subjects with TPS ≥ 50% was targeted at approximately 530 and drove the end of enrolment, the overall sample size for this study was projected to be approximately 1240. The final analysis of the study was planned to occur about 45 months after the first subject randomized (study start), at which time approximately 398 deaths (projections updated in November 2017) were expected between the two arms in the subjects with TPS ≥ 50%. With 398 deaths, the study ha d approximately 99% power to detect a 0.65 piecewise hazard ratio on OS at alpha=2.5% (one -sided) in the subjects with TPS ≥ 50%. By the same time, the expected numbers of deaths were about 557 and 900 in the subjects with TPS ≥ 20% and TPS ≥ 1%, respectively. With 557 deaths, the study had approximately 98% power to detect a piecewise hazard ratio on OS with 0.8 before month 6 and 0.64 after month 6 at alpha=2.5% (one -

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sided) in the subjects with TPS ≥ 20%. With 900 deaths, the study had approximatel y 91% power to detect a piecewise hazard ratio with 0.92 by month 6 and 0.73 after month 6 at alpha=2.5% (one -sided) in the subjects with TPS ≥ 1%.

The assumed hazard ratios were based on results from studies KN010 and KN024. The above calculations were based on the following assumptions: 1) OS in the standard of care arm follows an exponential distribution with a median of 13 months, 2) hazard ratio on OS between pembrolizumab and control is 0.65 in the subjects with TPS ≥ 50%, 3) an enrolment period of ~26 months and a minimal 19-month follow-up period after enrolment completion, 4) a dropout rate of 0.003 per month for OS.

## Randomisation

Randomization was centralized using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). There were 2 treatment arms. Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to pembrolizumab and SOC, respectively.

Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors:

- 1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale (0 vs. 1)
- 2) Histology (squamous vs. non-squamous)
- 3) Geographic region of the enrolling site (East Asia vs. non-East Asia)
- 4) PD-L1 expression status (TPS ≥ 50% vs. TPS 1 -49%) prior to randomization.

## Blinding (masking)

This  was  an  open-label  study.  Imaging  data  for  the  primary  analysis  were  centrally  reviewed  by independent radiologists without knowledge of subject treatment assignment. The subject level PD-L1 biomarker (TPS) results were masked in the database to the study team at the Sponsor including clinical, statistical,  statistical  programming,  and  data  management personnel. Access to the TPS results was limited to an unblinded Sponsor clinical scientist and an unblinded data management analyst who were responsible for data review to ensure validity of results but who had no other responsibilities associated with  the  study.  Even  though  the  Sponsor  was  unblinded  to  individual  treatment  assignments,  the Sponsor did not conduct any analysis upon aggregate data until the required number of events were reached and did not become aware of such results until the external DMC advised the Executive Oversight Committee that the endpoint of OS had been achieved.

## Statistical methods

Efficacy analyses were conducted in the TPS ≥ 50%, ≥ 20%, and ≥ 1% sub -populations using the intentionto-treat (ITT) population.

All safety analyses were conducted using data from the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population, i.e., all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment.

The treatment difference in OS (primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., the HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the  survival  curves.  The  hypotheses  for  PFS  were  evaluated  using  the  same  methods  used  for  OS assessment. The hypotheses for ORR were evaluated using a stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with weights proportional to the stratum size. Stratification factors were the same used for randomization (ECOG performance scale, histology, geographic region of the enrolling site, and PD-L1 expression).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  an  exploratory  analysis,  recognized  methods,  e.g.,  the  Rank  Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time (RPSFT) model, two-stage method, etc., were to be used to adjust for the effect of crossover on OS based upon the appropriateness of the data to the assumption required by the methods.

To further account for the possible confounding effect, a sensitivity analysis of OS that censors subjects at the time of initiation of new therapy was planned and an OS analysis that treats initiation of new therapy as a time-dependent binary covariate was also to be conducted. In case the proportional hazards assumption did not hold, Fleming and Harrington's weighted log-rank test, Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method or other methods, as appropriate, were planned, possibly after proper adjustment of the crossover effect over time.

In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint, two sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules were planned (Table below).

## Subgroup analyses

The estimate of the treatment effect was provided for the following subgroups:

age ( ≤ 65 vs. &gt;65 years); sex (female vs. male); race (white vs. non-white); ECOG status (0 vs. 1); geographic region of enrolling site  (East  Asia  vs.    non-East  Asia  and  East  Asia  vs.  Europe  vs.  Latin America vs. Other); histology (squamous vs. non-squamous); smoking status (never vs. former vs. current); PD-L1 status (TPS ≥ 50% vs. TPS 1 -49%, TPS ≥ 20% vs. TPS 1 -19%, and TPS ≥ 50% vs. TPS 2049% vs. TPS 1 -19%); Investigators'  choice  of  SOC  chemotherap y prior  to  randomization (Pemetrexed vs. No Pemetrexed); disease stage (advanced vs. metastatic); brain metastasis status (yes vs. no); baseline tumour size (at/above median vs. below median).

## Interim analyses

2Study start isdefined as thedatewhen thefirst subjectwasrandomized.

Nominal alpha and boundaries will be re-calculated if the actual number of events at analyses is altered from the expected.In this hypothetical scenario, the numbers of death at IA2 and final are assumed to be the same as the projected, i.e., 340 and 398 in the subjects with TPS&gt;50%, 474 and 557 in the subjects with TPS&gt;20%, and 780 and 900 in the subjects with TPS≥1%. The actual boundaries will need to be recalculated based on the observed number of deaths.

## Multiplicity strategy

The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  hypotheses  were  analysed  using  a  sequential  testing  strategy, testing a hypothesis only if superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was established for all the preceding hypotheses. The order of testing was as follows: OS in subjects with TPS ≥ 50%, TPS ≥ 20%, and TPS ≥ 1%; PFS in TPS ≥ 50%, TPS ≥ 20%, and TPS ≥ 1%; and ORR in TPS ≥ 50%, TPS ≥ 20%, and TPS ≥ 1%. The alpha spending at IA2 and FA was determined by the Hwang-Shih-DeCani alpha spending function with the gamma parameter -0.9023.

## Change in the planned analysis and study design

During the conduct of KEYNOTE-042 and prior to any analysis being performed, the study protocol was amended several times. The major changes are summarized below:

In the original protocol (18 Jun 2014), the hypothesis was formulated on the basis of the supposed OS in strongly positive patients (TPS ≥50%); analyses were event -driven (final analysis at 354 OS events, supposed HR=0.70) and three interim analyses were contemplated (IA1 at 75 OS events observed in the weakly positive PD-L1 stratum; IA2 at 315 PFS events and IA3 at 283 OS events in TPS ≥ 50%); the type  I  error  rate  was  split  between  OS  (2%,  one -sided)  a nd PFS (0.5%, that was a key secondary endpoint).

With Amendment 02 (21 Dec 2015), the hypothesis also inclu ded TPS≥1%; changes in the target number of events were introduced (from the initial 354 OS events to 340 for the FA in TPS≥50%); the number of IA were reduced from 3 to 2 (IA1 at 187 OS events and IA2 at 272 OS events); the type I error was totally spent for OS (2.5%).

In Amendment 03 (12 Apr 2017) an intermediate cutoff value of TPS≥20% was introduced; a single IA was planned at 250 OS events and with a conserved totality of OS events of 340 for FA, the HR was changed from 0.70 to 0.65.

Finally, Amendment 06 (09 Jan 2018), that followed the conduction of IA1 (30 Aug 2017), re-introduced IA2 with an updated FA based on calendar time at 45 months and an additional IA based on calendar time at 38 months in order to maintain a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months. Timing and control of multiplicity were changed accordingly. Under the revised alpha allocation, the alpha spending was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

determined by the Hwang-Shih-DeCani with the gamma parameter -0.9023 instead of the initially set value -5.  With this spending, the alpha level at IA1 was the same as the actual spent at IA1 (one-sided 1.576%) based on the scale of calendar time fraction 0.729 (i.e., 986/1353). The cumulative alpha (one -sided) spending at the planned time of IA2 and FA became 1.94% and 2.5%, rega rdless of the actual number of deaths observed at the IA2 and FA.

## Results

## Participant flow

Main reasons for screen failure were the following (note that a subject may have had more than one trial entry criteria resulting in screen failure):

- tumour samples PD-L1 negative: n=1062
- No histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic NSCLC and had an EGFR sensitizing

mutation or ALK translocation: n=291

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Had an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK translocation: n=272
- Tumour specimen not evaluable for PD-L1 expression: n=165
- ECOG score &gt;1: n=161

Each subject is counted once for Study Medication Disposition.

Status not Recorded for subjects that are continuing in trial or trial segment.

Database Cutoff Date: 04SEP2018

Disposition for subjects with TPS ≥ 50% and ≥ 20% NSCLC was similar to that observed for the entire study population (TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC) .

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 196 centres in 32 countries across Europe (22.4%), Latin America (21.1%), East Asia (29.0%) and other (27.5%). Randomization started on 19 Dec 2014 and was completed on 27 Feb 2017.

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments

There  were  7  protocol  amendments;  of  them,  4  were  country-specific  (amendment  01  for  Sweden, amendments 04, 05 and 07 were related to the China Extension Study). A summary of the relevant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changes to KEYNOTE-042 protocol, including updates to the statistical analysis plan (SAP), are outlined below:

Amendment-02 : An amendment to modify the SAP based on new efficacy data from KEYNOTE-010. As a consequence, the futility analysis for the PD-L1 149% subgroup was removed from KEYNOTE -042. The primary objective was updated to include the primary endpoint for OS in the overall TPS ≥ 1% population in addition to the PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% subgroup. The full alpha was allocated to OS, instead of splitting it between OS and PFS.

Amendment-03 : An amendment to update the SAP based on KEYNOTE-010 results (2L+ treatment), evaluating  efficacy  at  different  PD-L1  cutpoints,  and  new  data  from  KEYNOTE-024  (1L  treatment), showing a very strong overall survival signal. As a result, the KEYNOTE-042 SAP changed the OS primary endpoint to a sequential stepdown from TPS ≥ 50% to a new intermediate cutpoint of TPS ≥ 20%, to TPS ≥ 1%. Based on the updated projected timing of events and power calculations for IA1 and IA2, the number of planned interim analyses was reduced to one. The exponential spending function was changed to O'Brien-Fleming as requested by the FDA.

Amendment-06 : An amendment to update the SAP. The rate of event accrual was faster than originally anticipated and the FA was expected to occur in February 2018 when the elapsed time would only be about 38 months. In order to preserve the data maturity at the FA, a new IA was added for February 2018 and a new FA that preserved the originally anticipated 45 months of follow-up. These changes required a revised alpha spending allocation that was retrospectively consistent with the alpha spent at IA1. Given the alpha spend of 1.576% (one -sided) at IA1, the new cumulative alpha spending follows the Hwang-Shih-Decani spending function with the gamma parameter -0.9023, so that the alpha actually spent at the IA1 will be kept intact. The power calculations were updated based on the revised alpha allocation and analysis timing.

## Protocol deviations

| Subject received 3 simultaneous chemotherapeutic agents (carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pemetrexed) | 1                    |

In  addition,  important  administrative  protocol  deviations  were  noted  for  66  subjects  without  SAE reporting within 24 hours of learning of the event, 9 subjects with a delay in signing the initial consent, and 113 subjects that did not sign the updated safety consent following a significant safety change to the  risk  language  prior  to  performing  study  procedures  and/or  the  next  cycle  of  treatment.  At  a subsequent visit, all subjects signed the initial consent or safety consent except for 8 subjects that either died or withdrew from the study. According to the MAH, no subject's safety was endangered due to the delay in reporting SAEs or to the delay in signing the informed consent. No subjects were excluded from the efficacy analyses.

At the updated database lock (01-OCT-2018), there were 4 additional patients with important protocol deviations compared to the prior cut-off date (2 patients: Inclusion #9-EGFR sensitizing mutation; 1 patient:  treatment  discontinuation  requirement  not  followed;  1  patient  administration  of  prohibited medication (Tarceva) during the study).

Demographics for subjects with TPS ≥ 50% and ≥ 20% NSCLC were similar to those of the entire population (TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC) , with no meaningful imbalances between treatment arms.

## Chemotherapy by histology

The majority of the 375/388 subjects with non-squamous NSCLC that actually started treatment received pemetrexed + carboplatin, while all subjects with squamous NSCLC received paclitaxel + carboplatin. Of these 375 subjects, 196 (52.3%) received pemetrexed maintenance following induction chemotherapy. Of the 179 subjects with nonsquamous NSCLC who did not receive pemetrexed maintenance, 50.3% experie nced PD/clinical progression prior to the maintenance phase, 19.0% discontinued treatment due to AEs prior to the maintenance phase, and 23.5% did not receive pemetrexed maintenance because maintenance was not planned/specified at the time of randomization.

Database Cutoff Date: 25OCT2019

The hypotheses for OS across all 3 TPS cut-points (TPS ≥ 50%, ≥ 20%, and ≥ 1% ) were met at the previous IA2.

As of the data cut-off date of the FA, the median duration of follow-up was 14.0 months (range: 0.143.7 months) in the ITT population. In the most up-to-date OS analysis, additional 14 months of follow-up were included with extension of the median follow-up period in the ITT population up to 43 months (range: 32-58 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The OS rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group at 18 months (48.3% vs 37.4%, respectively).

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

## Progression Free Survival

TPS ≥ 50% NSCLC

PFS was not significantly improved with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (tested at the pvalue boundary of 0.01455) in subjects with TPS ≥ 50% NSCLC. Therefore, subsequent secondary efficacy hypotheses beyond subjects with TPS ≥ 50% NSCLC were not formally tested at this interim analysis and would be tested at the final analysis.

The following secondary efficacy hypotheses were not formally tested neither at the interim analysis nor at the final one.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## TPS ≥ 20% NSCLC

PFS was comparable for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, with an HR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.11) in subjects with TPS ≥ 20% NSCLC. The median PFS was 6.2 months for pembrolizumab and 6.6 months for chemotherapy. Results from the final analysis were similar to those from the second interim analysis.

## TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC

PFS was comparable for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, with an HR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.21) in subjects with TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC. The median PFS was 5.4 months for pembrolizumab and 6.5 months for chemotherapy. Results from the final analysis were similar to those from the second interim analysis.

II One-sided p-value for testing. HO: difference in % = 0 versus H1: difference in % &gt; 0. Responses are based onBICR assessments per RECIST 1.1 with confirmation. DatabaseCutoffDate:04SEP2018

Based on Miettinen &amp; Nurminen method stratified by geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), PD-L1 expression status (TPS&gt;=50% vs. TPS 1-49%) and histology (squamous vs. non-squamous). If no subjects are in one of the treatment involved in a comparison for a particular stratum, then that stratum is excluded from the treatment comparison.

At the final analysis, PFS2 HRs were consistent with what was observed at the second interim analysis. A  total  of  262  subjects  (41.1%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  and  294  subjects  (46.2%)  in  the chemotherapy group received  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  upon  primary  therapy  discontinuation. Crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab was not part of the study design. At the time of data cut-off, 16 of 637 subjects on chemotherapy continued on treatment. Of the remaining 621 subjects in the chemotherapy group, 134 (21.0%) received a ch eckpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, or nivolumab) as subsequent therapy during survival follow-up.

Figure 16: Kaplan-Meier plot of OS landmark analysis for subjects with OS &gt;3 months (ITT population with TPS= 1-49%) - cutoff date 26-Feb-2018

To further explore the risk of early death, a comparison of baseline characteristics considered to be prognostic factors for treatment outcomes were evaluated in the overall TPS 149% population. In the pembrolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group, more subjects had baseline tumour size at/above the ITT population median (49.7% versus 44.8%), ≥3 metastasis sites (54.4% versus 49.0%), and liver metast ases at baseline (17.2% versus 13.1%).

The baseline risk factors for mortality among patients who died or were censored in the first 3 months were compared with those known to have survived for at least 3 months.

In subjects who died or were censored before 3 months versus after 3 months, a higher proportion of patients had liver metastasis at baseline (25.5% versus 13.2%), baseli ne tumour size at/above the ITT population median (73.6% versus 42.4%), ≥3 sites of metastasis (67.9% versus 48.7%), a higher mean number of lesions (5.8 versus 4.9) and a higher proportion of subjects with ECOG PS of 1 (80.2% versus 68.0%).

A stratified multivariate Cox regression analysis of OS with stepwise variable selection was carried out including the baseline characteristics identified above as well as other factors known to be of prognostic interest  in  NSCLC.  Baseline  tumour  size,  number  of  metastasis  sites,  and  liver  metastasis  status  at baseline were confirmed as risk factors for early mortality, with p-values based on the Wald test of &lt;0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively.

When adjusted by baseline tumour size, the number of metastasis sites, and liver metastasis status at baseline, the OS HR in favour of pembrolizumab in the TPS 149% subgroup improved from 0.92 to 0.83.

In addition, the MAH also proposed an alternative approach to further investigate the findings from the post hoc analysis, evaluating whether the early part of the survival curve in the TPS 149% subgroup was driven by subjects with poor prognosis, including high tumour burden. Evaluation of baseline factors with prognostic and predictive associations based on the totality of survival data was considered more appropriate for identifying patients at high risk (denoted as Control&gt;Treatment) as well as those who may benefit from the experimental therapy (denoted as Treatment&gt;Control).

Based on the predictive risk factor ranking, the baseline target tumour sum of longest diameters (SLD) was identified as the most important predictive factor for treatment benefit. A data driven cut-off of 149 mm was estimated based on a classification tree using only baseline tumour SLD as the risk factor. For

Figure 20 : Forest plot of OS hazard ratio by subgroup factor (ITT population with TPS≥1%) - cutoff date 26-Feb-2018

The results of the subgroup analyses for subjects with TPS ≥50% and ≥20% NSCLC were similar to those observed for the entire population (TPS ≥1% NSCLC).

## EU Region

While there was reasonable consistency across all analysed subgroups in KEYNOTE-042, an exploratory analysis  of  the  EU  subpopulation  was  undertaken  to  further  examine  the  treatment  effect  in  this subpopulation, in which the OS HR for the overall ITT population (TPS ≥ 1% NSCLC) in subjects enrolled in the EU was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.40), compared with 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.87) in non -EU subjects.

A stratified multivariate Cox regression analysis of OS with stepwise variable selection was carried out with  baseline  tumour  size,  number  of  metastasis  sites,  and  liver  metastasis  status  at  baseline  as covariates.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In the attempt to define predictors of early death and clinical parameters associated with response to treatment throughout the entire duration of the follow-up, a pooled analysis was presented including the Keynote024 dataset and subpopulation of TPS≥50% patients of KN-042.

† Ratio of HR measures the degree of heterogeneity in the treatment effect between two levels in a subgroup, with a ratio 1 indicating constant treatment effect across two levels of a subgroup. This ratio was estimated based on a multivariate cox regression model with the following covariates: treatment, liver metastasis, smoking status, ethnicity, prior radiation status, disease status, sex, age, histology and brain metastasis, and interactions between treatment and each of the above factors. Twosided nominal p-value is based on Wald test.

‡  Cannot be estimated because there were too few deaths by month 4 in the subgroup.

Considering the statistical significance emerged for the interaction between smoking status and treatment for both the early death time window and the full dataset, further analyses were requested in the form a 3-way interaction study to verify the contribution of other clinical parameters to these results, considering that some factors (i.e. histology and sex) generally present a typical association with the smoking status (i.e. females and non-squamous tumour prevailing within non-smokers) (see Table X).

## Patients &gt;75 years of age

The  pooled  OS  subgroup  analyses  of  KEYNOTE-024  and  KEYNOTE-042  in  the  TPS ≥ 50%  NSCLC population  with  age  &gt;75  years  showed  that  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  improved  OS  over chemotherapy in the first line treatment of subjects with a TPS ≥ 50% NSCLC and age &gt;75 years .

## Supportive study

The MAH presented an updated final OS analysis of KEYNOTE-024 as supportive study.

An additional 14 months of follow-up (data cutoff 10-JUL-2017) were included in the final OS compared to the prior IA2. The KEYNOTE-024 updated OS analysis presented in this submission based on the FA was not subjected to multiplicity control, because the previous analysis of OS and PFS were positive.

At the time of data cutoff, 14.9% of subjects in the pembrolizumab group and 1.3% of subjects in the chemotherapy group were continuing on their randomized study t reatment, and 24.4% of subjects in the  chemotherapy group remained on treatment with pembrolizumab in the crossover phase of the study.  A mong  the  subjects  randomized  to  chemotherapy,  54%  crossed  over  to  treatment  with pembrolizumab in the crossover phase of the study, as specified within the protocol. In the crossover p hase,  45%  of  these  crossover  subjects  received  pembrolizumab  for  ≥ 6  months and  21% received pembrolizumab  for ≥ 12  months .  Another  8%  of  subjects  in  the  chemotherapy  group  received immunotherapy as second-line therapy outside the context of the study.

Similar results were observed for the analysis of OS up to month 4, in which the OS HR (0.67) was consistent with the OS for the entire follow-up period (0.63) and no effects of tumour burden or liver metastasis, nor their interactions with treatment, were observed.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

In the NSCLC indication, pembrolizumab monotherapy is already approved for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic disease in PDL1 highly positive patients (≥50% TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations and in PDL1 positive patients (≥1% TPS) who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, including approved target therapy for EGFR and ALK aberrations in case of positive tumour mutations. Pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel were also recently approved for the treatment of, respectively, non-squamous and squamous NSCLC treatment-naïve patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression.

This application has been submitted to extend the Keytruda indication to the treatment of PD-L1 positive (1% TPS) advanced and metastatic NSCLC in treatment naïve patients.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

KN-042 is a Phase 3 randomised, open-label, clinical study testing the efficacy and safety profile of pembrolizumab against standard of care (i.e. platinum-based doublets) in treatment-naïve advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients, including both squamous and non-squamous histology, who present with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ALK/EGFR  negative  disease  and  a  level  of  PD-L1  tumour  expression  (TPS) ≥1%.  The  MAH initially submitted data derived from the IA2 with a date cut-off of 26-FEB-2018. During the procedure results were updated based on the planned final analysis (data cut-off of 4-SEP-2018); an additional extended OS analysis was presented, with cut-off date of 25-OCT-2019.  In addition, the final OS analysis of KN024 was submitted, i.e. the pivotal trial based on which pembrolizumab was approved in the first-line setting  of  NSCLC  with  TPS ≥50%. Although being  considered  by  the  MAH  supportive  to  the  current application,  KN-024  does  not  provide  additional  efficacy  data  on  NSCLC  patients  with  a  TPS  score between 149%, which is the population of interest to the sought extension of indication. Nevertheless, an indirect comparison between KN-024 and KN-042 offers important points for discussion in terms of overall clinical performance of pembrolizumab monotherapy in NSCLC patients with TPS ≥50%.

The choice of platinum-based doublets as comparator reflects the currently recommended standard-ofcare; however, pemetrexed maintenance was optional for patients with non-squamous histology, despite current recommendations which could have led to an underperformance of the chemotherapy arm. In the study , 23.5% of the non -squamous patients who were assigned to the control group and started treatment did not receive pemetrexed maintenance because maintenance was not planned/specified at the time of randomization.

As regards the open-label nature of the clinical trial, it should be acknowledged that the risk of bias was mitigated by the choice of the primary endpoint OS, and the blinded independent review of radiographic imaging based on which the secondary endpoints PFS and ORR were defined.

The calculation of the sample size, which was based on hypotheses formulated within the TPS≥50% population, is deemed adequate.

Histology subtype (squamous vs non-squamous), PDL1 expression status (based on TPS score of 50% as the cut-point level) were among the randomisation factors (in addition to ECOG PS and geographic region).  The  allocation  to  the  experimental  therapy  (pembrolizumab)  or  the  comparator  arm  was therefore well balanced as regards these clinical variables for a proper statistical analysis. However, while the randomisation was stratified based on a TPS score ≥ 50% or &lt; 50%, the OS analys is by an intermediate cut-off value of ≥20% with a step -down to TPS ≥1% was added with protocol amendment 3. The MAH specified that the intermediate cut-off point of TPS ≥ 20% was selected based on a B-value plot of data from a different trial, Study KEYNOTE-010. In particular, the cutoff of 20% was chosen because its corresponding relative treatment effect (distance to diagonal line) was relatively similar to that observed at TPS ≥ 50% (the maximum distance from the diagonal line).

The study design was amended in several occasions with a change in the target number of events from the initial 354 OS events to 340 (Amendment 03), and finally 398 events (Amendment 06). The supposed HR in the TPS ≥ 50% population changed from 0.70 to 0.65. No sensitivity analysis was planned to handle missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The study population of the pivotal study KN-042 (1274 patients in total, 637 each in the pembrolizumab and control arm) can be considered overall representative of the population targeted by the sought indication with regard to disease staging (87.4% stage IV, 10.8% stage IIIB and 1.8% stage IIIA) and histology (61.7% non -squamous and 38.6% squamous).

Baseline characteristics as well as demographics appear well balanced between treatment arms in the ITT  population  (TPS ≥1%).  Demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  also  similar  between experimental and control groups as stratified by the PD-L1 cut-off levels, with the exception, within both the TPS≥20% ≥50% groups, of a slight difference in tumo ur sizes above the ITT median between arms (50.7% vs 38.7% and 51.8% vs 40.7% in the pembro lizumab and control, respectively). The prevalence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  the  different  PDL-1  score  within  the  study  population  is  adequately  representative  of  the  distinct categories (35.2% and 36.4% in the pembrolizumab and control arm for TPS 119%; 17.9% and 16.5% in pembrolizumab and control group for TPS 2049%; 46.9% and 47.1% in pembrolizumab and control group for TPS ≥50% ), thus rendering the efficacy analysis by TPS numerically appropriate. Nevertheless, a remarkable low number of females is included in the study. Due to the exclusion of patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations, no data are available for this group of patients. Moreover, data are restricted to patients with good performance status and adequate organ functions.

At the IA2 (cut-off date: 26-Feb-2018), the median duration of follow-up was 13.4 months and 12.2 months for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The comparison between pembrolizumab and SoC within the ITT population comprising all patients with a TPS ≥1% demonstrated superiority of pembrolizumab vs SoC, with a gain of 4 months in median OS and HR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71, 0 .93; p=0.0018). As expected, the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy increased by PD-L1 score, with the highest advantage in OS being observed in the TPS ≥ 50% subcategory (a gain of 8 months with HR 0.69;95% CI: 0.56, 0.85; p=0.0003), which slightly decreased in the TPS ≥ 20% group (a gain of around 4 months in OS with HR 0.77;95% CI: 0.64, 0.92; p=0.0020) . These results were achieved with an OS maturity of 89.9% at IA2.

During the procedure, the MAH provided results of the final analysis (data cutoff: 04-Sep-2018), with additional 6 months of follow-up compared to IA2. Overall, the final analysis results confirmed previous findings from IA2. Moreover, an extended OS analysis with cutoff date of 25-Oct-2019 was submitted, providing 14 months of additional follow-up from the last reported protocol-specified FA. These newly presented  data  consolidate  the  previous  analyses  showing  a  long-term  benefit  of  pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy in terms of OS gain within the ITT population, with the magnitude of the long-term benefit being dependent upon PD-L1 level of expression.

Differently  from  what  had  been  observed  in  KN-024,  in  which  the  KM  curves  for  OS  demonstrated continuous separation from Month 1 favouring pembrolizumab, KN-042 showed an initial advantage of SoC over pembrolizumab with a crossing of OS KM curves at Month 8 that was reported in the ITT population. Importantly, such higher risk of early death is evident also for the TPS ≥ 50% subgroup, with OS KM curves crossing at month 7 (see below risk of early death).

Unlike study KN-024, the analysis of PFS as assessed by BICR in study KN042 within the TPS ≥ 50% group did not show a statistically significant benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy (HR=0.81, 95%  CI  0.67 -0.99;  p=0.0170  for  a  tested  p-value=0.01455).  Although  a  trend  towards  a  more advantageous overall effect of pembrolizumab vs control can be recognised, the Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS show an early separation in favour of chemotherapy up to Month 6, when the curves cross. The HR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.80 -1.11) in TPS ≥20% and 1.07 (95% CI 0.94 -1.21) in TPS ≥1%. Investigator -based analyses were consistent with the independent data review.

Similarly, no statistically significant superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was demonstrated in ORR (CR+PR, 39.5% vs 32%), while disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was higher for chemotherapy, regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression, even in the TPS ≥50% subgroup (76.3% vs 68.9%). A progressive  decline  in  ORR  was  observed  according  to  a  reduction  in  TPS  score,  so  that  in  the  ITT population (TPS ≥1%) an even more marked advantage of SoC vs pembrolizumab was reported in terms of dise ase control rate (78.8% vs 65.9% in chemotherapy and pembrolizumab, respectively). However, responders  to  pembrolizumab  had  a  longer  response  duration  compared  to  the  control  group  (20.2 months vs 8.3 months in median). Data were confirmed by investigator-based analyses.

As regards PFS2, pembrolizumab performed better than chemotherapy in all TPS categories.

## Efficacy data in TPS 1-49% NSCLC subgroup

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Even though an optimal cut-off was not known when the studies were designed, a relationship between PD-L1 expression level and pembrolizumab activity was known: the principle outlined in several SAs on the need to provide enough evidence in the complementary PD-L1 expression subgroups when it was expected that results in the overall population could be driven by the most responsive subgroup should have been followed.

The MAH provided OS subgroup analysis for TPS 149% that was pre-specified in the protocol, although as exploratory, which is considered relevant in the context of this extension of indication from TPS≥50% to TPS≥ 1 % NSCLC patients. The overall effect (OS HR=0.81, 95%IC: 0.71 -0.93) in the ITT population (TPS≥1%) seems to be driven by the strong effect observed in the TPS≥50% group (HR=0.69, 95%CI 0.56-0.85). The first part of the OS KM curves for the TPS 149% subgroup fav oured chemotherapy, and then the curves started to approach one another and crossed around Month 10 (see also discussion on risk of early death).

PFS in TPS 149% NSCLC appears clearly in favour of the standard treatment (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.12, 1.56, median PFS 4.2 vs 6.8 months). Of note, DOR in this subgroup is doubled compared to control, with  median  DOR:  17.4  vs  8.2  months.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  responders  was  lower  in  the pembrolizumab group vs. the chemotherapy group with response rates of 16.5% vs 21.3%, respectively.

Overall, no superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy could be detected. The MAH stated that the  exploratory  subgroup  analysis  for  TPS  149%  was  pre -specified  in  the  protocol  but  was underpowered and formal hypothesis testing was not planned in the SAP. This is not agreed, since patients  with  TPS  149% contributed to 53% of the study population, and 56% of the total deaths occurred in this group. Therefore, it is considered that the study provided a reliable estimate of treatment effect in the TPS 149% population.

## Risk of early death

The  fact  that  the  survival  curves  crossed  around  month  6  in  all  TPS  groups  not  only  poses  a methodological concern in using the Cox model for the primary analysis, but also raises doubts on the opportunity  to  express  the  treatment  effect  over  time  with  an  overall  HR.  In  light  of  the  statistical hypotheses that underly the study, the MAH was asked to provide the treatment effect before month 6 and after month 6 for all the three TPS groups and provide the additional sensitivity analyses planned to address the issue of the violation of proportional hazards.

The provided HRs were above 1 for both OS and PFS before 6 months, and below 1 after 6 months, across  all  TPS  scores.  Restricted  mean  survival  time  (RMST)  was  provided  as  protocol  pre-specified sensitivity analysis in the event of proportional hazard (PH) violation. The RMST is, in fact, suitable even in the absence of PH. According to the RMST analyses, for TPS≥1%, the OS was not statistically different till month 18, with only a modest improvement after 24 months (1.17 months) and 30 months (1.76 months) of follow up. No improvement in PFS was observed. The same considerations apply to the TPS≥20% subgroup where the OS improved by 1.33 months after 24 months and 1.91 months after 30 months  of  follow  up.  This  sensitivity  analysis  is  not  supporting  a  clinically  significant  effect  of pembrolizumab in the TPS≥1% population. On the contrary, a long -term benefit of pembrolizumab on both PFS and OS can be recognised in the TPS≥50% subgroup with a gain of 2.81 months in OS after 30 months of follow-up. However, no effect was observed up to 6 months of follow-up, and between 12 and 18 months of therapy the OS improvement achieved with pembrolizumab is marginal (data not shown). The first part of the OS KM curves for the TPS 149% subgroup favour chemotherapy, and then the curves start to approach one another and cross around Month 10. A piecewise hazard rate analysis revealed a detrimental effect of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy during the first 3 months of treatment (HR of 1.29, 1.95 and 2.13 at Month 1, 2 and 3 respectively) in this subgroup, with a total of 66 OS events  occurring  in  the  experimental  arm  vs  37  in  the  control  arm.  A  comparison  of  the  baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

characteristics between treatment arms showed some slight unbalance in tumour size (under/above ITT median; 49.7% vs 44.8% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively), metastasis sites (≥3 or less than 3; 54.4% vs 49% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively) and liver metastasis (17.2% vs 13.1% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively) that could have favoured chemotherapy in the first 3 months.

The observed crossing of OS KM curves in the TPS≥50% subgroup is relevant for the currently approved indication and a similar piecewise hazard rate analysis was requested for this subgroup. The monthly piecewise hazard rate demonstrated a higher risk in pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy in the first two months and at month 4, with HR 1.69, 1.94 and 1.84 respectively. Therefore, the MAH has selected  the  4-month  cutoff  for  the  evaluation  of  baseline  potential  risk  factors  in  the TPS  ≥50% subgroup which is acceptable. The MAH identified some variables indicative of burden of disease as predictors of early deaths since they were more common in patients who died before 4 months vs after 4 months (baseline tumour size, number of metastasis sites, and liver metastasis status at baseline). Consequently, an adjusted Cox model was run with these factors used as covariates.

The MAH performed additional post-hoc analyses in the ITT population, and in both TPS 149% and TPS&gt;=50% groups, in order to identify factors/combination of factors able to explain the early crossing of curves. The max-combo test was also suggested, to take into account the PH violation in detecting differences in survival between subgroups identified by possible combination of factors. The MAH also performed the random forest classification for TPS 149% population.

The MAH concluded that in subjects with TPS ≥ 50% and ≥ 1% NSCLC, baseline liver metastasis and never smoker  status  appeared  to  predict  poorer  response  to  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  the  initial  4 months of treatment, and the observed OS benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy was improved by excluding these subjects from the analysis.

A more evident unbalance in tumour sizes above the ITT median was observed between treatments within both the TPS≥20% (50.7% vs 38.7%) and TPS≥50% groups (51.8% vs 40.7% in pembrolizumab and control, respectively).

In the TPS 149% subgroup, no definitive factors predictive of early mortality were identified with the proposed in-depth analyses and the Random Forest analysis identifying the tumour burden as the most important predictive factor, corroborating findings of the previous analyses. However, some factors were excluded from these analyses and some indications of interaction between factors and treatment were not adequately explored. Several factors were indicated that seem to be associated to an increased risk of Pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy, but they were not adequately explored. Furthermore, these analyses are limited due to the exploratory nature, the lack of multiplicity control, and the limited number  of  events  occurring  in  the  first  months.  Additionally,  factors  indicated  by  the  CHMP  to  be associated with an increased risk of early death with pembrolizumab treatment compared with platinumdoublet chemotherapy were included in a multivariate model to further explore treatment interaction for the dataset restricted to early death window and for the full dataset. Contradicting results in terms of potential predictive factors were observed in TPS 149% and TPS ≥ 50% subgroups, making any statement on the ITT population of TPS ≥ 1% inconclusive.

Overall, no clear explanation, even from the biological perspective, was provided for the early death observation. The provided data do not to alleviate the CHMP concerns on the higher risk of early death observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy vs SoC in this setting. This is even more relevant for the TPS 149% group for which no clear long -term benefit has been observed, making the uncertainty on the short-term outcome not acceptable.

For both the TPS-149% and TPS≥50% subgroups, t he MAH was also asked to investigate the cause of death for each of the OS events occurring in each arm before the crossing of the K-M OS curves, and, separately, for those occurring in the timeframes in which a higher risk of death for pembrolizumab was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identified based on piecewise hazard rate analyses (e.g. 3 months for the TPS 149% subgroup) . The main cause of death during both the follow-up period before the K-M OS curve crossing (10.3 months for TPS 149% and 6.7 months for TPS≥50%) and the first months of therapy that were unfavourable for pembrolizumab as based on piecewise HRs (3 months for TPS 149% and 4 months for TPS≥50%), was malignant progression. More cases of malignant progression were reported in the pembrolizumab arm in the two distinct PDL1 level of expression subpopulations (TPS≥50%: 34/299 [11.4%] vs 24/300 [8%] before 4 months; TPS 1 -49%: 33/338 [9.8%] vs 19/337 [5.6%] before 3 months). Although the benefit/risk balance of pembrolizumab in the TPS ≥50% population is not questioned, the higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

An  additional  analysis  was  run  to  compare  the  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  who  died/were censored within the first 3 months and those who survived for at least 3 months, in order to identify risk factors for early death. Since the variables identified by the MAH as risk factors for early death were the same for which an unbalance at baseline was observed, a multivariate Cox model using a stepwise selection was performed, by using the baseline characteristics identified above as well as other factors known to be prognostic in NSCLC. The model was applied to the entire follow-up period, and therefore the totality of the events, and resulted in an improvement of the HR from 0.92 to 0.83. In order to better understand how much the higher risk in treatment group in the first 3 months could be explained by this bias, the MAH was asked to limit the multivariate analysis to the first 3 months of follow-up only. The MAH has conducted a data analysis limited to the initial period of treatment when a major risk of fatalities for pembrolizumab was observed. A multivariate analysis was conducted for the first 3 (TPS 149%) and 4 months (TPS ≥50% and TPS ≥1%) of follow -up only. Additional analyses were conducted using both the  Cox  regression  model  and  Random  Forest  for  early  death,  in  order  to  test  several  factors  for treatment interaction within the early time window as well as the full dataset. However, results were somewhat inconsistent across PD-L1 subgroups not allowing to identify credible predictive factors of high risk of early death or overall response to pembrolizumab. This is even more relevant for the TPS 149% in  which  no  clear  long-term  benefit  has  been  observed,  making  the  uncertainty  on  the  short  term outcome not justified.

The analysi s performed in subjects with TPS≥50% were requested to be replicated in study KN024 in order to get all the available information. Moreover, for a better understanding of the inconsistency between study KN042 and KN024, the MAH was asked to provide a comparison of the risk factors, especially those found to correlate to risk of early death between the two trials, by treatment group. The between-arm  comparison  in  KEYNOTE-024  of  the  clinical  characteristics  of  subjects  who  died/were censored before 4 months revealed an opposite trend in the distribution of factors associated with higher tumour burden including baseline tumour size and liver metastasis (more frequent in the chemotherapy than pembrolizumab group) with respect to the observed frequency of these in KEYNOTE-042 (more frequent in pembrolizumab than chemo). Consistent with this, more patients among those treated with pembrolizumab  and  who  died/were  censored  before  4  months  had  liver  metastasis  at  baseline  in KEYNOTE042 (35.2% vs 16.7% in the chemo ar m) compared to KEYNOTE024 (13.0% vs 32.3% in the chemo arm). Although with a less pronounced difference, an unbalance between trials was observed also in  tumour  burden&gt;median  (68.5%  vs  56.5%  in  KEYNOYE -042  vs  KEYNOTE-024  respectively  in  the pembrolizumab group with a similar rate in their respective chemo arms: 71.4% and 74.2%). Moreover, a higher tumour size at baseline characterised patients in the pembrolizumab group of KEYNOTE-042 (140.3 mm in mean) compared to KEYNOYE-024 (97.7 mm in mean), with a similar value in the chemo group of the two trials (148.9 and 142.5 mm). The MAH reported no interaction or influence of these parameters indicative of aggressive disease on OS HR in the individual analysis of KEYNOTE-024 during both, the entire follow-up period and the first 4 months of treatment. However, it is acknowledged that the different distributions of these factors between KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 could potentially explain  the  difference  in  outcomes  observed  between  the  two  studies.  The  MAH  explored  factors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identified  in  subjects  with  TPS ≥ 50%  NSCLC  KN -042  as  predictor  of  higher  risk  of  early  death  in Pembrolizumab group compared with chemotherapy, also in the study KN-024. In this study the crossing of  curves  was  not  observed  and  therefore  the  analysis  was  limited  to  the  first  4  months  only  for uniformity. Exploration of factors/combination of factors identified in subjects with TPS ≥50% NSCLC from KEYNOTE-042 in KEYNOTE-024 did not demonstrate consistent findings. A possible explanation could be the different histology in the two studies, since in KN042, 37% of the recruited TPS≥50% population had squamous tumour while in KN024 was 18%. The individual analysis of KN-024 and KN042  was  somewhat  inconclusive,  and  for  some  aspects  even  contradictory.  Particularly,  the  MAH concluded that presence of baseline liver metastasis suggests a poor outcome for pembrolizumab in the first  4  months  of  treatment;  however,  the  statistical  significance  related  to  this  parameter  in  the treatment interaction analysis does not seem to indicate a relevant effect and was not confirmed in the multivariate model applied to all data. The uncertainty of the finding is further reinforced by lack of data reproducibility in KN-024, where results show an even opposite direction for this parameter within the same time window. The interaction between liver metastasis and treatment is absent in the pooled analysis as both limited to the early death time window and the whole dataset. Pooled analyses from Study KN-042 and KN-024 seem to suggest that the never smoker status is predictor of poor outcome on pembrolizumab both in the early time window and in the whole dataset follow-up.

Given the impact of these findings on the currently approved indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy fo r patients with TPS ≥50%, further exploration of these data testing combination of more factors (i.e. a 3 term interaction factor analysis) was undertaken revealing that among the different clinical parameters included in the model, histology (but not liver metastasis) seems to interact with smoking status and treatment by judging on the basis of a significant p value (0.034) in the pooled population analysis. In particular, the OS K-M curves showed that smokers and never smokers within the non-squamous histology group present with an opposite trend in terms of response to chemotherapy that consequently makes the effect of pembrolizumab more advantageous in the smokers and less advantageous in non-smokers compared to chemotherapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1

## of the SmPC). Pemetrexed maintenance

The  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  over  chemotherapy  as  expressed  by  OS  HR  appears  higher  when compared against absence than presence of pemetrexed maintenance across all TPS scores. Considering the optimal SoC only, which includes the group receiving pemetrexed maintenance, data (ITT=341 pts assigned  to  chemotherapy  vs  328  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.89  [95%  CI:  0.73,  1.09],  p=0.124) confirm the trend of the primary outcome in the total study population (TPS ≥ 1%; ITT=637 pts assigned to  chemo  vs  637  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.81  [95%  CI:  0.71,  0.93],  p=0.0018) .  The  same consideration can be applied to the TPS ≥ 50% subpopulation (ITT=166 pts assigned to chemotherapy vs  157  to  pembrolizumab;  OS  HR:0.83  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.12],  p=0.11 29)  when  compared  with  the respective  group  encompassing  all  histologies  (ITT=300  pts  assigned  to  chemotherapy  vs  299  to pembrolizumab; OS HR:0.69 [95% CI: 0.56, 0.85], p=0.0003). Therefore, it can be concluded that Investigator's choice of pemetrexed maintenance did not constitute a bias in data interpretation and analysis (Data not shown).

## Subgroup analyses

The efficacy of the experimental treatment in the advanced cancer (stage III) was similar to the one observed in both the metastatic tumour and the o verall population. Although limited to 12.6% of the ITT population, the prevalence of patients with 'locally advanced' tumour comprising stages IIIA and IIIB is consistent with the expected distribution of disease stages at diagnosis in the 'real world'. Moreover, there were no unbalances in the number of patients with stage III cancer between treatment arms. For completeness, the MAH specified upon request disease stage in the baseline characteristics of study KN042 reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The prevalence of locally advanced cancer within the TPS ≥

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

50% group was 10.4% (62 subjects). Due to the small number of subjects, the efficacy data from this post  hoc  subgroup  analysis  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  however  the  efficacy  data  in  locally advanced disease are consistent with results in metastatic cancer patients.

The geographic area was associated with a variable degree of efficacy of pembrolizumab compared to control, with a lower performance in OS being reported for the EU (HR 1.05; 95% C I 0.79-1.40) than nonEU region (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63 -0.87). A stratified multivariate COX-regression analysis adjusted by  the  metastasis  number,  tumour  size  and  liver  metastasis  at  baseline  only  slightly  modified  the outcome (HR for EU-region of 0.98).

The MAH presented results across the different PD-L1 categories as stratified by histology and showed that  squamous  and  non-squamous  NSCLC  behave  similarly  in  terms  of  response  to  pembrolizumab regardless of PD-L1 score. In comparing the KM curves of the control arms, the squamous histology presented with a worse clinical outcome than the non-squamous tumour subtype, and this resulted into an apparent higher advantage of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy for the squamous histology, across all the different TPS categories, albeit differences between histologies were not statistically significant.

The MAH has discussed the negative effect of pembrolizumab in PFS for females and never smokers by comparing the subgroup point estimates of the PFS forest plots with the overall population, together with the OS forest plots of study KEYNOTE-042, to conclude that a dissociation between PFS and OS was observed in both subgroups and similarly to the overall TPS≥1% population. The results of a post-hoc exploratory  subgroup  analysis  indicated  a  trend  towards  reduced  survival  benefit  of  pembrolizumab compared  to  chemotherapy,  during  both  the  first  4  months  and  throughout  the  entire  duration  of treatment, in patients who were never-smokers. However, due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis, no definitive conclusions can be drawn (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The increases in the risk of early death, particularly marked in the subgroup of patients expressing PDL1 149% TPS , and the lack of identified clinical indicators for the proper selection of patients do not allow concluding on a benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy. The MAH during the procedure decided to no longer pursue the extension of indication to include the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer tumours for patients expressing PD-L1  149%  TPS,  based  on  data  from  study  KEYNOTE -042.  The  scope  of  the  Type  II  variation application is therefore revised to reflect an update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the data from KEYNOTE-042.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event.

A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding

AEs were followed 30 days after last dose of study treatment.

SAE is monitored until 90 days after last dose.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event.

A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

AEs were followed 30 days after last dose of study treatment.

SAE is monitored unti1 90 days after last dose.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event.

A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

MedDRA preferred terms \"Neoplasm Progression\" and \"Malignant Neoplasm Progression\" not related to the drug are excluded.

SAE is monitored until 90 days after last dose.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event.

A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

MedDRA preferred terms \"Neoplasm Progression\" and \"Malignant Neoplasm Progression\" not related to the drug are excluded.

AEs were followed 30 days after last dose of study treatment.

SAE is monitored until 90 days after last dose.

Database Cutoff Date: 26FEB2018

Source:[P042V01MK3475: adam-adsl; adae]

At the final analysis, the incidence of deaths due to AEs was 10.7% (68) in the pembrolizumab group and 7.6% (47) in the chemotherapy group. The incidences of deaths due to drug -related AEs were similar in the 2 treatment groups (pembrolizumab: 2.0%; chemotherapy: 2.3%).

## Laboratory findings

In the KEYNOTE042 Dataset, the most frequently reported (incidence &gt;30%) laboratory abnormalities with a clinically meaningful  worsening  in  CTCAE  grade  (all  grades)  in  subjects  treated with pembrolizumab were increased glucose (51.8%), decreased haemoglobin (43.1%), decreased albumin (33.3%), increased ALT (32.9%), increased AST (31.4%), and decreased sodium (30.6%).  There were no important differences from the Reference Safety Dataset in the incidence of laboratory abnormalities.

Nearly all changes from baseline in laboratory abnormalities in KEYNOTE-042 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2.

Grade  3  to  4  laboratory  abnormalities  occurred  much  more  frequently  in  subjects  treated  with chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab. Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality occurred in &gt;9% of subjects treated with pembrolizumab, whereas abnormalities in several parameters were observed in &gt;10% of subjects treated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in the pembrolizumab group occurred with similar or lower frequencies compared with those in the chemotherapy group. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in both treatment groups were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- For pembrolizumab (&gt;4%): decreased sodium (8.7%), decreased lymphocytes (7.3%), ALT increased (4.8%), increased glucose (4.7%), decreased phosphate (4.7%), and decreased haemoglobin (4.4%).
-  For  chemotherapy  (&gt;4%):  decreased haemoglobin (19.1%),  decreased  neutrophils  (18.1%), decreased leukocytes (13.0%), decreased lymphocytes (12.7%), decreased platelets (9.3%), decreased sodium (8.4%), increased glucose (5.1%), and decreased phosphate (4.3%).

## Post marketing experience

The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the period 03-Sept-2018 through 03-Sep-2019.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH presented a comparison of the safety profile of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy as first-line treatment of NSCLC through an individual analysis of Study KN-042 (ASaT population: 636 and 615 patients in the pembrolizumab and control arm) as well as a pooled database incorporating KN-042 and KN-024 (ASaT population: 790 and 765 patients in the pembrolizumab and control arm). The safety data derived from the clinical experience with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of NSCLC was compared to the Reference Dataset (RDS; N=3830) and cumulative Database (CDS; N=5246), mainly including trials of pembrolizumab in the second-line therapy of distinct clinical indications.

The duration of exposure was longer for pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (mean 253.3 vs 156.6 d ays and median number of administrations 9 vs. 6, respectively). A total of 302 (47.5%) subjects in the pembrolizumab group and 143 (23.3%) subjects in the chemotherapy group received treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for ≥ 6 months. As expected for the 1L NSCLC setting the mean exposure to pembrolizumab in KN042 was  also  longer  compared  with  the  RSD  (8.3  months  vs  6.7  months,  respectively)  as  were  the proportions of subjects exposed to pembrolizumab for ≥12 months (29.4% vs 20.5%).

Pembrolizumab treatment favorably compares with chemotherapy in terms of drugrelated AEs (62.7% vs 89.9%), Grade≥3 AEs (50% vs 57.1%), drug -related Grade≥3 AEs (17.8% vs 41%), serious drug -related AEs (13.7 vs 14.6%). Similarly, pembrolizumab treatment favorably compares with chemotherapy in relation to treatment discontinuation due to drugrelated AEs (19.2% vs 14.5%) and treatment discontinuation due to SAEs (16% vs 9.3%) and drug -related SAEs (6.1% vs 4.2%). The longer exposure of patients to pembrolizumab rather than chemotherapy (9 vs. 6 administrations in median) accounts for an even more favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab following adjustment by exposure time (overall AEs rate of 83.16 vs 170.33 events/100 person-months). Similarly, exposureadjusted grade 3-5 AEs (10.49 vs 21.85 events/100 person-months) and SAEs (6.93 vs 8.05 events/100 person-months) occurred at a lower frequency in the pembrolizumab than control arm, while a similar incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was found between treatments (2.25 vs 2.74 events/100 person-months).

As  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  disease  specific  setting  and  prior  experience  with  pembrolizumab, endocrine (hypothyroidism), skin (rash) and respiratory disorders (dyspnoea, cough and pneumonia) were the most commonly reported AEs in the experimental arm of KN042 (&gt;10% incidence), while gastrointestinal (vomiting, constipation and nausea) and blood disturbances (myelosuppression) were the prevailing AEs in the chemotherapy group (all of them with an incidence &gt;10%). The incidence of overall  AEs  in  the  KN-042  pembrolizumab  dataset  was  comparable  to  the  RDS  and  CDS;  however, pneumonia occurred more frequently in the pivotal trial than previously reported (11.9% incidence vs 4.7% and 5.4% in the RDS and CDS, respectively) likely due to the underlying disease of the study population.

Drugrelated AEs were more commonly reported in the chemotherapy (89.9%) than pembrolizumab (62.7%) group.

Overall analysis of Grade 3 to 5 AEs was in favour of the pembrolizumab group; Grade 3 to 5 AEs were reported in  50.0% of subjects in the pembrolizumab group and 57.1% in the chemotherapy group. Analysis of exposure-adjusted event rates of Grade 3 to 5 AEs showed that the rate for pembrolizumab group was half of the rate for the chemotherapy group (10.49 vs 21.85 events/100 person-months) and the  median  time  to  first  Grade  3  to  5  AE  was  longer  in  the  pembrolizumab  group  than  in  the chemotherapy  group  (49.4  weeks  vs  17.0  weeks).  These  numerical  differences  in  Grade  3-5  AEs appeared to be mainly driven by the higher proportion of haematological toxicities in the chemotherapy group.

Among the Grade 3-5 AEs, pneumonitis was the main event that was causally-related to pembrolizumab in study KN042 (3.1% vs 0% in the control), followed by drug -related ALT incr ease (1.4% vs 0.8%); both  of  them  presented  with  a  higher  frequency  than  in  the  prior  datasets  (1.2%  and  1.3%  for pneumonitis  in  the  RDS  and  CDS;  0.5%  and  0.7%  for  ALT  increase  in  the  RDS  and  CDS)  as  also confirmed by the exposure-adjustment analysis. Similar considerations apply to the analysis of SAEs, for which pneumonia was reported in 7.4% of patients receiving pembrolizumab vs 5.2% assigned to chemotherapy (no cases of pneumonia were considered drugrelated), and pneumonitis in 3.9% of the experimental  arm  (all  cases  considered  drugrelated)  vs  0.2%  in  the  control.  The  incidence  of pneumonitis as drug-related SAE was higher in KN042 (3.9%) compared to the RDS (1.8%) and CDS (1.7%); this is likely due to the specific NSCLC -disease setting. The MAH provided further analyses on immune-related  pneumonitis,  and  consequently  updated  the  SmPC  to  present  incidence  rates  of pneumonitis for all patients, for patients with NSCLC and for subjects with and without prior thoracic irradiation in the pooled monotherapy population.

Additionally, numerically higher rates for Grade 3 to 5 cardiac disorders were notable with 4.4% for pembrolizumab  in  KN042  vs.  2.8%  in  the  Reference  Safety  Dataset;  (Exposure  adjusted  rates  for cardiac disorders were 0.6 events/100 person-months in the pembrolizumab group of KN-042 compared to 0.3 in the chemotherapy group of KN-042). Rates of drug-related grade 3-5 cardiac disorders were 1.4% vs. 0.2%, respectively. Of note are the high incidences of serious cardiac disorder events in the pembrolizumab arm of KN-042. Serious cardiac disorders were also slightly higher compared to the RSD. In the analysis of SAEs by SOC 4.2% of subjects experienced a cardiac disorder in the KN -042 Dataset for pembrolizumab compared to 3.1% of subjects in the RSD. The higher rate of events in the KEYNOTE042 pembrolizumab group was driven by increases in the frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs of cardiac arrest, cardiac failure/cardiac failure acute, myocardial infarction, and, more notably, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade as compared with chemotherapy and the RSD. However, interpretation of these data is difficult. It is acknowledged that the observed differences may be partially related to the longer exposure to pembrolizumab in the 1L NSCLC setting and that underlying disease progression and pre-existing conditions are confounding factors to assess the clear contribution of pembrolizumab to the manifestation  of  the  events.  Moreover,  small  events  numbers  further  hamper  drawing  definitive conclusions. However, cardiac toxicity will need persistent attention with further evolving safety data.

A  higher  rate  of  deaths  due  to  AEs  in  the  KN042  was  observed  with  pembrolizumab  arm  (11%) compared to chemotherapy (7.5%). The overall incidence of deaths due to AEs in this trial was even higher compared with the Reference Safety Dataset (4.1%), and with Study KN -024 (7.8%). The cause of  death  was  most  frequently  unknown  (10/70  patients,  1.6%), followed  by pneumonia  (1.3%), pulmonary  embolism  (0.9%),  pulmonary  haemorrhage  (0.6%)  and  respiratory  failure  (0.5%).  The findings of a higher rate of deaths compared to Study KN-024, together with the observation of the higher risk of early deaths reported in Study KN-042 (but not in Study KN-024) raises concerns. A review of AEs resulting in death for each arm, ordered by the time from randomization and the type of event did not raise concerns. They were mainly respiratory and cardiovascular causes, the majority of them being not considered causally related to the study drug by the Investigator.

While the number of subjects who died due to an AE was generally similar between the pembrolizumab and  chemotherapy  groups  for  subjects  with TPS ≥50%, more subjects died due to an AE in the pembrolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group for TPS 149% group. This is driven by the higher percentage of subjects with PD as the best overall response. Across all subgroups a large proportion of patients had 'no assessment', probably related to an early death with no subsequent imaging assessment for response. Overall, these data indicate that the higher rates of death due to an AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low PD-L1 expression subgroup than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy.

No major differences emerged in the analysis of safety in special populations that showed a similar profile across  patient  subgroups  by  either  intrinsic  or  extrinsic  factors,  between  KN-042  and  the  reference datasets.

The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  AEs  generally  increased  with  increasing  age  for  all  AE categories for both pembrolizumab and chemotherapy and no major concerns emerged regarding the tolerability of pembrolizumab monotherapy in elderly NSCLC patients (although the limitations of the still small patient numbers in the age group beyond 75 years have be taken into account).

In terms of AEs leading to drug discontinuation, the exposure-adjusted analysis indicates a similar profile of pembrolizumab between study KN-042 and the reference datasets.

Finally, AEOSIs in KN-042 occurred at a similar frequency than previously reported with the exception of hypothyroidism (12.1% vs 9.1% in RSD and 9.6% in CSD), pneumonitis (8.3% vs 3.7% in RSD and 4% in CSD) and hyperthyroidism (6.1% vs 3.5% in RSD and 3.8% in CSD) which could be attributable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to both the longer treatment in KN-042 than the reference datasets as well as NSCLC disease-specific setting.  Of  note,  the  majority  of  these  events  were  of  Grade  1-2.  As  discussed  above,  the  higher incidence  of  pneumonitis  and  the  relative  figures  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  analysis  of hypothyroidism  and  hyperthyroidism  events  was  comparable  in  NSCLC  and  non-NSCLC  populations, therefore the SmPC has not been updated.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy that emerges from KN-042 is overall consistent with the prior clinical experience. Of note, the comparison with chemotherapy revealed a more favourable outcome achieved with pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. Further analyses indicated that the higher rates of death due to an AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low PD-L1 expression subgroup than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy.

A somewhat worse toxicity profile is notable for pembrolizumab in the 1L NSCLC indication compared to the  reference  safety  dataset,  which  might  be  partly  attributable  to  a  slightly  longer  exposure  of pembrolizumab and the underlying disease.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

Sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the results from study KEYNOTE042; an international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study investigating KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1 positiv e (TPS ≥ 1%) NSCLC. Particularly, a new warning with regard to a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation of Keytruda monotherapy compared to chemotherapy has been added to the product information.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups..

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

With the current application, the MAH was initially seeking an extension of indication for pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous and non-squamous metastatic and locally advanced NSCLC with a positive PD-L1 score ( TPS ≥1%) and negative for EGFR and ALK gene mutations.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Current guidelines recommend the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), i.e. the prevailing histological subtype ( 85% -90%) of all lung malignancies, as follows:

- -First-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression [Tumou r Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%] with no EGFR or ALK positive tumo ur aberrations
- -Advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumours express PDL1 (TPS ≥1%) and who have received prior platinum-based therapy, and if the tumours express EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on approved therapy before receiving Keytruda.

Moreover, Keytruda is currently authorised as add-on therapy to pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy as first-line option for patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, irrespective of the PD-L1 level  of  expression.  However,  the  combined  therapy  was  proven  to  hold  higher  toxicity  than chemotherapy alone, particularly in elderly patients. This could represent an important limitation to the use of this therapeutic scheme on the basis of patient tolerability, particularly for those with a TPS &lt; 50% for whom chemotherapy would be the only licensed therapy. The same applies to squamous NSCLC, for which pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel has been approved in first-line. The treatment of NSCLC remains a high unmet medical need.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

KEYNOTE-042 is the pivotal trial supporting this application. It is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, controlled  clinical  study  of  pembrolizumab  versus  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  treatment-naïve advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients, including both squamous and non-squamous histology, who present with ALK/EGFR negative disease and a positive PD-L1 score (TPS ≥1%) . The MAH submitted results from the second interim analysis (IA2; date cutoff: 26-Feb-2018). During the procedure, the planned Final Analysis (FA; date cutoff: 04-Sep-2018) was also provided, and an additional extended follow-up served for an updated analysis of OS (cutoff date: 25-Oct-2019).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

In the final analysis, pembrolizumab demonstrated superiority over chemotherapy in the ITT population (TPS ≥ 1%), with a gain in 4 months in OS and HR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.93; p=0.0013; 12 -month and 18month OS rates of 57.8% versus 50.7% and 49.7% versus 37.5%, respectively) .

Within the TPS ≥50% group, OS was in favour of pembrolizumab with a gain of 8 months in median OS (HR= 0.70;95% CI: 0.58, 0.86; p=0.0003) .

Superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was also demonstrated in the TPS ≥ 20% subgroup with a gain of around 5 months in median OS ( HR 0.77;95% CI: 0.65, 0.91; p=0.0012) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Within the subgroup of patients of main interest to the current application (TPS 149% group), no benefit of pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy was demonstrated in terms of OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.77-1.09; p=n.s). HR of PFS in TPS 149% NSCLC was 1.27 favouring chemotherapy.

The number of responders was lower in the pembrolizumab group vs. the chemotherapy group in TPS 149% NSCLC with response rates of 16.5% vs 21.3%.

Within the ITT population (TPS ≥1%) as well as in all subgroup analyses (TPS ≥20% and TPS ≥50%) the OS K-M curves crossed at around month 6, showing a more favourable outcome in the control arm during the first months from treatment initiation while an increased risk of early deaths emerged in the subgroup  of  patients  exposed  to  pembrolizumab.  Inconsistent  results  were  achieved  in  terms  of predictive factors for early death across PD-L1 categories. Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect that a higher number of deaths within 4 months of treatment initiation followed by a long-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy for the already approved indication of pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients with TPS ≥50% .

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

As  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  disease  specific  setting  and  prior  experience  with  pembrolizumab, endocrine (hypothyroidism), skin (rash) and respiratory disorders (dyspnoea, cough and pneumonia) were  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  with  Keytruda (&gt;10%  incidence),  while  gastrointestinal (vomiting, constipation and nausea) and blood disturbances (myelosuppression) were the prevailing AEs in the chemotherapy group (&gt;10% incidence).

A  higher  rate  of  deaths  due  to  AEs  in  the  KN042  was  observed  with  pembrolizumab  arm  (11%) compared to chemotherapy (7.5%). The overall incidence of d eaths due to AEs in this trial was even higher compared with the Reference Safety Dataset (4.1%), and with Study KN -024 (7.8%). The higher rates of death due to an AE in this study might be rather associated with the lack of efficacy in the low PD-L1 expression subgroup than to an increased toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy.

Pembrolizumab showed a more favourable safety profile than chemotherapy following adjustment by exposure time. Overall AEs rate was 83.16 vs 170.33 events/100 person-months and grade 3-5 AE rate of  10.49 vs  21.85 events/100 person-months for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy respectively. SAEs were 6.93 (pembrolizumab) vs 8.05 events/100 person-months (chemotherapy)  while a similar incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was found between treatments (2.25 vs 2.74 events/100 person-months).

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The incidence of overall AEs in the KN-042 pembrolizumab dataset was comparable to the reference dataset and cumulative dataset; however, pneumonia occurred more frequently in the pivotal trial than previously reported (11.9% incidence vs 4.7% and 5.4% in the RDS and CDS, respectively) likely due to  the  underlying  disease  of  the  study  population.  The  slight  increase  of  pneumonitis  in  the  NSCLC compared with the non-NSCLC population and the RDS may be attributed to the higher frequency of patients in the NSCLC population who received prior thoracic radiation (15.8%) compared with the nonNSCLC population (2.8%) and the RSD (8.0%).

Rates of severe and serious cardiac events for pembrolizumab in 1L NSCLC appeared to be increased compared to chemotherapy and compared to the RSD. The higher rate of events in the KEYNOTE-042 pembrolizumab group was driven by increases in the frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs of cardiac

arrest, cardiac failure/cardiac failure acute, myocardial infarction, and, more notably, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade as compared with chemotherapy and the RSD.

However, interpretation of these data is difficult due to the longer exposure to pembrolizumab in the 1L NSCLC  setting,  underlying  disease  progression  and  comorbidities  and  the  small  event  numerosity. Cardiac toxicity will need persistent attention with further evolving safety data (routine pharmacovigilance).

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Study KN-042 showed that the clinical benefit of immunotherapy over chemotherapy within the ITT population (TPS ≥1%) is mainly derived from the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 highly expressing tumours (TPS ≥50%), for whom pembrolizumab is already licensed. Extension of the clinical indication to  include  the  complementary  population  with  PD-L1  score  149%  is  not  currently  supported  by  a demonstrated  clinical  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  chemotherapy  in  this  subcategory  of patients, on the basis of a non-significant advantage in OS of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy, lack of beneficial effect on PFS and superiority of chemotherapy over pembrolizumab in ORR.

Moreover, contradicting results in terms of potential predictive factors for response to treatment were observed  in  the  TPS  149% and TPS≥50% group, not  allowing  any  claim  on  the  ITT  population  of TPS≥1%. The presented data are not considered conclusive and do not alleviate the CHMP concerns on the higher risk of early death in the ITT population of TPS≥1% . This is more relevant for the TPS 149%, that represents a relevant portion of the ITT population (53% and 54% of the study population and total deaths, respectively). Considering the absence of a clear long-term benefit in this group, the uncertainty on the short-term outcome cannot be overcome.

The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy that emerges from KN-042 is consistent with the prior clinical experience. Of note, the comparison with chemotherapy revealed a more favourable outcome achieved with pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients. However, patient subgroups at increased risk of early deaths with pembrolizumab compared to SOC have not been fully characterized so far despite several analyses. In the absence of clinical indicators able to select patients with TPS 149%, for  treatment appropriately, the acceptability of the uncertainties related to the higher risk of early death might be envisaged only in subjects not suitable for chemotherapy or pembrolizumab combination (the latter recently approved in the first line setting of both squamous and non-squamous histology). However, this was not the target population enrolled in KN-042.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

At the present stage, taking into account the observed increases in the risk of early death, particularly marked in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression TPS 149%, and due the lack of identified clinical indicators for the proper selection of patients, the current extension of indication is considered not approvable.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Keytruda monotherapy is considered negative for patients with a PD-L1 TPS 149%. During the procedure, the MAH has decided to no longer pursue the extension of the indication and to only update the PI with relevant safety and efficacy information from study KN-042.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and II           |

Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the results from study KEYNOTE-042; an international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study investigating KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDL1 positive (TPS ≥ 1%) NSCLC . An updated RMP version 28.0 was submitted as part of the application. In addition, the MAH revised the due date for the submission of Annex II study P361 to Q4 2020.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR module \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:
