## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for efgartigimod alfa, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on nausea from clinical trials, and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between efgartigimod alfa and nausea is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing efgartigimod alfa should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for efgartigimod alfa, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  efgartigimod  alfa  is  unchanged  subject  to  the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
