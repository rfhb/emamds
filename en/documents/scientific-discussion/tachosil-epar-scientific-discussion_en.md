## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module  reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval  of TachoSil.  For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

The term fibrin sealant denotes a product containing coagulation factors, to be administered topically in order to produce a fibrin clot. Typical fibrin sealant kits consist of at least two components, which are kept separately until allowed to mix in topical application. One of the components usually contains human fibrinogen, as substrate of the clot. Additionally, it may contain as further active substances human  factor  XIII  to  stabilise  the  generated  fibrin  clot  and/or  inhibitors  of  fibrinolysis.  The  other component  contains  biologically  active  thrombin,  which  will  convert  the  fibrinogen  of  the  first component to fibrin. Fibrin sealant products may also be manufactured from autologous products or combined with  further  components,  such  as  a  collagen  sponge,  or  with  medicinal  products  such  as antibiotics.

The  intended  benefit  of  the  topical  fibrin  sealant  application  is  to  support  local  haemostasis,  or 'gluing' together of surfaces of injured tissues in order to obtain adaption or sealing of surfaces, to support  sutures,  or  to  improve  repair  and  healing.  Fibrin  sealants  have  been  used  to  support  local haemostasis  in  surgical  situations  where  tight  tissue  sealing  is  required  and  the  usage  of  other conventional surgical haemostatic means is not possible. Usage of this type of products is therefore particularly  justified  in  surgical  procedures  involving  parenchymal  organs  such  as  liver  and  lung, and/or where rapid reliable haemostasis is required (i.e. neurosurgery). Thus, the mainstay of fibrin sealant use is in patients who require major surgery or experience major trauma, or require endoscopic procedures to stop bleeding.

The efficacy of fibrin sealant products has to be assessed in studies with objective clinical endpoints. Such studies should be controlled studies, in order to demonstrate that the application of fibrin sealant kits  provides  measurable  benefit  in  comparison  to  the  spontaneous  haemostasis  and  healing  process under standard treatment without fibrin sealant.

TachoSil  consists  of  a  collagen  sponge,  manufactured  from  horse  tendons,  coated  with  human fibrinogen and human thrombin. TachoSil therefore differs from other fibrin sealants described in the Ph. Eur. monograph 'Fibrin sealant kit' (01/2002:0903). The Applicant has previously developed two predecessor products of TachoSil: TachoComb and TachoComb H. Both consist of an equine collagen sponge  coated  with  a  solid  component  of  fibrin  glue.  The  thrombin  of  bovine  origin  in  the  first product, TachoComb, was replaced by human thrombin in TachoComb H in order to address safety concerns  such  as  neutralising  antibody  formation  and  TSE  related  disorders.  Both  TachoComb  and TachoComb H contain the protease inhibitor aprotinin. This component was subsequently removed in the TachoSil formulation, since preclinical development studies conducted by the Applicant demonstrated no clinical effect of aprotinin on haemostasis.

The  mechanism  of  action  of  TachoSil  follows  the  principles  of  physiological  fibrin  clot  formation. Upon contact with a bleeding or leaking wound surface, or triggered by the presence of physiological saline, the coating of the collagen sponge dissolves and the subsequent thrombin-fibrinogen reaction initiates the last step of the coagulation cascade: Fibrinogen is converted by the action of thrombin into fibrin  monomers  which  spontaneously  polymerise  to  a  fibrin  clot.  Thrombin  could  also  activate endogenous factor XIII which covalently crosslinks the fibrin to create a firm and stable network.

TachoSil  is  indicated  for  supportive  treatment  in  surgery  for  improvement  of  haemostasis  where standard techniques are insufficient.

Specific data have not been obtained on the use of this product in neurosurgery, in vascular surgery or in gastrointestinal anastomoses.

Furthermore, the use of TachoSil for tissue sealing is not supported based on the results of the clinical studies undertaken.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Active substance

## Source material

The plasma is used as starting material for the manufacture of human fibrinogen and human thrombin. Information on the plasma is provided in a Plasma Master File (PMF) format according to guideline II/5272/94.  The  PMF  is  submitted  as  an  appendix  to  the  European  Drug  Master  File  (EDMF).  The same PMF applies to antithrombin III used during the production of thrombin and fibrinogen as well as albumin used as a stabiliser of fibrinogen.

The plasma is obtained from centres located in Austria, Germany and USA. All centres are inspected regularly; European centres are under supervision of national authorities, FDA licenses centres in USA and  in  addition  the  German  health  authorities  regularly  inspect  them.  The  quality  and  delivery requirements  comply  with  current  regulations  of  Ph.  Eur.,  US  law,  WHO  recommendations  and recommendations  of  the  Council  of  Europe.  The  plasma  complies  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph 'plasma for fractionation'. Selection and screening of donors is in agreement with current regulations.

2/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Details on epidemiological data are provided in detail. Single donations are tested in accordance with the monograph. All plasma pools are tested in compliance with NfG CPMP/BWP/390/97 (introduction of  HCV NAT). A validated Nucleic Acid Amplification Technique (NAT) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests all pools additionally for HBV DNA and HIV-1 RNA as well as for high titers of parvovirus  B19  DNA.  In  addition,  testing  of  fractionation  pools  for  HAV  genomic  material  is performed provided all contributing donations have been pre-screened at the donor sample pool level. Information  given  for  the  starting  material  plasma  is  detailed  and  shows  compliance  to  all  relevant regulations and documents.

## Active ingredients

TachoSil  drug  product  is  a  combination  of  two  drug  substances,  human  thrombin  and  human fibrinogen, coated on a collagen sponge. Human thrombin and fibrinogen (containing human albumin as a stabiliser) are manufactured by a raw material supplier. Thrombin and albumin are purified from cryo-poor  plasma,  fibrinogen  is  purified  from  cryoprecipitate.    The  fibrinogen  component  complies with  the  European  Pharmacopoeia monograph 'Human fibrinogen'. The albumin complies with the European Pharmacopoeia monograph 'Human Albumin Solution'.  Information on these substances is provided in the form of an EDMF including an open and a closed part.

Freeze-dried Human Antithrombin (AT III) complies with the European Pharmacopoeia monograph 'Human Antithrombin III Concentrate, Freeze-Dried' (Ph. Eur. 01/2002:0878).

Efficient  removal/inactivation  of  enveloped  viruses  during  production  of  fibrinogen,  thrombin,  and albumin,  is  indicated  by  summarised  study  results,  and  additional  complete  reports  from  the  virus clearance studies concerning Human Thrombin, human fibrinogen, Human Albumin 20 % and human antithrombin  are  provided  in  the  Active  Substance  Manufactures  Part  of  the  EDMF  for  Human Fibrinogen (including Human Albumin 20% as stabiliser) and Human Thrombin.

The  pasteurisation is  the  key  step  for  inactivation  of  human  plasma-derived  products.  Virus inactivation  during  pasteurisation  was  demonstrated;  additionally  the  gamma  irradiation  of  the  final product further contributes toward the safety against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses including parvoviruses.

## Purification

## Process validation

The  manufacture  of  human  thrombin  uses  techniques  of  column  chromatography  and  ammonium sulfate  precipitation  and  adsorption  to  calcium  phosphate  to  yield  the  drug  substance.  During  this process prothrombin is converted to thrombin in the presence of high citrate concentrations. The drug substance  is  formulated  and  filled  into  glass  vials  and  lyophilised.  Vials  are  closed  under  nitrogen atmosphere.  The  drug  substance  is  controlled  by  appropriately  validated  methods.  The  purification process has been analysed for reproducibility by characterisation of the purity/impurity profile using state-of-the-art methods. Consistency of the composition of the active ingredient has been established. The consistency of production has been demonstrated in the given specification limits. The container closure system is suitable for this product. Stability data support the stability of thrombin over a shelf life  of  3  years  at  2°C-8°C.  The  thrombin  preparation  used  for  the  manufacture  of  TachoSil  may  be stored maximum for a period of 30 months prior to use. This is justified because the link to the post collection  information  on  donors  and  donations  is  maintained  beyond  the  shelf  life  of  the  finished product.  The  thrombin  preparation  complies  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  'Fibrin  Sealant  Kit' (01/2002:0903).

The  manufacture  of  fibrinogen  starts  from  cryoprecipitate.  The  purification  is  mainly  based  on precipitating  techniques  in  the  presence  of  glycine.  Residual  prothrombin  complex  proteins  are removed by aluminium hydroxide adsorption. The final bulk is prepared by adding human albumin as stabiliser.  After  filling  the  drug  substance  is  lyophilised.  The  drug  substance  is  controlled  by appropriate,  validated  methods.  The  purification  process  has  been  analysed  for  reproducibility  by characterisation  of  the  purity/impurity  profile  using  state-of-the-art  methods.  Consistency  of  the composition of the active ingredient has been established. Batch analysis data support the consistent manufacture of the drug substance within the given specification limits. The container closure system

3/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is suitable for the product. Stability data support a shelf life of 5 years. Nycomed is using only the 2 g presentation  Fibrinogen  used  for  the  manufacture  of  TachoSil  is  batch  released  by  an  Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL). The fibrinogen is stored up to a maximum period of 4 years prior to processing into TachoSil. This is justified because the link to the post collection information on  donors  and  donations  is  maintained  beyond  the  shelf  life  of  the  finished  product  TachoSil.  This fibrinogen component complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph 'Human Fibrinogen'.

## Other ingredients

Albumin is used as excipient (stabiliser) in the manufacture of fibrinogen. The purification follows the Cohn fractionation process. The drug substance is pasteurised two times: first, in a steel tank before filling and second, in the glass container after filling and closing. Consistency of the manufacture and composition of albumin with regard to the purity/impurity profile has been established. The albumin used  for  TachoSil  is  licensed  in  some  EU  member  states.  For  the  manufacture  of  fibrinogen for TachoSil Human Albumin presentations of 50 mL and 100 mL are used.  It is batch released by an OMCL . The albumin is used as stabiliser for the manufacture of fibrinogen up to eight months from the  date  of  release.  Human  Albumin  20%  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  'Human  albumin solution' (Ph. Eur. 01/2002:0255).

During some manufacturing steps of thrombin and fibrinogen, antithrombin III, which itself is a blood product,  is  added,  but  removed  during  the  manufacturing  process.  Only  antithrombin,  which  has undergone  the  Official  Medicines  Control  Laboratory  (OMCL)  Batch  Release  Procedure,  is  used. Details on the manufacture, virus safety and specifications of this product have been provided and are acceptable.

For  collagen  there  exist  no  monograph.  Nycomed  manufactures  the  collagen  from  horse  tendons. Analytical methods have been validated and the consistency of production has been demonstrated by in-process  controls  from  three  batches  as  well  as  batch  release  testing  results  from  these  batches. Specifications  are  acceptable.  The  microbial  purity  has  been  limited  to  100  CFU/45cm 2 before irradiation, and assuming an average weight of 100 mg of one sheet this corresponds to the 1000 cfu/g, which  is  given  in  the  collagen  specification.  The  shelf  life  of  the  collagen  sponge  before  use  in TachoSil is limited to 1 year, which is justified, based on the stability data.

## Specifications

The  specifications  for  the  actives  substances  have  been  set.  Testing  instruction  for  all  analytical methods is provided. The methods are properly validated. The tests are suitable for the control of the drug  substances,  thrombin  and  fibrinogen.  There  are  no  concerns  regarding  the  control  of  the  drug substances for TachoSil.

## Product development and finished product

## Product development

For the manufacture of TachoSil a mixture containing the drug substances thrombin and fibrinogen is coated on collagen sponges using a dripping device. The coated sponges are cut into sheets, dried and transferred  to  a  contract  manufacturer  for  primary  packaging.  After  shipment  to  another  contract manufacturer,  the  medicinal  product  is  sterilised  by  gamma  irradiation.  Nycomed,  Austria  performs final packaging.

## Manufacturing process

The main steps of the TachoSil manufacture are carried out at: Nycomed Austria GmbH, St. Peter Straße 25, A-4020 Linz, Austria.

Primary/Secondary packing is carried out at the following location: Steripac GmbH, Oberreichenbacher Strasse 17, D-75365 Calw Altburg

Sterilisation by gamma irradiation is carried out at the following location:

4/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rüsch  Sterilisation  Service  GmbH,  Willy  Rüsch  Str.  4-10,  D-71394  Kernen-Rommelshausen, Germany.

Flow chart of the whole manufacturing process is provided in the dossier.

## Finished product specification

The  specifications  are  based  on  the  manufacture  of  the  predecessor  products,  TachoComb  and TachoComb H, which is very similar to the production of TachoSil

The  specific  limits  are  considered  to  be  adequate  due  to  the  fact  that  the  active  ingredients  are  of biological origin.

In-process controls in TachoSil manufacture before packaging and irradiation are provided. Release and shelf life specifications for 3 sizes of TachoSil are provided.

## Control of excipients

Collagen sponge: Method validation is provided. Consistency of manufacture is shown by analytical data from 3 production and validation runs and all parameters comply with the specifications. The quality and testing of the excipients conforms to the respective Ph. Eur. Monograph.

## Stability data

There are two crucial steps during the manufacture of TachoComb. These are: first, the stability and suitability  of  the  coating  suspension  for  the  intended  purpose  and  second,  the  stability  of  thrombin during  gamma  irradiation.  Conditions  for  the  coating  solution  must  be  controlled  because  thrombin must  be  kept  inactive  thus  avoiding  the  cleavage  of  fibrinogen  to  fibrin  and  on  the  other  hand conditions must also lead to an appropriate adhesion of the coating mixture. Appropriate development studies have been performed and in-process controls have been implemented which control this critical step. Development studies on the stability and homogeneity of the coating suspension with regard to thrombin  and  fibrinogen  during  the  whole  manufacturing  process  have  been  provided.  These  data justify  an  overage  of  thrombin  at  the  beginning  of  the  process.  Especially  the  influence  of  the sterilisation  procedure  by  gamma  irradiation,  which  is  justified  according  to  Note  for  Guidance CPMP/QWP/054/98 corr, has been analysed. The sterilisation procedure has been validated following the NfG 'The use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products' (III/9109/90).  The analytical methods for the control of the drug product are validated. Results from batch release testing support  the  view  of  a  consistent  manufacture  of  the  product  thus  leading  to  the  conclusion  that  the production  is  under  good  control.  The  specification  limits  of  the  active  substances  fibrinogen  and thrombin have been reconsidered and reflect the current experience of manufacture of TachoSil and the results of batches used for clinical studies. Nycomed has committed to re-consider the data again on the basis of 20 batches. The necessity of broader shelf life specifications is accepted. Stability data for normal size TachoSil at temperatures of 2-8°C, 25°C and 30° are available for a period of 3 years and data at 40°C for a period of 6 months. All results are within specification limits. Additional data are presented for the midi (1 batch) and mini size (3 batches) presentations, which have been stored under the above, mentioned temperature conditions for 6 months. All data are within specifications. A shelf life of 3 years at room temperature should be granted.

Primary  packaging  and  secondary  packaging  have  been  shown  to  be  suitable  for  the  production (irradiation sterilisation) and storage of the product.

## TSE safety

TachoSil consists of human plasma derived proteins coated on a collagen fleece, which are derived form horse tendons. No substances, which fall under the scope of the TSE Guideline, were identified. The supplier of the active raw materials for products has provided declarations to this effect: Human Fibrinogen, Human Albumin, Human Thrombin and Antithrombin.

## Viral safety

The TachoSil production process has been sufficiently investigated on its capacity to remove/inactivate viruses.  It  should  be  further  considered  that  the  final  gamma  irradiation  is  also  effective  against potential contaminants from human plasma proteins (thrombin, fibrinogen, albumin).

5/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is a sufficient safety margin for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV while the risk for HAV and B19V-infection has been minimised by several measures including NAT-screening and virus  inactivation/removal  steps  during  production.  In  addition,  the  gamma  irradiation  of  the  final product further contributes towards the safety against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses including parvoviruses.

Potential viral contaminants from equine tendons used as starting materials of the collagen fleece are subjected to two steps with capacity for virus inactivation: acid treatment and gamma irradiation. Both steps are effective for inactivation of enveloped viruses. The final gamma-irradiation step is effective against  a  broad  range  of  viruses.  Enveloped  and  non-enveloped  viruses  with  large  genomes  are effectively  inactivated  and  a  moderate  inactivation  capacity  (ca.  3  log 10 )  for  inactivation  of  viruses with very small genomes (Parvoviruses) was determined. In conclusion, the virus safety of TachoSil is acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CPMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## GLP

Pivotal toxicity studies with TachoComb H were performed in compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Studies on general pharmacodynamic effects were not performed under GLP conditions since this is not required by EU Guidelines.

## Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

The  mechanism  of  action  of  TachoSil  follows  the  principles  of  physiological  fibrin  clot  formation. Upon  contact  with  a  bleeding  or  leaking  wound  surface,  or  triggered  by  presence  of  physiological saline, the solid components of the coating dissolve and the subsequent fibrinogen-thrombin reaction initiates  the  last  step  of  blood  coagulation.    Fibrinogen  is  converted  into  fibrin  monomers,  which spontaneously polymerise to a fibrin clot, then crosslinked by endogenous factor XIII, to create a firm, mechanically stable network.

The need of aprotinin as a constituent of topical haemostatic and tissue sealing medicinal products was examined  under  normal,  stressful  and  hyperfibrinolytic  conditions.  It  was  concluded  that  TachoSil without aprotinin is an effective haemostatic and tissue sealing product and as effective as TachoComb with aprotinin even under severe hyperfibrinolytic conditions.

Normal condition : A comparison of TachoComb H and TachoSil in sealing spleen- and liver lesions in dogs was performed. Gross observation during surgery and at 48 hours post-surgery and histopathological  figures  showed  no  differences  with  and  without  aprotinin.  There  were  no  rebleedings and both medicinal preparations showed full pharmacological efficacy.

Stressful  conditions :  TachoComb  H  was  compared  to  TachoSil  in  a  pig  spleen  lesion  model  under extremely elevated intrasplenic  pressure.  The  histopathological results  demonstrated  a  slightly  more pronounced degradation of the fibrin clot without aprotinin, however, haemostatic and sealing effects

6/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  maintained.  It  was  concluded  that  TachoSil  is  as  effective  as  TachoComb  H  in  terms  of haemostasis and tissue sealing.

Hyperfibrinolytic  conditions :  TachoSil  and  TachoComb H were studied in a pig pancreatitis model. The medicinal preparations were applied to lesions on pancreas and spleen. After 72 hr, the short term behavior  and  resistance  to  enzymatic  degradation  were  investigated  by  increasing  the  intrasplenic pressure. TachoSil resisted the same increased intra-organ pressure as compared to TachoComb H. The haemostatic and sealing efficacy of TachoSil was not influenced under these severe hyperfibrinolytic conditions.

A second hyperfibrinolytic condition was achieved by local administration of r-tPA before applying TachoSil  or  TachoComb  H  to  cortical  brain  lesions  in  rabbits.  The  haemostatic  and  tissue-sealing efficacy  of  TachoComb  H  and  TachoSil  was  examined  after  topical  administration  to  experimental cortical  brain  lesions  in  rabbits  both  with  and  without  plasminogen  activator.  No  differences  were obtained in efficacy between TachoSil and TachoComb H despite the fact of severe haemorrhage.

Dose range finding studies in rat liver and kidney models were performed using both TachoSil samples containing constant fibrinogen and varying thrombin concentrations and TachoSil samples containing constant thrombin and varying fibrinogen concentrations. The results confirmed the already selected optimal dose of fibrinogen and thrombin in TachoComb and TachoComb H.

Moreover,  evaluation  of  tissue  adherence  of  TachoComb,  TachoComb H  and  TachoSil  to  pleural porcine tissue did not reveal significant differences if the pressure of detachment was determined.

A comparison of TachoComb H and TachoSil was conducted in sealing spleen- and liver lesions in dogs. The obtained results showed no differences between the two medicinal preparations concerning efficacy at gross observation during surgery, at autopsy 48 hours post surgery and histopathology. Not any case of secondary haemorrhage, change in blood count and coagulation tests was revealed.

## Secondary pharmacodynamics

Secondary pharmacodynamics is discussed together with safety pharmacology below.

## Safety pharmacology

Safety  pharmacology  is  based  on  previously  obtained  data  with  TachoComb  containing  equine collagen, human fibrinogen, bovine thrombin and bovine aprotinin. An extensive safety pharmacology programme  was  carried  out  with  TachoComb  in  rats,  guinea  pigs  and  dogs.  The  fleece  was administered into the abdominal cavity via laparotomy (fourfold to fifty fold of the clinical dose) and compared with sham-operated control animals. As control substances Avitene (microfibrillar collagen hemostat)  and  collagen  sponges  (Nycomed)  were  used.  The  main  components  of  the  coating, fibrinogen, bovine thrombin and aprotinin were examined in isolated organ experiments (guinea pig ileum, rat uterus). General pharmacodynamics effects were negligible or mild, if any. No changes were caused  in  general  behavior  (rat),  pain  sensitization  (rat),  spontaneous  motor  activity  (rat),  sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time (rat), induced convulsions (rat), body temperature (rat), respiratory and cardiovascular systems (dog), fibrinolysis/coagulation (rat), and gastrointestinal transit (rat). There was no or only a mild influence on isolated organs not of toxicological relevance for the human patient with TachoComb. Other effects studied without showing an influence of TachoComb include urinary volume  and  electrolyte  excretion  in  rats  and  effects  on  coagulation  and  fibrinolysis  in  rats.  In conclusion,  TachoComb  did  not  show  limiting  side  effects  in  these in  vivo and in  vitro general pharmacodynamic  studies.  In  view  of  the  composition  of  TachoSil  and  given  the  fact  that  the medicinal product is for topical use only, repeated investigations with reference to safety pharmacology are considered of limited value.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  between  topically  administered  TachoSil  and  other  drugs  are essentially  absent.  Nevertheless,  drugs  co-administered  systemically  or  topically  may  affect  the haemostatic  and  tissue  sealing  properties  of  TachoSil.  Previous  studies  with  TachoComb  in  rats pretreated  with  warfarin  or  heparin  showed  that  the  haemostatic  and  tissue  sealing  properties  of TachoComb are preserved even under severe disturbances of the blood clotting. Similarly, the function of TachoSil was preserved if r-tPA was topically co-administered. On the other hand, absorbed active components of TachoSil, fibrinogen and thrombin, might influence the equilibrium between the blood

7/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clotting and fibrinolytic system. However, due to the protein nature of both components, absorption of intact fibrin and thrombin in pharmacologically relevant amounts should not occur.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption- Bioavailability

In  a  study  in  rats  the  decrease  of  labelled  fibrinogen  was  determined  at  the  site  of  application  for TachoComb, i.e. wounded liver. The appearance of radioactivity within the rat liver tissue exposed to 125-I-fibrinogen of TachoComb probably demonstrated absorption of degradation products directly by liver  tissue.  The  radioactivity  concentration  at  the  application  site  decreased  from  39.08  µg  eq.  of fibrinogen/g at 6 hours after administration to 2.56 µg  eq./g at 336  hours  (=14  days)  after administration. The plasma concentration measured 6 hours after application (7.78 µg eq./ml) declined to 0.12-µg eq./ml after 336 hours.

In another study in rats TachoComb was applied to a liver wound and the time until the disappearance of the tested substance was measured; autopsies were performed at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. In a group treated with 0.5 x 0.5 cm/animal, TachoComb had disappeared after 10 - 20 weeks, while it had disappeared after 12 - 16 weeks in a group treated with 1.0 x 1.0 cm/animal and 1.5 x 1.5 cm/animal. Schelling et al. investigated the haemostatic properties of TachoComb in experimental lesions of the liver, spleen and arterial vessels. As part of their study, they reported on the post-operative degradation processes  and  the  changes  in  tissue  structure.  Macroscopically,  only  minimal  tissue  reactions  were found, which were strictly confined to the area that had been covered with TachoComb. By the 14 th postoperative day, histological examination  showed  unspecific  fibrovascular granulation tissue containing fibroblasts, neutrophils, lymphocytes and only a few giant cells, which are indicative of a foreign-body reaction. After four weeks the histological picture showed progressive absorption. While TachoComb was still recognizable, it had been considerably reduced and partly replaced with cell-free connective tissue.

## Distribution

The distribution of labelled 125-I-fibrinogen was investigated after administration of TachoComb via laparotomy to a wound of the liver in male rats. Groups of rats were killed at 6 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7  days  and  14  days  after  treatment.  In  all  tissues,  except  for  the  thyroid  gland,  the  radioactivity concentration  showed  a  maximum  value  at  6  hours  after  application.  At  this  point  in  time, concentrations higher than that measured in the plasma (max 7.78 µg eq./ml) were only found in the thyroid  gland  (97.86  µg  eq./ml)  and  at  the  application  site  of  the  liver.  In  other  tissues,  the concentration  was  similar  to  that  measured  in  the  plasma,  or  lower.  At  336  hours  (14  days)  after application, the concentration in the thyroid gland had decreased to 17% of the maximum value. In the brain,  thymus  gland,  suprarenal  glands  and  skeletal  muscle,  the  concentration  had  sunk  beyond  the detection limit. In the other tissues, the concentration had decreased to 1 - 8% of the maximum value.

## Metabolism

The coated collagen fleece and similar products like fibrin adhesives are physiologically degraded and replaced by tissue via two metabolic mechanisms: (1) The collagen fleece is degraded layer by layer by  absorptive  granulation  tissue  and  converted  into  a  pseudo-capsule  consisting  of  endogenous connective tissue; (2) The lysis of the clotted coating is comparable to that of the endogenous fibrin by fibrinolysis and phagocytosis. The degradation time of the resultant fibrin depends on its volume and on the reactivity and fibrinolytic potency of the surrounding tissue. The activation of the fibrinolytic system, i.e. conversion of the proenzyme plasminogen into plasmin, is a proteolytic process whereby sensitive  bonds  in  the  plasminogen  molecule  are  cleaved.  The in  vivo activation  is  carried  out  by special activators, proteolytic enzymes, which cause specific cleavage in plasminogen, which results in its conversion into the proteolytic enzyme. The fibrin degradation products formed during breakdown are removed like in endogenous degradation, i.e. by elimination via the reticulo-endothelial system. The degradation of TachoComb H via metabolism was examined in dogs after single administration to a liver wound after laparotomy. The animals were observed for 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. After 2 weeks compound remnant was approximately half the size of the TachoComb H. The amount of  compound  remnant  decreased  with  time.  Only  few  spots  were  present  at  week  24.  During degradation the product is replaced by endogenous tissue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In rats administered TachoComb on liver wounds, the time to disappearance was measured during 2-20 weeks. The degradation time of the fleece was between 16 and 20 weeks.

## Excretion

Excretion and recovery of radioactivity was determined after administration of 125-I-fibrinogen with TachoComb. As late as 504 hours (21 days) after application, 89.3% of the dose (radioactivity) had been excreted in the urine, and 3.9% had been excreted in the faeces. At this point of time, 0.4% of the dose was found in the thyroid gland, and 6.4% in the organism.

## Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not performed.

## Toxicology

TachoSil differs from TachoComb H only in lacking the bovine aprotinin. The results obtained with the predecessor products, specifically with TachoComb H, are thus considered relevant.

## Single dose toxicity

No single dose toxicity studies have been performed with TachoSil, but reference is made to studies with  the  predecessor  products.  Four  acute  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  dogs  after insertion of TachoComb H, TachoComb and Tachotop into the peritoneal cavity via laparotomy. One additional safety study was performed with TachoComb H in dogs.

The doses administered i.p.  to  rats  and  dogs  for  evaluation  of  single  dose  toxicity  of  the  medicinal preparations ranged from 10 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg bw (rats) and 5-500 mg/kg (dogs), i.e. about 50 200 times the clinical dose for humans.

No  deaths  occurred.  There  were  no  effects  of  toxicological  importance  on  body  weight,  food consumption,  haematology,  blood  clotting,  blood  chemistry,  and  organ  weights,  which  could  be attributed to TachoComb preparations tested. There were no gross post mortem or histopathological findings of toxicological importance that were considered to be an effect of intraperitoneal insertion of TachoComb preparations.

In dogs , TachoComb H was generally well tolerated up to the highest dose level tested in single dose toxicity study (500 mg/kg). Insertion of the fleeces was followed by observation periods of two weeks for all groups, and of four weeks for additional animals at the 500-mg/kg-body weight dose level and sham-operated control group. There were neither mortalities nor other major toxic findings on body weight,  general  appearance,  clinical  pathology  (haematology,  clinical  chemistry  and  coagulation), autopsy, and histopathology. The non-toxic-effect level of TachoComb H in dogs was 500-mg/kg body weight. In rats , the observed maximum non-lethal dose was 1000 mg/kg.

## Repeat dose toxicity

No  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  with  TachoSil.  TachoSil  is  not  intended  for repeated  applications  over  a  long  period  of  time,  thus  routine  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  do  not seem  to  be  relevant  for  risk  assessment.  Nevertheless,  one  4-week  study  has  been  performed  with TachoComb.  The  fleece  was  inserted  by  laparotomy  into  the  abdominal  cavity  of  rats  5,  50  or 500 mg/kg of once weekly for a total of 4 doses, followed by autopsies 1 or 4 weeks after the last administration. Essentially no adverse effects were seen at doses up to 50 mg/kg. At the 500-mg/kgdose  level,  there  were  slight  effects  on  food  and  water  intake.  Locally,  there  were  dose-related adhesions of the fleeces with the operated site or intraperitoneal organs associated with inflammation. No other effects on general health or on other parameters attributable to the medication were observed in this series of experiments.

## Reproductive and developmental studies/ Genotoxicity/ Carcinogenicity

No  studies  regarding  the  effect  on  reproduction  and  carcinogenicity  have  been  performed  with TachoSil. TachoSil is a medication intended to be used during surgical intervention and will usually be applied  only once per  patient.  Regular  repeated  administration  is  not  expected.  None  of  the components  of  TachoSil  is  known  to  have  an  effect  on  reproduction  or  to  possess  mutagenic  or carcinogenic potential. Furthermore, as the main components of TachoSil are heterologous proteins for animals, no useful results are expected from reproduction or carcinogenicity studies.

9/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Local tolerance

No  separate  studies  on  local  tolerance  were  undertaken  with  TachoSil,  but  local  tolerance  was investigated as part of the pharmacodynamic trials. TachoSil as well as its predecessors were applied to different organs and tissues, i.e. brain, liver and spleen. Specific local reactions were largely absent. Inflammatory-like reactions were observed, but more likely due to mechanical irrigation and were not regarded as toxic.

Further,  one  of  the  predecessors,  i.e.  TachoComb  H,  was  investigated  in  dogs  over  six  months following  a  single  insertion  to  liver  wounds.  The  treated  group  received  a  single  dose  of  2  cm 2 TachoComb H/kg, equivalent to the use of 2-3 patches of TachoComb in a human. Two weeks after surgery,  the  compound  remnant  covered  an  area  of  liver  capsule  approximately  half  the  size  of  the TachoComb H applied originally. Only few spots of compound remnant were present without signs of local irritation 24 weeks after surgery representing the expected degradation of the fleece. There were no signs of local intolerance. There were no histopathological findings attributable to intraperitoneal application of TachoComb H. No parenchymal damage was observed.

## Antigenicity

The risk of possible antigenicity was investigated in rats and guinea pigs with TachoComb, Tachotop, as  well  as  irradiated  and  non-irradiated  single  components  human  fibrinogen,  human  thrombin  and equine collagen. TachoComb was found to be immunogenic in guinea pigs after repeated subcutaneous administrations. However, positive reactions were caused only by human fibrinogen.

## Studies on impurities

Based  on  toxicity  studies  possible  toxicity  of  the  excipient  collagen  can  be  ruled  out.  The  other excipients  (Human  Albumin,  L-Arginine  Monohydrochloride,  Sodium  Chloride,  Trisodium  Citrate, Riboflavine (E 101) to mark the coated side) are well known substances and no incompatibilities are to be expected.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  toxicity  data  of  this  product  and  its  single  components  do  not  provide  any  risk  for  the environment.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The  amount  and  the  quality  of  pharmacodynamic  investigations  are  considered  sufficient,  based  on several studies showing TachoSil to be effective in haemostasis and tissue sealing in different animal models. The efficacy of TachoSil was studied under normal, stressful and hyperfibrinolytic conditions. A number of species including dog, pig and rabbit were studied and a number of organs investigated including spleen, liver, pancreas and brain. The results confirmed that the absence of aprotinin did not affect the therapeutic properties of TachoSil. Of note, one study revealed a slightly more pronounced degradation of the fibrin clot after application of TachoSil  (without aprotinin)  compared  to TachoComb H (with aprotinin). However, this should not influence the efficacy of TachoSil at least not in the time-window of interest.

Investigations concerning secondary and safety pharmacology have not been performed with TachoSil, but the Applicant refers to studies performed with the predecessor TachoComb. These studies revealed no findings of clinical significance. In view of the composition of TachoSil and given that the product is  intended  only  for  topical  use,  investigations  concerning  safety  pharmacology  are  not  considered necessary and should not be repeated with TachoSil.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions between TachoSil and other drugs have only been investigated in one study with r-tPA. However, interactions between topically administered TachoSil and other drugs are not considered as important as they are for other drug substances. Nevertheless, the Applicant will put  particular  focus  on  potential  drug  interactions,  especially  with  other  anticoagulants,  during  the post-marketing activities and as part of a safety surveillance study.

No  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  with  TachoSil,  but  the  Applicant  refers  to  studies performed  with  the  predecessor  TachoComb  and  TachoComb  H.  In  view  of  the  intended  use  of TachoSil,  the  most  relevant  pharmacokinetic  properties  pertain  to  time  course  of  degradation

10/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

('absorption') under in vivo conditions. The disappearance of the implanted medicinal product from the site of application and of their labelled compounds (125-I-fibrinogen) during distinct time periods may  be  considered  as  indicative  of  absorption  and  metabolism. In  vivo investigations  to  study  the disintegration of coated collagen sheets were performed with TachoComb implanted in the peritoneal cavity. The degradation process of bovine thrombin should not differ considerably from that of human thrombin.  Further,  aprotinin  that  is  an  inhibitor  of  proteolytic  enzymes,  is  absent  in  TachoSil. Consequently,  an  accelerated  degradation  may  be  suggested  with  TachoSil  in  comparison  to  other TachoComb  preparations  with  aprotinin.  As  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  remain  comparable between the TachoComb preparations with and without aprotinin (see section on pharmacodynamics) , a potentially faster degradation of TachoSil is of subordinate relevance.

After application of 125-I-(fibrinogen)-TachoComb and absorption from the application site, accumulation of radioactivity in the thyroid gland, but not in other organs and tissues was observed. This finding indicates the well-known problem of in vivo deiodination.

Overall, the limited pharmacokinetic test programme is considered acceptable, as the compounds of TachoSil  are  endogenous  and  thus  are  expected  to  follow  the  usual  pathways  for  metabolism  and excretion  of  proteins.  Degradation  and  replacement  occur  via  two  mechanisms:  the  fibrin  clot  is degraded  partly  by  fibrinolysis  and  partly  by  cellular  phagocytosis,  while  the  collagen  patch  is degraded  layer  by  layer  by  absorptive  granulation  tissue  and  converted  into  a  pseudo-capsule consisting of endogenous connective tissue ('scar'-formation).

Since  the  components  of  TachoSil  are  endogenous  compounds,  it  is  appropriate  that  there  are  no studies  of  protein  binding,  metabolic  pathways  and  possible  interaction  with  the  cytochrome  P450 system.

Both active ingredients are present in the active layer of TachoSil in a dry, solid stage and thrombin reacts  with  fibrinogen  to  form  the  fibrin  clot  immediately  after  moistening  of  TachoSil.  This  was indirectly  proven  with  the  predecessor  product  TachoComb  by  means  of  investigating  the  adhesive strength of TachoComb in a plate adhesion test. TachoSil must be moistened to exert its effects also in clinical  settings  and  it  is  therefore  highly  unlikely  that  enough  excess  thrombin  for systemic uptake would  be  available.  It  can  further  be  expected  that  protease  inhibitors  present  in  the  blood  would inactivate an excess of thrombin. Moreover, during surgical settings, it is unlikely that thrombin would be uptaken against the blood stream. Furthermore, in case of systemic uptake of thrombin the blood coagulation  parameters  would  be  influenced.  Toxicology  studies  performed  with  TachoComb  H revealed no relevant changes in blood coagulation parameters, not even if the product was in contact with a bleeding liver wound. Likewise, no changes in blood coagulation parameters were reported in the  clinical  trials  performed  with  TachoSil  nor  during  the  decade  of  clinical  experience  with approximately 700.000 patients treated with the predecessor products so far. However, the Applicant will  put  particular  focus  on  the  issue  of  thromboembolic  potential  post-marketing  through  the  usual pharmacovigilance reporting tools and as part of a safety surveillance study.

No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  with  TachoSil,  but  the  Applicant  referred  to studies performed with the predecessor products. Five acute toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs with TachoComb H, TachoComb and Tachotop. The presented data indicate a good safety profile of TachoComb preparations in rats and dogs, even after i.p. administration of doses 100-200 fold of those indicated for humans. No repeat dose toxicity studies have been performed with TachoSil. One 4-week study has been performed with TachoComb and essentially no adverse effects were seen at doses up to 50 mg/kg.

Based on the provided data upon the predecessor products and in view of the composition of TachoSil, it is agreed that new acute or repeat toxicity studies are not considered necessary.

No  studies  regarding  the  effect  on  reproduction,  mutagenicity  and  carcinogenicity  have  been performed with TachoSil. Again, such studies are not considered relevant in view of the composition of TachoSil and the intended use, i.e. single application.

Further,  toxicological  investigations  with  reference  to  local  tolerance,  antigenicity  and  studies  on impurities,  did  not  reveal  any  concerns  in  view  of  the  safety  of  TachoSil.  Furthermore,  the  risk  of possible  antigenicity  of  TachoSil  is  considered  low  in  view  of  the  composition  of  TachoSil.  It  is

11/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assumed  that  human  fibrinogen  is  not  antigenic  in  humans  as  it  is  a  homologous  protein.  Adverse reactions  due  to  possible  immunogenic  defence  reactions  should  therefore  essentially  not  occur  in humans,  even  after  repeated  administration  of  TachoSil.  Moreover,  TachoSil  is  not  intended  for regular repeated administration to humans and will usually only be applied once per patient.

Induction of cell-mediated or humoral response by equine collagen could be provoked only by use of an adjuvant. The equine collagen component of TachoSil is not expected to induce an immunological response  under  clinical  conditions.  Nevertheless,  the  Applicant  has  made  a  commitment  to  put particular  focus  on  immunogenicity  during  the  post-marketing  activities  and  as  part  of  a  safety surveillance study.

In conclusion, the assessment of non-clinical data indicates an acceptable safety profile of TachoSil.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## GCP

The Applicant claims that both pivotal TachoSil trials (TC-013-IN and TC-014-IN) and the additional study  (TC-016-IN)  have  been  performed  according  to  the  ethical  principles  of  the  declaration  of Helsinki and in accordance with local requirements as well as in accordance to Good Clinical Practice. The trials have been audited and certified for GCP.

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

## Pharmacokinetics

No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in humans.

In  view  of  the  intended  topical  use  of  the  product,  which  is  largely  independent  from  intrinsic  and extrinsic factors, metabolism - in the sense of absorption or degradation - remains the only relevant pharmacokinetic parameter to be discussed.

Homologous fibrinogen  and  thrombin  as  well  as  the  resulting  fibrin  clot,  but  also  the  sponge  from equine  collagen,  are  expected  to  be  metabolised  in  the  same  way  as  the  patient's  own  respective compounds.  Indeed, animal studies with the predecessor products of TachoSil confirmed that i) the clotted  coating  is  metabolised  by  fibrinolysis  and  phagocytosis  and  ii)  the  collagen  sponge  is progressively degraded layer by layer by absorptive granulation tissue and converted into a pseudocapsule consisting of connective tissue.  Depending on the size of the experimental wound covered as well as the organ system and the species of animals investigated, only few remnants of the collagen sponge were present after approximately 24 weeks, without any signs of irritation (see Non-Clinical part).

## Pharmacodynamics

No specific primary or secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in humans . In  a  series  of  preclinical  investigations  in  animals,  TachoSil  demonstrated  haemostatic  efficacy, adhesion to the wound surface and airtight sealing properties, in a variety of different models in vivo and ex vivo (see Non-Clinical  part).  However,  in  these  studies,  pharmacodynamics  was  not investigated directly but via indirect parameters such as time to haemostasis. To directly investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of TachoSil, the ability, the speed and the stability of clot and tissue sealing  should  have  been  studied.  However,  there  are  no  methods  or  parameters  available  for  such studies  and  information  on  human  pharmacodynamics was therefore gathered as part of the clinical studies.

## Mechanism of action

The  mechanism  of  action  of  TachoSil  follows  the  principles  of  physiological  fibrin  clot  formation. Upon  contact  with  a  bleeding  or  leaking  wound  surface,  or  triggered  by  presence  of  physiological saline, the solid components of the coating dissolve and the subsequent fibrinogen-thrombin reaction initiates  the  last  step  of  blood  coagulation.    Fibrinogen  is  converted  into  fibrin  monomers,  which spontaneously polymerise to a fibrin clot, then crosslinked by endogenous factor XIII, to create a firm, mechanically stable network.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were not undertaken.

## Clinical efficacy

## Introduction

The clinical efficacy of TachoSil in supporting haemostasis and tissue sealing was investigated in two pivotal trials.  One study was conducted in sealing of air leakages during lung surgery (TC-013-IN) and  one  in  patients  undergoing  partial  liver  resection  (TC-014-IN).  No  clinical  experience  with TachoSil was available prior to conducting these trials. The Applicant submits five clinical trials with TachoComb H as additional supportive evidence. These are Phase III studies PHTC 009, PHTC 008, PHTC  007,  PHTC  006  and  TC-011  AU.  These  studies  are  submitted  in  view  of  the  pre-clinical evidence of similarity between the final product and its predecessor.

Due  to  the  nature  of  the  product  both  pivotal  trials  with  TachoSil  and  similarly  all  the  trials  with TachoComb  H  were  conducted  in  an  open,  randomised,  prospective  and  multicentre  fashion.  The choice  of  active  comparator  in  the  pivotal  studies  TC-013  IN  and  TC-014  IN  as  well  as  in  the additional  study  TC-016  IN  (and  in  all  but  one  of  the  supportive  studies)  is  standard  surgical management with sutures and argon beamer, respectively. Except for one trial with TachoComb H, i.e. a study on lymphatic sealing (TC-011-AU), a patient population being equally eligible for treatment with TachoSil/ TachoComb H and surgical standard techniques was selected and then randomised to receive  either  the  test  product  or  standard  therapy.    In  contrast,  the  lymph  study  investigated  the efficacy of TachoComb H in addition to surgical standard compared to surgical standard alone, in a randomised, open manner. Patient populations were selected by surgical condition and randomised to receive  either  TachoSil  or  treatment  according  to  surgical  standard,  with  the  aim  of  demonstrating superiority of TachoSil over active standard therapy.

The  patients  enrolled  in  all  the  trials  submitted  were  above  18  years  of  age,  no  upper  limits  were defined for the two pivotal trials, and for study PHTC 009. Trials PHTC 006/008 and TC-011-AU did not include patient beyond the age of 85 and 80 years, respectively.

The  Applicant  is  currently  conducting  a  further  confirmatory  clinical  trial  with  TachoSil  in  renal surgery, TC-015-IN. The results of this study will be communicated to the CPMP as a post-marketing commitment.

The amount of product used in the trials was individualised by the treating surgeon with the exception of supportive study TC-011 AU. All of the TachoSil and TachoComb H sponges provided for clinical trials measured 9.5 cm x 4.8 cm and were 0.5 cm thick.

## Dose response studies

No designated dose response studies were performed with TachoSil. According to the Applicant, the dosing recommendation is based on preclinical findings and on clinical experience with both TachoSil and  predecessor  products,  and  this  development  reflects  the  nature  of  the  product.  However,  the sponges used in all clinical trials measured 9.5cm x 4.8 cm and were 0.5 cm thick, no further specific clinical data are made available in the dossier in support of the proposed dosage and administration.

The optimal dose is predefined as an amount of Fibrinogen and Thrombin per cm 2 of TachoSil fleece material. However, the amount of TachoSil used by the surgeon cannot be pre-defined as the amount (dose) needed depends on a case by case clinical judgement by the surgeon, primarily based on the size of area needing treatment by TachoSil, i.e. as defined in protocols: TachoSil must cover any resection site at least 1 cm beyond its margins. If several patches are required these must overlap.

Main studies (Studies TC-013-IN, TC-014-IN, TC-016-IN)

## Study TC-013-IN

An open, randomised, prospective, multicenter, parallel-group phase III trial to compare the efficacy and safety of TachoSil vs standard surgical treatment (SST) in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer and requiring treatment for air leakage after primary stapling.

## Methods

## Study participants

Patients  aged  18  or  above  with  air  leakage  grade  0,  1  or  2  who  were  planned  to  undergo  elective lobectomy with or without lymphadenectomy for lung cancer with antero- or postero-lateral incision were to be included in this trial.

## Treatments

TachoSil was applied to all resection surfaces, specifically the hilar area, regardless of the degree of air leakage present at randomisation. The number of TachoSil sponges to be applied was not prespecified in  the  trial  protocol  but  depended  on  the  patient's  individual  size  of  the  bleeding  or  leaking  wound surface, which had to be covered in total.

In the comparator group, patients presenting without air leakage received either no further treatment or additional suturing at the hilar part of the resection area, according to the discretion of the surgeon, whereas  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  air  leakage  were  subjected  to  standard  management  with sutures, according to the routine of the centre.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

- Incidence of air leakage 42-54 hours after surgery

Air leakage was assessed on day 1, the day of the operation, using the water submersion test (grades 0-

3). Two assessments were made, immediately after surgery (baseline) and after the first use of study treatment. Patients with grade 3 immediately after the operation had continued surgery until grade 0, 1

- or 2 was obtained.

On days 2-9 air leakage was assessed once daily using the Pleur-Evac (grades 0-7). In both tests low grades represent less air leakage with grade 0 signifying no leakage.

Secondary endpoints:

- Reduction of intra-operative air leakage intensity after the first test treatment;
- Intensity and duration of post-operative air leakage;
- Duration of post-operative chest tube drainage up to 9 days after surgery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

It  was  planned  that  200  patients  should  be  recruited  into  the  study  in  a  1:1  randomisation.  The randomisation was stratified according to the grade of air leakage at baseline, grade 0 or grade 1-2. However,  recruitment  was  halted  when  only  189  patients  were  recruited.  The  reason  given  for  the early stopping was a slower than expected recruitment rate. It was calculated that with 200 patients the expected power was 87%, whereas 189 patients still gave 85% so it was considered acceptable to stop recruitment.

## Statistical methods

The ITT population was defined as the primary population. This is appropriate as the aim of the trial is to establish superiority over the comparator. The population was defined as all patients randomised and given treatment. This is not an appropriate definition for the ITT population in an open-label trial, and all randomised patients should have been included, but as there were no patients who were randomised and not treated this is not an issue.

|                    | TachoSil   | Standard   |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| ITT population     | 96         | 93         |

| Baseline grade 1-2 | 46 (48%)   | 43 (46%)   |

There was a large baseline imbalance in the area of the treatment site. The large amount of missing data  for  this  variable  in  the  standard  group  is  surprising  and  may  have  something  to  do  with  the apparent imbalance. Alternatively there may have been a problem with the randomisation in this open study, the result being that more severe patients were more likely to receive the active treatment. This is  possible as patients were not randomised until after the baseline air leakage had been assessed. If this were the case the implications for interpreting the date from the study would be serious.

| Standard |  71 | 8.04 (7.91)   |     6.28 |

All statistical tests were to be performed using a type I error (two-sided) of 0.05. With respect to the primary endpoint, the incidence of air leakage 48 ± 6 hours after completion of surgery, both treatment groups were compared by means of a two-sided Fisher test. This was done for the ITT as well as the PP  population.  Additional  analyses  by  means  of  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  tests  were  performed  to account for the centres and strata at randomisation respectively.

Duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  and  post-operative  chest  tube  drainage  respectively  was compared between both treatment groups using a log-rank test stratified for centre.

In general, missing values were not substituted except for the AUC of the post-operative intensity of air leakage where missing values were replaced by zero.

Demographics,  pulmonary  function,  operation  and  test  treatment  variables  as  well  as  chest  X-ray findings were tabulated, only.

## Study TC-014-IN

An open, randomised, prospective, multicenter, parallel group phase III trial to compare haemostatic efficacy and safety of TachoSil and argon beamer in patients undergoing liver resection.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Hospitalised  patients  undergoing  elective  liver  resection  for  any  medical  reason  (mainly  hepatic malignancies) were eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  trial.  At  least  segmental  resection,  following  either anatomical demarkation lines or non-anatomical resections, had to be performed, and minor (oozing) or moderate haemorrhage persisting after primary surgical haemostatic intervention had to be present prior to randomisation of the patient to either TachoSil or argon beamer treatment.

15/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients presenting with pulsating arterial haemorrhage and/or major venous bleeding did not qualify and  were  subjected  to  additional  conventional  haemostatic  measures  before  becoming  eligible  for inclusion into this trial.

The objectives of this  trial  were  to  compare  haemostatic  efficacy  and  safety  of TachoSil  and  argon beamer treatment in patients undergoing liver resection.

## Treatments

Primary  haemostasis  of  major  vessels  was  performed  as  usual  and  recorded,  e.g.  sutures,  ligations, clips.  The  hepatic  blood  flow  occlusion  was  unclamped  and  hemorrhage  checked  -  if  minor  or moderate bleeding remained, patients were randomised to either TachoSil or argon beamer treatment. The number of TachoSil sponges to be applied was not prespecified in the trial protocol but depended on the patients' individual size of the bleeding wound surface, which had to be covered in total. Argon beamer treatment was applied to patients according to the routine of the surgical centre (i.e. once or twice with different duration times). The argon beamer was chosen as the comparator because it is an often used standard treatment to achieve haemostasis and tissue sealing in liver resections. TachoSil or argon beamer was applied to all resection sites. If there was more than one resection site, the largest site was measured and assessed for time to haemostasis. This was called the target site.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

- Time (min) to intra-operative haemostasis after application of TachoSil or argon beamer.

Counting began when the test treatment was first applied. Haemostasis was considered to have been achieved when there was no visible bleeding from the target site. Presence or absence of haemostasis was assessed at 3, 4 and 5 minutes after the first treatment had begun. If haemostasis had not been achieved by 5 minutes the treatment was repeated.

## Secondary endpoints:

-  Proportion of patients with haemostasis 10 min after initiation of test treatment without additional haemostatic measures;
-  Volume  of  drainage  fluid  at  day  1  and  days  1+2  after  surgery  and  haemoglobin  concentration  of drainage fluid at day 1 and day 1+2;
- Total post-operative duration of drainage.

## Sample size

It was planned that 140 patients should be recruited into the study in a 1:1 randomisation. However as in trial 013 recruitment was halted early, in this case when only 118 patients had been recruited (an additional 3 patients still ended up being randomised into the trial). Again the reasons given were a slower than expected recruitment rate and a calculation that there was not much power to be gained by waiting for  the  additional  patients.  It  was  calculated  that  with  140  patients  the  expected  power  was 95.3%, whereas 118 patients still gave 92.1%.

As stated for trial 013 the early termination of recruitment is problematic for an open-label study as it would be possible to monitor the results as the trial  progresses  and  terminate  recruitment  after  it  is known that positive results have been achieved.

## Statistical methods

The ITT population was defined as the primary population. This is appropriate as the aim of the trial is to establish superiority over the comparator. The population was defined as all patients randomised and given treatment. As there were no patients who were randomised and not treated this is satisfactory. Fewer patients completed the trial in the TachoSil group. The reason for this was the greater number of deaths in the TachoSil group. If this is a real finding it would be extremely concerning.

| Completed the trial    | 53 (90%)   | 59 (95%) |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As in study 013 there was a difference between treatment groups in the area of the target wound, with the larger area being found in the TachoSil group. The comments made in the assessment of study 013 regarding a possible breakdown in the randomisation apply here, and are strengthened by the finding being  repeated  in  both  studies.  This  could  create  problems  for  the  interpretation  of  the  data.  If  the randomisation  has  not  worked  the  trial  is  not  comparing  randomised  groups  and  many  of  the assumptions underlying the statistical analyses are no longer valid.

## Area of target wound (cm 2 )

|          |   N | Mean (SD)   |   Median |
|----------|-----|-------------|----------|
| TachoSil |  59 | 84 (57)     |       71 |
| Argon    |  63 | 65 (41)     |       57 |

All statistical tests were to be performed using a type I error (two-sided) of 0.05.

A  log-rank  test  was  used  to  compare  time  to  haemostasis  between  both  treatment  groups.  As  time recordings were made only at the time points 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 minutes after start of treatment a haemostasis time less than 3 min was set to 3 min, a haemostasis time of 6 or 7 minutes was set to 8 min in the analysis. If haemostasis was obtained after 10 minutes, the observation was censored at 10 min.  In  addition  an  explorative  parametric  survival  analysis  accounting  for  interval  censoring  was performed.

The proportion of patients with haemostasis after 10 minutes treatment were compared by means of Fisher's test and, in addition by means of a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test accounting for centres.

Both treatment groups were compared with respect to volume of drainage on days 1 and 2 by means on an  ANOVA.  The  same  method  of  analysis  was  used  for  the  comparison  of  treatment  groups  with respect to haemoglobin on both days.

A log-rank test was used to compare duration of drainage between both treatment groups.

The above-mentioned parameter as well as all other parameter was described by means of descriptive statistics.

## Study TC-016 IN

In order to address the statistical concerns raised with study TC-014-IN, the Applicant provided the clinical study report of a second liver resection trial (TC-016-IN). Out of 149 screened patients a total of 119 patients (60 TachoSil, 59 argon beamer) at 10 centres were randomised in this open label study. Following liver resection and primary haemostasis randomisation was done by a centralised telephone randomisation system. Both treatment groups were balanced with respect to baseline demographic and general anamnestic data. With respect to the surgical data a slight imbalance in favour of the TachoSil group was to be found with respect to the number of segments resected (median: TachoSil - 2, argon beamer - 3) and the area of the target wound (median: TachoSil - 47.1 cm 2 , argon beamer - 63.4 cm 2 ).

18/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analyses of secondary parameters such as intra- and post-operative air leakage intensity and volume of post-operative chest tube drainage overall did not reveal statistically relevant differences between the treatment  groups.  The  results  showed  positive  trends  and  did  reach  significance  in  the  sub-group analysis of the grade 1-2 strata.

The  advantages  seen  in  secondary  parameters  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  baseline  air  leakage grade  1-2  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  as  the  primary  analysis  does  not  reveal  a  significant advantage for TachoSil (thus any conclusion based on secondary analyses are questionable per se.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to haemostasis in minutes. The primary analysis was to be performed  using  the  log-rank  test.  The  primary  analysis  provides  strong  evidence  that  the  time  to haemostasis is reduced by the use of TachoSil as opposed to Argon, and hence that TachoSil improves the control of bleeding (subject to the methodological problems identified).

The  secondary  endpoints  produced  slightly  contradictory  findings.  A  positive  finding  is  that  the haemoglobin  content  of  the  drainage  fluid  is  significantly  lower  for  TachoSil,  however  a  negative finding is that the duration of drainage is significantly longer.

## Study TC-016-IN

With regard to the primary endpoint of efficacy, time to haemostasis, the results are summarised below:

| Time to haemostasis (min), ITT   | TachoSil N=60   | Argon beamer N=59   |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mean (SD)                        | 3.6 (0.9)       | 5.0 (3.6)           |
| Median                           | 3.0             | 3.0                 |
| Range                            | 3-8             | 3-23                |

Life tables' estimates for time to haemostasis, depicting the fraction of subjects still bleeding at a given time,  are  shown  in  the  figure  below.  The  log-rank  test  for  difference  between  treatment  in  time  to haemostasis  was  statistical  significant  in  favour  of  TachoComb  S  compared  to  argon  beamer (p=0.0018, ITT population):

None of the secondary endpoints gave significant results. Total median drain volume was lower (0.6 vs.  1.1  litres)  in  the  TachoSil  compared  to  the  argon  beamer  treatment  group.  Median  duration  of drainage was comparable (5 days) in both groups. Haemoglobin as well as bilirubin concentrations of drainage fluid did not differ significantly between treatment groups.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No studies in special populations were undertaken.

## Supportive studies

The  Applicant  provided 5 additional  supportive  studies  with  TachoComb  H  and  TachoComb respectively.

## Liver Resection (PHTC 009):

Study PHTC 009 was conducted in 279 patients in liver resection surgery with the aim of evaluating the  efficacy  and  safety  of  TachoComb  H  (n=86)  versus  argon  beamer  (n=97)  and  no  immediate secondary treatment (n=96). The patient population was virtually identical to the one in pivotal study TC-014-IN. However the study design was different from the pivotal study, as it consisted of three groups and the primary endpoint was efficacy rating by the surgeon, based on the need for additional surgical  measures  to  obtain  haemostasis.  Secondary  variables  were  blood  loss,  operation  time  and overall rating of usefulness.

The treatment was found to be effective in 91% of patients in the TachoComb H group, in 79% of the argon  beamer  and  in  49%  of  the  observation  group.  The  blood  loss  could  not  be  calculated,  no significant  differences  were  seen  between  groups  in  the  operation  time.  The  treatment  was  rated  as easy to use and effective by the investigators.

## Pulmonary Surgery (PHTC 007):

Study  PHTC  007  was  planned  to  recruit  150  patients  with  pulmonary  air  leakage,  it  was  however terminated after inclusion of patient 92 due to concerns on centres' GCP compliance. The evaluation of  the  results  shows  TachoComb  H  more  effective  than  surgical  standard  (p=0.0006)  with  efficacy scores of 8.5±2.1 and 6.2±3.5 respectively, but for the above reason the results can only be considered as additional evidence.

## Lymphatic Sealing (TC-011-AU):

61 patients were enrolled and treated with either TachoComb H (30) or surgical standard alone (31). All patients were female undergoing axillary lymph nodes dissection due to breast cancer. One whole patch was applied along the thoracic nerve and half patch over the nerveless boundle as it enters the arm. Two different batches of product were used.

21/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary efficacy was the duration of drainage, secondary efficacy included post-operative hospitalisation,  time  to  drainage  removal,  drainage  volume,  local  infection/inflammation,  seroma formation.

TC-011  AU  failed  to  demonstrate  any  clinical  benefit  of  TachoComb  H  over  standard  wound management (control) as no statistical  or  clinical  differences  were  found  in  any  of  the  primary  and secondary variables. No additional dosing information was obtained from this trial.

## Suture hole bleeding (PHTC 006 and PHTC 008):

PHTC  008  trial  was  terminated  after  25  patients  had  been  enrolled,  as  it  was  unlikely  to  yield additional information. For this reason the data from study 008 were not subject to statistical analysis. The results of trial PHTC 006, including 30 patients for each treatment group, was as follows: median time to haemostasis 240 seconds (range 180-900) for TachoComb H versus 390 seconds (1801500)  in  the  control  group.  The  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  with  and  without  co-variates (including  indication,  surgical  centre  and  number  of  suture  holes)  and  resulted  in  favour  of  Tacho Comb H in both analyses (p=0.0085 and p=0.0034, respectively). The surgical centre however was a significant prognostic factor for time to haemostasis (0.0034). The incidence of local infections was lower in the TachoComb H group (3% vs. 13%). No statistically or clinically significant differences were found with respect to the other secondary endpoints between treatments.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The Applicant has not performed any pharmacokinetic studies in humans, but refers to animal studies that have been performed with the predecessor products of TachoSil. The rationale for this approach is comprehensive.  For  topically  used  fibrin  sealant  and  in  particular  for  TachoSil,  pharmacokinetic studies are not as important as they are for pharmaceutical products where certain blood levels of the active compound have to be achieved and sometimes also to be prevented. TachoSil will be applied topically  and  its  efficacy  can  be  shown  by  demonstrating  that  the  clot  and/or  the  tissue  sealing  is stable. This parameter, however, has been investigated in clinical studies. Concerning the metabolism of the compounds, the information gained from the animal studies, i.e. slow degradation of clot and sponge over several weeks, is considered sufficient and given the practical difficulties, do not need to be re-evaluated in humans.

No pharmacodynamic studies in humans have been performed and the Applicant refers to the animal studies undertaken. However, in these studies, pharmacodynamics was not investigated directly but via indirect parameters such as time to haemostasis. To investigate pharmacodynamics directly, the speed and the stability of clot formation and/or tissue sealing would need to be measured. There are currently no  established  methods  to  study  these  pharmacodynamic  end-points.  Thus,  information  on  human pharmacodynamics will be gained by results of the clinical studies only.

The  effect  of  TachoSil  is  based  on  the  well-known  physiological  process  of  the  final  steps  of  the coagulation cascade and therefore the lack of specific data in man is considered to be reasonable. The Applicant  has  conducted  animal  studies  to  characterise  TachoSil's  pharmacological  properties. According to this information, the fibrin clot is metabolised as the endogenous fibrin and the collagen sponge persist until its degradation (completed within ~24 weeks). It is however unclear whether the product's  mechanism  of  action  also  involves  physical/mechanical  interaction  of  the  solid  collagen matrix with the wound surface or is only attributable to the claimed activation of the product's clotting components.

In order to demonstrate efficacy of TachoSil, the company initially submitted two pivotal studies with TachoSil,  i.e.  TC-013-IN,  lung  surgery  study,  and  TC-014-IN,  liver  surgery  study.  Furthermore, supportive  studies  with  the  predecessor  products,  i.e.  TachoComb  and  TachoComb  H,  have  been provided. Since the predecessor products do differ in the composition of biological active compounds, these studies cannot replace studies with TachoSil.

The lung trial (TC-013-IN) failed to reach its primary objective, which was to demonstrate superiority of  TachoSil over conventional surgical means. Whereas the trial on liver surgery (TC-014-IN) gave statistically  significant  results  in  favour  of  TachoSil  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint  (time  to

22/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haemostasis) and haemoglobin concentration of drainage (secondary endpoint). The other secondary endpoints  (volume  and  duration  of  drainage)  showed  instead  an  advantage  for  the  argon  beamer  in liver  resection.  However,  while  showing  results  in  favour  of  TachoSil  with  respect  to  the  primary endpoint, the liver surgery trial (TC-014-IN) has several faults resulting ultimately in lack of internal consistency and affecting its clinical significance. Furthermore, the proportion of deaths in this study appears to be higher in the TachoSil than in the control group, therefore rising safety concerns. Additionally, no comparison has been made with any of the fibrin sealant products currently licensed in the EU.

Overall, the results in favour of TachoSil were questionable due to methodological problems of both clinical studies. The trials were performed in an open manner and either no or insufficient provisions were  taken  to  minimise  the  possibility  of  bias  or  the  provisions  undertaken  were  insufficiently described. Further, both studies were prematurely terminated. The reasons provided are either not in accordance with the study protocols or the information provided is insufficient in order to comprehend the decisions leading to study termination. With reference to study TC-014-IN, it cannot be excluded that the study was terminated due to the favourable outcome at the time of termination.

Study TC-013-IN, the lung trial, showed many positive trends in favour of the active treatment but overall the study was negative. Neither a statistically significant nor a clinically relevant advantage in favour of TachoSil has been shown.  One of the secondary endpoints was significant, but there was an imbalance in baseline air leakage and the positive result was not robust when a sensitivity analysisignoring baseline was performed.

The imbalances seen in area of treatment site and baseline air leakage, with the most serious cases more likely to be entered into the TachoSil group, might indicate the possibility of the randomisation having failed, which would have serious implications for the interpretability of the data.

In  the  liver  trial,  study  TC-014-IN,  the  primary  endpoint  produced  highly  statistically  significant results  in  favour  of  TachoSil.  In  addition  one  of  the  secondary  endpoints  produced  positive  results. However  when  considering  this  study  we  must  also  consider  certain  factors  which  complicate  the interpretation. The recruitment was stopped early, which could bias the results of an open-label trial. There was an imbalance in the area of the target wound, with the larger wounds tending to be on the TachoSil group. If there were a problem with the randomisation this would have serious implications for the interpretability of the data. Other issues are the higher proportion of deaths and the finding of longer duration of drainage in the TachoSil group.

To  overcome  these  problems  and  establish  the  efficacy  findings  a  new  trial  on  liver  surgery  was performed by the applicant (TC-016-IN), which is methodological acceptable. Many deficiencies of previous trials have been corrected in this study, making it more robust.

With respect to the primary efficacy parameter, the results of study TC-016-IN are in line with those of study TC-014-IN. There is a statistically significant improvement in time to haemostasis for TachoSil patients when compared to argon beamer in both trials (TC-014-IN mean time to haemostasis 3.9 min vs. 6.3 min (median: 3.0 min vs. 4.0 min),p = 0.0007;  TC-016-IN mean time to haemostasis 3.6 min vs. 5.0 min (median: 3.0 min in both groups), p = 0.0018). The effects on the secondary endpoints in study TC-016-IN are only minor and not statistically significant. The prolongation of total duration of drainage as observed in study TC-014-IN was not confirmed in study TC-016-IN (the median duration of drainage being 5 days in both treatment groups).

However,  the  interpretation  of  the  positive  findings  on  time  to  haemostasis  in  study  TC-016-IN  is aggravated by observed imbalances with respect to surgical data. The number of resected segments is lower in the TachoSil patients than in argon beamer treated patients (median: 2 vs. 3). The same holds for the area of target wound (47.1 cm 2 vs. 63.4 cm 2 ). However, taking into account corresponding data provided  by  TC-014-IN,  where  these  imbalances  were  the  opposite  way  (median  resected  elements TachoSil/Beamer  4  vs.  3  and  wound  area  71  vs.  57  cm 2 )  and  the  positive  findings  regarding  the efficacy in haemostasis treatment in both studies, the efficacy conclusion is considered to be positive for TachoSil.

It is acknowledged that blinding during the surgery is nearly impossible, thus for assessment of intraoperative effects an open trial might be the only possibility. The measures to avoid bias described by

23/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the applicant are quite vague and with respect to the observations made in study TC-013-IN and TC014-IN it seems that these measures were not effective in all cases. Fortunately the new trial TC-016IN has less bias problems and allows us to have more confidence in the results of study TC-014-IN.

The  results  from  study  TC-016-IN  are  significantly  in  favour  of  the  primary  endpoint  'time  to haemostasis' and safety is comparable to the control procedure 'Argon Beamer', which is widely used and  is  a  valid  comparator.  As  the  secondary  end-points  did  not  show  statistically  significant superiority,  TachoSil  cannot  be  accepted  as  superior  to  Argon  Beamer  on  the  basis  of  current information. Furthermore, the use of TachoSil for tissue sealing is not supported based on the results of the two pivotal studies mentioned above.

TachoSil  is  indicated  for  supportive  treatment  in  surgery  for  improvement  of  haemostasis  where standard techniques are insufficient. Specific data have not been obtained on the use of this product in neurosurgery, in vascular surgery or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. The use of TachoSil is restricted to experienced surgeons.

There is currently insufficient information to recommend use in paediatric patients and this has been reflected in the SPC. The Applicant has committed to perform a prospective post-marketing study on the safety and efficacy of TachoSil in children post-marketing. Furthermore, the Applicant is currently conducting  a  further  confirmatory  clinical  trial  with  TachoSil  in  renal  surgery,  TC-015-IN.  The outcome of this clinical study will be communicated to CPMP as a post-marketing commitment.

## Clinical safety

Clinical safety of TachoSil was assessed in the two pivotal trials TC-013 IN and TC-014 IN and the additional  study,  TC-016-IN,  contributing  to  both  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  product.    In  addition, supportive clinical safety data gathered in studies with the predecessor product, TachoComb H, which differs from TachoSil mainly by additional presence of bovine aprotinin, were presented.

## Patient exposure

|              | Patients enrolled                               | Patients exposed To TachoSil   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Open studies | 189 (TC-013-IN) 121 (TC-014-IN) 119 (TC-016-IN) | n = 96 n = 59 n = 60           |

The following table summarises the number of patients exposed to different dosages of TachoSil in the two pivotal trials, TC-013-IN and TC-014-IN.

| Exposure to TachoSil   | TC-013-IN (n-96)   | TC-013-IN (n-96)   | TC-014IN (n=59)   | TC-014IN (n=59)   |

Similarly,  the  applicants  summarises  the  number  of  patients  exposed  to  the  drug  in  studies  with TachoComb H:

| TachoComb H trial   |   Patients exposed |   Amount of sponges |   Average per patient |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| PHTC 006            |                 30 |                28.5 |                  0.95 |

The maximum dose of TachoSil or TachoComb H given to a single individual in clinical trials was six and seven sponges, respectively.

## Adverse events

## TC-013-IN:

In total, 81 (43%) of the patients experienced one or more adverse events during the trial. The number of patients reporting at least one adverse event in each treatment group was: TachoSil group 39 (41%) and standard treatment group 42 (45%). The most frequent adverse event was surgical site reactions (12 and 20 events in TachoSil and standard group, respectively), fever (3 and 10 events in TachoSil and  standard  group,  respectively),  and  atrial  fibrillation  (2  and  8  events,  respectively).  Only  one adverse event, i.e. one case of emphysema, was considered related to TachoSil.

## TC-014-IN:

In  total,  50  (42%)  of  the  patients  experienced  97  adverse  events  during  the  trial.  The  numbers  of patients reporting at least one adverse event in each treatment group were, TachoSil group 26 (44%) and argon beamer group 24 (39%). The most frequent adverse events were abscess (7 events), fever (7 events), post-operative wound infection (6 events), pneumonia (6 events) and gall bladder disorder (6 events). The numbers of adverse events were equally distributed between treatment groups for the total number of events as well as for causality. Four adverse events were considered possibly related to test treatment:  Post-operative  haemorrhage  (TachoSil),  anaemia  (TachoSil),  abscess  and  pleural  effusion (argon beamer). Seventeen adverse events were rated as severe in the TachoSil group compared to 4 in the argon beamer group.

## TC-016-IN:

Adverse events were reported for 25/60 (42%) of the TachoSil patients and 28/59 (48%) patients in the argon beamer group. In general, adverse events were equally distributed between treatment groups for the total number of adverse events, severity and causality. The most frequently reported adverse events were  urinary  tract  infection,  myocardial  infarction,  ascites,  wound  infection,  pneumonia,  pleural effusion  and  pulmonary  failure  that  are  well  known  complications  to  intra-abdominal  surgery,  e.g. liver resection. There was no significant difference in the distribution of these adverse events between the  two  treatment  groups.  Of  the  92  adverse  events  reported,  none  were reported probable and four were considered possibly related to test treatment. The four possibly related adverse events were liver abscess  and  postoperative  abscess  for  TachoSil  and  intra-abdominal  haematoma  and  infection  for argon beamer.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## TC-013-IN:

Sixteen  patients  (8.5%)  experienced  one  or  more  serious  adverse  events  following  randomisation, resulting  in  19  events  and  16  individual  SAE  reports.  Additionally,  2  events  occurred  in  2  patients before  randomisation.  There  were  13  serious  adverse  events  in  10  TachoSil  treated  patients,  and  6 patients in the standard group experienced a total of 6 serious adverse events. The only serious adverse event considered related to test treatment (TachoSil) was emphysema. One patient died during screening after a haemorrhage.

25/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## TC-014-IN:

Of the 121 patients, 21 (17.5%) had a total of 37 serious adverse events, 23 events in 14 TachoSil patients and 14 events in 7 argon beamer patients. The serious adverse events were all related to the underlying medical condition or to the long-lasting and complicated surgical procedures, except for 2 events that were possible related to TachoSil (post-operative haemorrhage) and argon beamer (abscess and pleural effusion), respectively.

Eight patients died during the trial, 6 TachoSil patients and 2 argon beamer patients. The deaths were all  related  to  complications  of  surgery  (5  patients)  or  to  the  underlying  illness  (3  patients),  and  the uneven distribution between treatment groups seems incidental.

## TC-016-IN:

Serious adverse events were to be observed in 10/60 (17%) TachoSil patients and 14/59 (24%) argon beamer subjects. No treatment specific pattern of adverse events became obvious.

Six  subjects  died  during  the  trial,  two  TachoSil  and  four  argon  beamer  subjects.  No  death  was considered treatment related.

## Supportive trials:

In all supportive trials conducted with TachoComb H, 44 serious adverse events were reported from 32 patients of the TachoComb H groups (total n=211) and 54 serious adverse events from 43 patients in the comparator groups (total n=318).  None of the serious AEs were considered by the Applicant as probably or possibly related to study treatment, except for those reported in liver study PHTC 009. Six adverse events, classified as probably/possibly related, were reported in this study (two in each treatment group: TachoComb H, argon beamer, and observation).  In the TachoComb H group, one female 75 y.o. Patient developed biliary fistula and underwent surgical revision.  The patient recovered completed from the event. The other patient from this group, a 30 y.o. female, experienced persistent bleeding from the resection area, which required re-operation, this patient recovered completely.

## Common Adverse Events

## TC-013-IN:

The table below displays the number and type of the most frequent adverse events in the two treatment groups:

| Number of patients   |   Total N=189 |   TachoSil group N=96 |   Standard treatment N=93 |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|                      |            32 |                    12 |                        20 |
| Fever                |            13 |                     3 |                        10 |
| Artrial fibrillation |            10 |                     2 |                         8 |

None of the serious surgical site reactions was considered related to test treatment. One of the AEs in trial TC-013-IN is pulmonary embolism; this has been classified as non-related.

Two events  in  the  non-serious  surgical  site  reaction  in  the  TachoSil  group  and  three  events  in  the standard treatment group were probably or possibly related but all recovered without sequelae.

## TC-014-IN:

The number and distribution of the most frequent adverse events:

| Adverse event           |   Total N=120 |   TachoSil group N=59 |   Standard treatment N=61 |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Abscess                 |             8 |                     5 |                         3 |
| Fever                   |             7 |                     3 |                         4 |
| Gall bladder disorder   |             6 |                     4 |                         2 |
| Pneumonia               |             6 |                     2 |                         4 |
| Postop. Wound infection |             6 |                     4 |                         2 |

26/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nine  of  these  events  were  classified  as  serious:  five  abscess  formations  (2  in  patients  receiving TachoSil and 3 in standard treatment) as well as three events of gall bladder disorder (2 with TachoSil and 1 standard treatment) and one case of postoperative wound infection in the TachoSil group. One  case  of  postoperative  haemorrhage  was  reported  in  the  TachoSil  treatment  group.  This  was considered  by  the  company  as  possibly  related  to  TachoSil  treatment  (attributed  by  either  lack  of efficacy or to a bleeding vessel in the wound area covered by TachoSil). One case was fatal, all other patients mentioned above recovered without sequelae.

## Supportive studies:

In the TachoComb H studies the following adverse events were recorded most frequently:

| Adverse event             | TachoComb H N=211   | Standard treatment N=318   |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Fever                     | 25 (11.8%)          | 30 (9.6%)                  |
| Impaired wound healing    | 17 (8.1%)           | 21 (6.7%)                  |
| Postoperative haemorrhage | 12 (5.7%)           | 15 (4.7%)                  |

## Laboratory findings

## TC-013-IN:

Clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  values  developed  with  the  same  frequency  in  the  two groups, i.e. 6 patients in the TachoComb S group and 5 patients in standard group. At screening most of  the  laboratory  values  were  already  abnormal  (83%  in  TachoComb  S  group  and  80%  in  standard group). On discharge over half of the subjects had improved since screening (57% in TachoComb S group and 60% in standard group).

## TC-014-IN:

Clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  values  were  reported  for  14  TachoSil  patients  and  for  4 argon  beamer  patients.  All  clinically  abnormal  laboratory  values  were  either  already  present  at screening or were caused by the surgical procedures performed or by the underlying liver disease of the patient.

In all trials with TachoSil or TachoComb H, changes in laboratory parameters were recorded during study. In general, the most marked changes in haematological parameters were postoperative decreases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte counts, which often persisted until discharge. Coagulation parameters also changed in all trials, with: i) prothrombin time decreasing intraoperatively, ii) activated partial thromboplasting time increasing intraoperatively and at 24 hours postoperatively,  and  iii)  thrombin  time  markedly  increasing  intraoperatively.  All  the  changes  were usually  transient.  According  to  the  company,  these  changes  reflect  the  intraoperative  anticoagulant therapy. However, the type of anticoagulant used in the trial is not discussed.

## Thrombotic events

## Myocardial infarctions:

In  the  liver  trial  TC-016-IN,  3.4%  of  subjects  developed  myocardial  infarction.  There  was  no significant  difference  in  the  number  of  subjects  developing  myocardial  infarction  between  the treatment groups with 4 subjects in the TachoSil group and 0 subjects in the argon beamer group. It should be noted that there is little statistical power of this analysis because of the small numbers, so the conclusion should be cautious. However, it is likewise statistically problematic to conclude any higher incidence  of  myocardial  infarction  in  the  TachoSil  group  compared  to  control  patients.  The  higher number of events in the TachoSil thus seems incidental. All four TachoSil subjects had several risk factors  for  development  of  myocardial  infarction.  Two  of  the  subjects  died  due  to  myocardial infarction and 2 subjects recovered. All myocardial infarctions were considered not related to TachoSil by the investigator.

27/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  lung  trial  TC-013-IN,  no  myocardial  infarctions  were  reported.  In  the  liver  trial  TC-014-IN, myocardial infarction developed in 1 subject in the TachoSil group and in none subjects in the argon beamer group. The myocardial infarction was considered not related to TachoSil by the investigator.

Furthermore,  a  statistical  analysis  (Fisher´s  Exact  Test)  based  on  the  pooled  data  of  all  TachoSil studies  shows  no  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  of  thrombotic  events  in  general  between TachoSil and the comparator (p=0.75) (see table 1).

Number of subjects with thrombotic events in TC-013-IN, TC-014-IN and TC-016-IN

| Adverse Event (LLT)     |   TachoSil |   Comparator |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Cerebral infarction     |          0 |            1 |
| Myocardial infarction   |          5 |            0 |
| Pulmonary embolus       |          1 |            1 |
| Thrombosis              |          0 |            1 |
| Thrombosis arterial leg |          0 |            1 |
| Total                   |          6 |            4 |

In conclusion, myocardial infarction is a known complication to major surgery and the incidence of myocardial infarction in liver  study  TC-016-IN  is in line with data from the literature. The slightly higher incidence of myocardial infarction in the TachoSil group seems incidental, which is supported by data from the lung trial TC-013-IN, the liver trial TC-014-IN, and pooled data on thrombotic events from all three TachoSil studies.

## Pleural effusion:

In  liver  trial  TC-016-IN,  pleural  effusion  developed  in  2.5%  of  subjects.  There  was  no  significant difference (P= 0.24) in the number of pleural effusion between the two treatment groups with 3 pleural effusions (1 serious and 2 non-serious) in the TachoSil group and none in the argon beamer group. All three  subjects  had  risk  factors  for  pleural  effusion.  All  three  events  were  considered  not  related  to TachoSil by the investigator.

The  slightly  higher  number  of  pleural  effusions  in  the  TachoSil  group  seems  incidental,  which  is supported by the findings in TC-013-IN and TC-014-IN. Pleural effusion was not reported in lung trial TC-013-IN. In liver trial TC-014-IN, pleural effusion developed in 3.3% of the subjects and was equal distributed  between  the  two  treatment  groups  with  2  pleural  effusions  (both  non-serious  and  not related) in the TachoSil group and 2 pleural effusions (1 non-serious and not related, and 1 serious and possible related) in the argon beamer group.

## Respiratory insufficiency:

In  liver  trial  TC-016-IN,  3.4%  of  subjects  developed  respiratory  insufficiency.  There  was  no significant difference (P=0.62) in the number of respiratory insufficiency between the treatment groups with 3 events (all serious) in the TachoSil group and 1 event (non-serious) in the argon beamer group. The TachoSil subjects had several risk factors for development of respiratory insufficiency. None of these three events were related to TachoSil. All three subjects were treated with mechanical ventilation and recovered.

The slightly higher number of respiratory insufficiency in the TachoSil group seems incidental, which is  supported  by  the  findings in  TC-013-IN and TC-014-IN. In the lung trial TC-013-IN, respiratory insufficiency  developed  in  0.5%  of  the  subjects  and  was  equal  distributed  between  the  treatment groups with 1 respiratory insufficiency in the TachoSil group and 0 in the standard treatment group. The respiratory insufficiency in the TachoSil subject was non-serious and the subject had several risk factors for respiratory insufficiency, e.g. a medical history of heart failure and malignant neoplasm of bronchus  and  lung,  major  chest  operation,  and  general  anaesthesia.  The  event  was  considered  not related to TachoSil by the investigator. Respiratory insufficiency was not reported in the liver trial TC014-IN.

## Safety in special populations

No studies were undertaken for TachoSil in any special populations.

## Immunological events

Monitoring  by  coagulation  screening  tests  was  included  in  the  clinical  trials,  however  no  specific immunological monitoring was performed. There is no clinical trial experience on the repeated use of TachoSil and TachoComb H.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No designated studies on interactions with other drugs have been performed.

## Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data is available for TachoSil.

The Applicant  provided  supportive  data  concerning  the  postmarketing  experience  gathered  with  the TachoSil  predecessor  products,  i.e.  TachoComb  (containing  bovine  thrombin,  bovine  aprotinin)  and TachoComb  H  (containing  human  thrombin,  and  bovine  aprotinin).  For  all  three  products  the pharmaceutical preparation, the presentation of the product and the intended clinical use are essentially identical.

TachoComb is approved in 40 countries worldwide and the first marketing authorisation was granted on 5 September 1991 in Austria. Assuming an average use of one to two coated sponges per surgical procedure per patient, the amount of sponges sold thus corresponds to a patient exposure of well over 250,000 patients, since TachoComb was first introduced.

In total, 79 adverse drug reactions have been reported for TachoComb. The relatively most frequent events reported were fever or pyrexia (body as a whole - general disorders) and post-operative wound infections,  including  abscess  formation  (resistance  mechanism  disorders).    These  adverse  events, together  with  isolated  cases  of  ileus,  abdominal  adhesion,  pneumothorax,  pulmonary  infection, mediastinitis  or  cardiac  tamponade,  are  rather  common  after  surgical  interventions  and  thus  not considered to raise any safety concerns with respect to the product.  Nevertheless, a causal relationship between fever and eosinophilia as signs of hypersensitivity and the use of TachoComb could not be excluded.

In  TachoComb  H,  the  second  predecessor  product  of  TachoSil,  one  of  the  active  components  of TachoComb, bovine thrombin, was replaced by a biologically equivalent amount of human thrombin. Following  marketing  authorisation  on  12  February  2001,  the  product  was  launched  in  Germany. During the following period with an estimated minimum exposure of 30,000 patients, there were no reports of adverse drug reaction associated with TachoComb H.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety  data  submitted  in  support  of  TachoSil  generally  reflect  the  type  of  post-operative complications related  to  the  surgical  settings  in  which  the  trials  were  conducted.  The  data  obtained from the pivotal clinical trials with TachoSil raised concerns for the safety profile of TachoSil, which to a large extent have been addressed and clarified by the Applicant, for instance by the undertaking of study TC-016-IN. Data obtained from the clinical trials with TachoSil are in line with corresponding literature and there does not seem to be a significant pattern of organ involvement for adverse events.

Based on data from the two pivotal TachoSil studies, in total three adverse events were considered related to the treatment with TachoSil. However, all three adverse events, i.e. emphysema after lung surgery, post-operative haemorrhage and one case of anaemia after liver resection surgery, are more probably  consequences  of  the  surgical  procedures  rather  than  effects  of  application  of  TachoSil. Consequently, the observed AE's do not have any consequences for the SPC.

Data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoComb/TachoComb H also did not reveal safety concerns. However, this information is considered to be at most supportive as the predecessors do have a different composition compared to TachoSil.

Study  TC-IN-014  raised  major  concerns  since  more  deaths  occurred  among  the  TachoSil  treated patients. From the data presented one might get the impression of bias in the patient population in the sense that TachoSil patients might have been at a higher risk of complications.

Despite of recent advances in liver surgery, morbidity and mortality rates after major liver resection are still  significant.  In  the  literature,  mortality rates between 1.2% and 13.4% have been reported in different liver resection studies. In the liver resection study, TC-014-IN, an overall mortality rate of 6.6% was observed, which is within the range of mortality rates reported in the literature. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths between the two treatment groups with six deaths in the TachoSil group and two deaths in the argon beamer group. However, the study was not powered to pick up differences of such magnitude. None of the deaths were considered by either the Investigator  or  the  Sponsor  to  be  related  to  the  trial  product.  The  unequal  distribution  of  deaths between treatment groups seems incidental, which is supported by the equal distribution of deaths in the  recently  completed  liver  resection  trial,  TC-016-IN.  While  the  deaths  were  higher  in  TachoSil group in the previous liver surgery trial (6/59 vs. 2/62 on argon beamer), it was lower in the new trial TC-016-IN (2/60 vs 4/59 on argon beamer).

In the liver trial TC-014-IN, a total of 37 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 21 patients: 23 SAEs in 14 TachoSil patients and 14 SAEs in 7 argon beamer patients. There was no significant difference on the number of SAEs in the two treatment groups. The most frequently reported SAEs were abscess, fever, post-operative wound infection, pneumonia, and gall bladder disorder, and they were  equally  distributed  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  Of  the  37  SAEs  reported  in  the  two treatment  groups,  only  one  SAE  (post-operative  haemorrhage)  in  the  TachoSil  group  and  2  SAEs (abscess and pleural effusion) in the argon beamer group were considered by both Investigator and the Applicant to be possibly related to trial product.

Of the 92 adverse events reported in study TC-016-IN, none were reported probable and four were considered  possibly  related  to  test  treatment.  The  four  possibly  related  adverse  events  were  liver abscess  and  postoperative  abscess  for  TachoSil  and  intra-abdominal  haematoma  and  infection  for argon beamer.

The data obtained from these two clinical trials with TachoSil are in line with corresponding literature and  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a  significant  pattern  of  organ  involvement.  In  any  case,  because  of methodological  flaws  safety  assessment  in  TC-14-IN  is  difficult  and  causality  assessments  by investigators  could  be  biased,  as  this  was  an  open-label  study.  The  composition  of  TachoSil,  i.e. human  fibrinogen  and  thrombin  coated  on  equine  collagen,  does  not  raise  concerns  that  extensive resorption of the compounds will take place, which could result in undesired systemical side effects. Topical application would not normally be expected to have extensive systemic exposure. However, for all of the six deaths in the TachoSil arm, a contribution from the test agent cannot be confidently excluded. Whether some or all of these deaths had an element of thrombotic complication is difficult to evaluate at present.

Furthermore, in study TC-016-IN, there was a definite increase in myocardial infarctions (4 vs 0) and pulmonary  events  such  as  pleural  effusion  and  respiratory  insufficiency  in  the  TachoSil  group  as compared  to  the  controls.  However,  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  and  might  be incidental.

The  combined  incidence  in  the  liver  trial  TC-016-IN  of  cardio-respiratory  complications,  including MI, pleural effusion and respiratory insufficiency was 10 for TachoSil group and 1 for argon Beamer. This  is  significant  from  a  clinical  perspective  because  of  the  potentially  serious  consequences  of cardio-respiratory  complications  in  post-operative  period.  Pulmonary  embolus  is  known  to  cause respiratory insufficiency and/or pleural effusion and it is generally recognised that clinical diagnosis is unreliable.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  TachoSil,  which  is  primarily  one  of  inducing  thrombus formation, could be mechanistically related to the above complications. However, it is considered that it would not be appropriate to add a warning to the TachoSil SPC regarding a potentially increased risk of thromboembolic events since the data currently available are difficult to interpret and no causality link has been established. As recommended by CPMP guidance, the Applicant will monitor thrombotic events and antibodies as part of continued safety surveillance. It is considered appropriate to further investigate possible increased risk of thrombotic events through the usual pharmacovigilance tools and a post-marketing safety monitoring study. In line with the core SPC for fibrin sealants, Sections 4.4 and  4.8  of  the  SPC  warn  about  thromboembolic  complications  if  the  preparation  is  unintentionally applied intravascularly.

30/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is also some concern regarding a potential interaction with concomitantly used anticoagulants such as heparin. However, from theoretical considerations an interaction with heparin is not considered likely. It is not considered appropriate to add a warning to the TachoSil SPC regarding an interaction with concomitantly used anticoagulants, as there was no evidence for this at present.  This question will be further investigated as part of the post-marketing safety monitoring study.

The theoretical risks of hypersensitivity and/or allergic reactions are considered sufficiently addressed in the SPC and will also be studied as part of the safety monitoring study.

Lack  of  data  in  children  is  mentioned  in  the  SPC  and  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  perform  a prospective post-marketing study on the safety and efficacy of TachoSil in children.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

In summary the quality of the product is considered satisfactory on the basis of the submitted data. The manufacture of TachoSil as well as the manufacture of the drug substances human fibrinogen and human thrombin appears to yield consistent drug substances as well as drug product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  Applicant  provided  several  studies  showing  TachoSil  to  be  effective  in  haemostasis  and  tissue sealing in different animal models. Investigations concerning secondary and safety pharmacology have not been performed with TachoSil, but the Applicant refers to studies performed with the predecessor TachoComb, which is considered acceptable in view of the product characteristics and the intended use.

Pharmacokinetic studies with the predecessors TachoComb and TachoComb H, have shown that after local application a slow degradation (absorption) and replacement process take place over weeks.

Degradation  and  replacement  occur  via  two  mechanisms:  the  fibrin  clot  is  degraded  partly  by fibrinolysis and partly by cellular phagocytosis, while the collagen patch is degraded layer by layer by absorptive granulation tissue and converted into a pseudo-capsule consisting of endogenous connective tissue ('scar'-formation).

No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  with  TachoSil,  but  again  studies  have  been performed with the predecessor products. Five acute toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs with TachoComb H, TachoComb and Tachotop. The presented data indicate a good safety profile of TachoComb preparations in rats and dogs, even after i.p. administration of doses 100-200 fold of those indicated for humans. No repeat dose toxicity studies have been performed with TachoSil. One 4-week study has been performed with TachoComb. Essentially no adverse effects were seen at doses up to 50 mg/kg.

No  studies  regarding  the  effect  on  reproduction  and  carcinogenicity  have  been  performed  with TachoSil. Again, such studies are not considered relevant in view of the composition of TachoSil and the intended use. Further, toxicological investigations, i.e. local tolerance, antigenicity and studies on impurities,  did  not  reveal  any  concern  in  view  of  the  safety  of  TachoSil.  Furthermore,  the  risk  of possible antigenicity of TachoSil is considered low in view of the composition of TachoSil, the fact that TachoSil is not intended for regular repeated administration and the information as provided. In  conclusion,  the  evaluation  of  the  pharmacological  and  toxicological  data  reveals  no  concerns  in view of the safety profile of TachoSil.

## Efficacy

The Applicant has not performed any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies in humans, but refers  to  animal  studies  performed  with  the  predecessor  products.  The  rationale  for  this  approach  is comprehensive given the product characteristics. The mechanism of action is based on the well-known physiological  process  of  the  final  steps  of  the  coagulation  cascade.  The  pharmacodynamics  of

31/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TachoSil was not investigated directly in animal studies but via indirect parameters such as time to haemostasis. It is considered that information on human pharmacodynamics can be gained by results of the clinical studies only.

Concerning the metabolism of compounds, the information gained from the animal studies, i.e. slow degradation  of  clot  and  sponge  over  several  weeks,  is  considered  sufficient  and  given  the  practical difficulties, may not need to be re-evaluated in humans.

The  Applicant  initially  submitted  two  pivotal  clinical  trials  in  support  of  TachoSil's  efficacy  and safety: one conducted in pulmonary surgery and the one in liver surgery. However, the lung trial (TC013-IN) failed to reach its primary objective. The trial on liver surgery (TC-014-IN) while showing results  in  favour  of  TachoSil  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint  has  several  faults  resulting ultimately  in  lack  of  internal  consistency  and  affecting  its  clinical  significance.  Furthermore,  the proportion  of  deaths  in  this  study  appears  to  be  higher  in  the  TachoSil  than  in  the  control  group, therefore rising safety concerns.

To overcome these safety and methodological concerns and emphasising the efficacy findings a new trial on liver surgery was performed by the Applicant (TC-016-IN). Results are significantly in favour of  the  primary  endpoint  'time  to  haemostasis'  and  safety  is  comparable  to  the  control  procedure 'Argon Beamer', which is widely used and is a valid comparator. As the secondary end-points did not show statistically significant superiority, TachoSil cannot be accepted as superior to Argon Beamer on the basis of current information. This study is considered methodologically acceptable.

There is currently insufficient information to recommend use in paediatric patients and this has been reflected in the SPC. The Applicant has committed to perform a prospective post-marketing study on the safety and efficacy of TachoSil in children post-marketing. Furthermore, the Applicant is currently conducting  a  further  confirmatory  clinical  trial  with  TachoSil  in  renal  surgery,  TC-015-IN.  The outcome of this clinical study will be communicated to CPMP as a post-marketing commitment.

TachoSil  is  indicated  for  supportive  treatment  in  surgery  for  improvement  of  haemostasis  where standard techniques are insufficient. Specific data have not been obtained on the use of this product in neirosurgery, in vascular surgery or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. Furthermore, the use of TachoSil for tissue sealing is not supported based on the clinical studies performed.

The use of TachoSil is restricted to experienced surgeons.

## Safety

Data obtained from the clinical trials with TachoSil are in line with corresponding literature and there does not seem to be a significant pattern of organ involvement for adverse events. Data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoComb/ TachoComb H also did not reveal safety concerns. However,  this  information  is  considered  to  be  of  minor  importance  as  the  predecessors  do  have  a different composition compared to TachoSil.

Nevertheless  there  are  still  some  concerns  about  the  potential  for  thromboembolic  events,  which cannot be totally excluded at present time due to the nature of the available data.

The  Applicant  will  therefore  undertake  a  prospective,  safety  monitoring  study  as  a  post-marketing commitment with particular focus on thromboembolic events, immunological reactions and potential interactions. The  theoretical risks of hypersensitivity and/or allergic reactions are considered sufficiently  addressed  in  the  SPC.  The  lack  of  data  in  children  is  mentioned  in  the  SPC  and  the Applicant will perform a prospective post-marketing study on safety and efficacy in children.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Following  the  review  of  the  submitted  documentation,  the  written  responses  provided  and  the  final SPC  and  letter  of  undertaking,  the  CPMP  agreed  that  TachoSil  has  shown  efficacy  as  supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis where standard techniques are insufficient, that may be clinically relevant and that allows a conclusion on an acceptable benefit/risk. TachoSil has demonstrated  a  comparable  benefit/risk  in  comparison  with  an  established  treatment  in  the  clinical

32/33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies in accordance with the requirements of the CPMP  NfG  on  fibrin  sealant products (CPMP/BPWG/1089/00).

In  order  to  collect  additional  data,  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  undertake  a  prospective,  safety monitoring  study  post-marketing,  with  particular  focus  on  thromboembolic  events,  immunological reactions  and  potential  interactions.  Furthermore,  a  prospective  comparative trial will be undertaken post-marketing to assess the haemostatic efficacy and safety of TachoSil in children. The Applicant will also report the results of a currently ongoing prospective, randomised, controlled trial in patients undergoing renal surgery in accordance with agreed timeframes for review by the Committee.

## Recommendation

'Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of TachoSil in the supportive treatment in surgery for improvement  of  haemostasis  where  standard  techniques  are  insufficient  (see  5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
