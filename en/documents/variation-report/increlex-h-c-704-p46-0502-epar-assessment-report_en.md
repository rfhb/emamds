| Currently approved Indication(s)                 | For the long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulin- like growth factor 1 deficiency (Primary IGFD). Severe Primary IGFD is defined by: - height standard deviation score -3.0 and - basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age and gender and - GH sufficiency. - Exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, or chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti- inflammatory steroids. Severe Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected to respond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. It is recommended to confirm the diagnosis by conducting an IGF-1 generation test. |

## Introduction

On  18 th December  2012  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (MS316)  for  Increlex,  in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Increlex and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH states that Study MS316 is a stand alone study.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study MS316; Recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rhGH) and Recombinant Human Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF-1) Combination Therapy in Children with Short Stature Associated with IGF-1 Deficiency:  A  Six-year,  Randomized,  Multi-Center,  Open-Label,  Parallel-Group,  Active  Treatment Controlled, Dose Selection Trial.

The study was carried out as a 'proof of principle'- study in children with short stature associated with less severe IGF-1 deficiency than in the current EU-SPC for Increlex and in combination with rhGH. Hence  the  studied  indication  and  treatment  regimen  (combination  with  rhGH)  are  outside  of  the current EU-indication for mecasermin.

The FDA has approved rhGH treatment in the pediatric population with idiopathic short stature in 2003. Similar approval does not exist in Europe.

## 2. Clinical study

Study  MS316:  Recombinant  Human  Growth  Hormone  (rhGH)  and  Recombinant  Human Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF-1) Combination Therapy in Children with Short Stature Associated  with  IGF-1  Deficiency:  A  Six-year,  Randomized,  Multi-Center,  Open-Label, Parallel-Group, Active Treatment Controlled, Dose Selection Trial

## Description

Low IGF-1 is common to both growth hormone (GH) resistance and growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and may be the best marker of a defect of the GH:IGF-1 axis. The rationale for testing the combination of  hGH  and  rhIGF-1  therapy  for  short  stature  children  with  low  IGF-1  was  based  on  evidence  of independent and complementary actions of GH and IGF-1 to promote growth and the prevalence of GH insensitivity  and  low  serum  IGF-1  levels  in  children  with  idiopathic  short  stature.  The  combination therapy could also potentially limit adverse effects related to the use of each agent individually. The MS316 study examined the potential superiority of combination hGH + rhIGF-1 compared to hGH alone in GH sufficient children with short stature and low IGF-1 (defined as SDS≤-1).

## Methods

- Objective(s)

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of three combinations of rhGH and rhIGF-1 compared to that of rhGH alone in the treatment of short stature associated with IGFD.

The secondary objectives of the study were to:

- o Assess changes that occur in serum concentrations of GH and IGF-1 and their binding proteins

o Assess  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  GH  and  IGF-1  during  chronic administration

- o Assess the rate of skeletal maturation during treatment
- o Explore total changes in body mass index (BMI)
- Study design

This was a phase II, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active treatment controlled, dose selection study conducted at 27 centers in the US.

Screening took place to achieve a targeted population of 100 prepubertal children, aged 5 years or older, with short stature associated with low IGF-1 and normal stimulated GH response.

A  parallel-group  design  was  selected  since  childhood  growth-spurts  are  unpredictable  in  timing  and duration;  a  cross-over  design  may  not  have  been  able  to  distinguish  between  growth  spurts  and treatment response within the broad age range of this population.

Similarly, a long-term study was required to effectively capture any differences in growth rate between subjects.

The randomization was stratified according to whether the subject's age was ≤9 years, and whether the subject's IGF-1 SDS was ≤-2, at screening. This procedure was intended to minimize any possible interference attributable to inter-subject variability in these factors.

The  planned  treatment  duration  for  each  subject  was  6  years  (increased  from  3  years  by  protocol Amendment 2, which was finalized after all subjects had completed 1 year of).

However, the study was  prematurely  terminated by  the  Sponsor  after  the  last  subject  attended  14 visits (completed Year 3) due to strategic reasons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study drugs were administered by daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections, commenced by the Investigator at Day 1, Visit 2. Subsequent injections were made at home by the subject or the subjects' parents and/or guardians, following appropriate training.

Monitoring for adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications began at Visit 2.

Subject Diaries were used to record any missed administrations and preserve study drug accountability. Assessment for efficacy and safety were performed at the study visits.

## Premature Termination of the Study

In  2011,  Ipsen  undertook  a  complete  review  of  its  commercial  and  development  strategies.  The decision was made to focus resources on other areas which led to a change in the strategy for the growth franchise. As a result, the MS316 study was ended at the time the last subject completed 14 visits.

Inclusion criteria were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they met the following criteria:

- Parents  or  legally  authorized  representatives  had  provided  signed  informed  consent  before  any study-related activities;
- IGF-1 SDS of ≤-1.0 for age and gender at Visit 1;
- Short stature, as defined by a height SDS of ≤-2.0 for age and gender at Visit 1;
- Chronological age ≥5 years;
- Bone age ≤11 years in boys and ≤9 years in girls (bone age exam was scheduled to be taken within 6 months of Screening);

· GH sufficiency, defined as a maximal stimulated GH response of ≥10 ng/mL (The GH stimulation test was scheduled at Visit 1 to occur prior to Visit 2, unless the Medical Monitor approved the use of a prior stimulation test result to satisfy this requirement);

· Prepubertal  status:  Girls  were  at  less  than  Tanner  stage  2  breast  development  and  boys  had testicular volume ≤3 mL, as measured by the standardized orchidometer (Prader type). The onset of pubic hair development, up to and including Tanner stage 2, was permitted at study entry;

· Adequate nutrition as evidenced by a BMI greater than or equal to the 5 th  percentile for age and gender.

Exclusion criteria were as follows:

Subjects were excluded from entering the study for the following reasons:

- Severe Primary IGFD (height and IGF-1 SDS ≤-3, and stimulated GH response ≥10 ng/mL a Visit 1);
- Any previous therapeutic use of IGF-1, GH, gonadotropin agonists (e.g., Lupron®), sex steroids or aromatase  inhibitors.  A  short-term  (7  days  or  fewer)  exposure  to  GH  for  a  diagnostic  test  was permitted;
- Known or suspected allergy to rhGH, rhIGF-1 or a constituent of their formulations;
- Chronic illness, including: diabetes mellitus; inborn errors of metabolism; osteoor chondrodystrophies; disease of the genitourinary, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system. The Medical Monitor was to be consulted on the inclusion of subjects whose chronic condition or medication for such condition did not, in the opinion of the investigator, potentially increase risk to the subject or to the integrity of the study;
- Chromosomal aneuploidy (for example, Down syndrome or other trisomies, Turner syndrome);
- Syndromes with known predisposition to develop malignant tumors (for example, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi syndrome);
- Prior bone marrow transplantation;
- Any  named  syndrome  known  to  be  associated  with  short  stature,  including  but  not  limited  to Prader-Willi syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Noonan syndrome;
- Active seizure disorders. Defined as one or more seizures per month, irrespective of anticonvulsant therapy;
- Administration of any growth-altering medication within 3 months of Visit 1, including therapies for attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity disorder or anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoids for longer than 2 weeks. Hormone replacement therapies for children with hypothyroidism were permitted;
- Significant abnormality in clinical screening laboratories, as determined by the investigator;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Any current or previous exposure to therapeutic spinal irradiation;
- Evidence of clinical malnutrition or growth deficit attributable to emotional deprivation;
- Evidence of any active malignancy or intracranial tumors;
- Evidence for organic hypopituitarism;
- Use of investigational medication(s) within the last month;
- Any other social or medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be detrimental to either the subject or the study (for example, subjects whose families were planning to relocate, or subjects with suspected but not yet proven chromosomal abnormalities, were not to be included)

## Sample size determination

Dunnett's  test  for  multiple  comparisons  was  used  in  the  primary  analysis,  but  for  the  purposes  of computing approximate power, alpha=0.0173 was used in each of three tests.

While 25 subjects were planned in each group, for the purpose of estimating power it was assumed that only 23 subjects per group would complete the first year of the study. It was also assumed that there is a mean difference of 2.0 cm/year (y) between rhGH monotherapy and combination therapy, and  that  the  common  within  treatment  arm  standard  deviation  (SD)  was  1.6  cm/y.  Under  these assumptions, the power was predicted at 96%.

- Treatments

Eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups, stratified by age ≤9 years and IGF 1 SDS ≤-2 at Screening, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio:

- 45 μg/kg/day rhGH;
- 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 50 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:1.1);
- 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 100 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:2.2);
- 45 μg/kg/day rhGH + 150 μg/kg/day rhIGF-1 (approximately 1:3.3).

In the US, many of the subjects in this study population could be prescribed somatropin for a diagnosis of  ISS.  Therefore,  the  active  comparator  for  this  study  was  rhGH  at  a  dose  similar  to  that recommended in this group: 45 μg/kg/day.

The optimal ratio for rhGH to rhIGF-1 was unknown, so a range of drug ratios (approximately 1:1.1, 1:2.2 and 1:3.3) was selected for the study. These ratios correspond to rhIGF-1 doses of 50, 100, and 150 μg/kg/day once per day (QD), and were chosen to be below the equivalent total daily dose of rhIGF-1 (160-240 μg/kg) currently approved for the treatment of children with short stature due to severe Primary IGFD (80-120 μg/kg twice per day [BID]).

Prior studies were used to make estimates of the serum IGF-1 levels that would be expected to occur during combination of rhGH and rhIGF-1 treatment.

## Dose Titrations

Subjects commenced treatment on Day 1 (Visit 2) at 50% of their assigned dose.

Full doses commenced on the day immediately following Day 15 (Visit 3).

## Dose Reductions

Subjects  experiencing  significant  AEs  with  their  assigned  rhGH  or  rhIGF-1  dose  could  be  moved temporarily  to  a  lower  dose  at  the  same  rhGH  to  rhIGF-1  ratio;  or,  if  already  on  a  lowered  dose, removed from study drug on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.

In cases where sustained serum IGF-1 SDSs above +4 were observed a dose reduction may have been used at the discretion of the Medical Monitor and Investigator.

IGF-1 has insulin-like activity and the potential for hypoglycemic events is heightened during fasting. Parents/guardians of subjects receiving rhIGF-1 were instructed not to administer either study drug on days where breakfast was missed (for example, due to illness or planned dental work).

Whether a dose omission was intentional or otherwise, it was emphasized that no attempt should be made  to  'catch-up'  on  a  missed  dose  by  administering  the  study  drugs  later  in  the  day  or  by administering a double dose the following day.

The time and reason for the omitted dose was to be recorded in the Subject Diary.

- o Laboratory data including haematology, biochemistry, non-fasting capillary
- o blood glucose and urinalysis
- o Vital signs

## Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart

The timing of safety and efficacy evaluations performed during the first three years of the study are specified in the study protocol (Amendment 1).

- Statistical Methods

## Statistical analysis strategy

The statistical analyses will be performed in accordance with ICH E9 guidelines and will be based on the pooled data from the individual study sites, unless otherwise stated.

Ipsen  will  perform  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetic  an antibodies data.

## Multiplicity

A two-sided test will be performed for each of the 3 combination treatment (COM) groups versus the group with GH alone.

Formally, the null hypothesis for each combination group is:

H0: Height Velocitycom = Height Velocity GH

and the alternative hypothesis is:

Ha: Height Velocity com ≠ Height Velocity GH

Dunnett's test will be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the statistical tests will be two-sided at 1.73 % level of significance for the comparisons of each combo arm with GH alone.

## Primary efficacy analysis

The primary efficacy analysis will use a modified intent-to-treat population. A two-sided test will be performed for  each  of  the  3  combination  treatment  (COM)  groups  versus  the  group  with  GH  alone using  analysis  of  covariance  with  the  Year  1  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with randomization strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates.

Exploratory sensitivity analysis of the height velocity within the population of patients who completed the first year will be performed using pubertal status, bone age and presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 antibodies as additional covariates along with the covariates specified in the primary analysis.

## Secondary efficacy analysis

## a) Height velocity during the second, third and fourth year

A two-sided test will be performed using the modified intention-to-treat population by comparing pairs of COM groups using analysis of covariance as above. Formally the null hypothesis for the comparison of each pair of combination groups is:

H0: Height Velocity COM 2 = Height Velocity COM 1

and the alternative hypothesis is:

Ha: Height Velocity COM 2 &gt; Height Velocity COM 1 where the IGF-1 dose for COM 2 &gt; the dose for COM 1.

Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of subjects who completed the first, second, third and fourth year of the study.

Missing  end-of-study  height  velocities  will  be  imputed  where  necessary  for  the  intention-to-treat population as described below.

## b) Change in height SDS during the first, second, third and fourth year

Height  SDS  scores  will  be  calculated  using  the  National  Center  for  Health  Statistics  2000  data  as provided  by  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  (Kuczmarski,  Ogden  et  al.  2002).  Change  in  height  SD score will be analysed using the modified ITT population by comparing pairs of groups using analysis of covariance.

Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of subjects who completed the first, second, third and fourth year of the study.

Similar analysis will also be performed using a subgroup of pubertal subjects who completed the first, second, third and fourth year of the study.

## c) Change in predicted adult height during the first, second, third and fourth year

The  Roche-Wainer-Thissen  predicted  adult  height  and  adjusted  for  growth  after  age  18  for  pretreatment, Year one, two, three and four will be summarized by treatment arm for subjects completing the year based on baseline height SD score and mid-parental target height SD score.

The mid-parental target height SD score will be computed as 0.4 * (Mother's Height SDS + Father's Height SDS)

The predicted adult height will also be presented in cm and summarized by treatment arm for pretreatment, Year one, two, three and four.

## d) Total change in height

Total change in height will be summarized by treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## e) Total change in height SDS

Total change in height SDS will be summarized by treatment arm.

## f) Total change in predicted adult height divided by total change in chronological age

Total change in predicted adult height divided by total age in chronological age will be summarized by treatment arm.

## g) Changes in serum concentrations of GH, IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins acid labile subunit (ALS), and GH binding proteins (GHBP)

The change in serum concentrations between baseline and each visit will be presented by treatment arm.

## h) Skeletal maturation

The height age of a patient is defined as the age at which the median height of the general population of the same sex is equal to the height of the patient in question. For example, if a girl has a height of 132.7 cm, then her height age is 9 years old because the median height for 9-year-old girls is 132.7 cm. If the age of the girl is 11, then her height age would be two years behind her chronological age. Bone and height age are summarized by treatment arm at baseline, Year 1, 2, 3, 4 and at the End Of Study. The change from baseline to each of the endpoints and the change between two consecutive years will also be presented for bone and height age. In addition, the change between chronological age and bone age will be summarized by treatment arm at baseline, Year 1, 2, 3, 4 and at the End of Study.

## i) Total change in BMI SDS

The change in BMI SDS between baseline and last value available will be presented by treatment arm.

## Safety

All  safety  data  will  be  included  in  the  data  listings  and  summary  tables  will be  based  on  the  safety population.  The  safety  analysis  will  focus  on  the  safety  of  GH/IGF-1  combination  therapy  with  GH monotherapy  as  a  comparator.  Additionally,  events  known  to  be  associated  with  IGF-1  will  be evaluated for any change in incidence during combination therapy.

## Missing data

The intention-to-treat principle will be used in the analysis of height velocity and change in height SD score.  Missing  end-of-year-one  height  SD  scores  will  be  imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried forward (LOCF), i.e., if the height at Week 52 is missing for a given subject, then the last observed height SD score for that subject is used as the Week 52 (1 year) height SD score. Height velocities will be imputed assuming no change in height SD score after the last height measurement.

## Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

The  study  patients  were  recruited  from  27  centers  in  the  US.  The  first  subject  was  randomized  in January 2008. The study was prematurely terminated once the last subject had completed three years of treatment which happened in March 2012.

## Data Sets Analysed

First year height velocity is the primary efficacy endpoint of this 6-year study. However, the study was prematurely  terminated.  At  the  termination  of  this  study,  79  subjects  had  completed  3  years  of treatment and 17 subjects had completed 4 years of.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy analysis for this  report  was  based  on  the  Modified  ITT  population  (MITT).  The assessment of PK was based on the PK population and the assessment of safety and tolerability was based on the Safety population. Table 5 (below) summarizes the populations defined for the report.

| Modified Intent-to- Treat (MITT) Population (N=105) | MITT population comprised all subjects who were randomized and had at least one post-baseline height measurement. Only one subject, 1210001, was excluded from the MITT population after having been withdrawn from the study on Day 27 due to GH deficiency (the subject was briefly treated and was therefore included in the safety population). The primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints (height velocity during the second, third and fourth year; cumulative change in height SD during the first, second, third and fourth year) used LOCF data imputation (as described in Section 9.8.2.4) for subjects withdrawn prior to the endpoint of interest. Other efficacy analyses used no imputation and analysed only those subjects who completed the study up to the point of interest. In each instance, the population used is defined in the relevant table title. |
| PK Population (N=103)                               | The PK population consists of all subjects who received study treatment on the day of PK sampling and provided IGF-1 or/and GH levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Treatment compliance was evaluated by the  number and the percent of missed injections for  each subject using the subject diary. All subjects missed at least one injection of rhGH and rhIGF-1. For both the rhGH and the rhIGF-1 injections, in all treatment groups, 75% of subjects missed less than 13% of their doses.

Subjects who had a dose withheld temporarily due to an AE or because of a planned procedure which limited food intake were not considered to be non-compliant. In addition, the Sponsor mandated dose reductions, due to high near-peak rhIGF-1 SDS. In those incidences, subjects were instructed to take a lower  dose  at  the  same  rhGH  to  rhIGF-1  ratio.  Up  to  two  dose  reductions  were  allowed  and  if necessary a subject could be removed from study drug on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Medical Monitor and the Investigator. No subject was removed from the study for this reason.

There were no dose reductions in the rhGH alone treatment group. The number of subjects with dose reductions were 2, 10 and 14 in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment groups, respectively. Some of the subjects had more than one dose reduction.

## · Baseline data

A total of 106 subjects with low IGF-1 and short-stature were randomized to treatment. The population demographics are summarized in Table 6.

The majority of subjects, 85/106 (80.2%), were male and gender composition was similar across the four treatment groups, except for a slightly higher proportion of females in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group. A total of 79/106 (74.5%) subjects were white, and while subjects of other ethnic origins were distributed across all four treatment groups, a slight disparity exists between the proportion of white subjects in the 45 rhGH group (17/26 subjects; 65.4%) and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (23/26 subjects; 88.5%).

Randomization to one of the four treatment groups was stratified by age ≤9 years and IGF-1 SDS ≤-2. Evaluations  at  Visit  2  formed  the  baseline  against  which  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints were assessed. These baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 7.

- Efficacy results

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Height Velocity During the First Year of Treatment

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  MITT  population.  This  population  included  all subjects  and  used  LOCF  data  imputation  for  subjects  withdrawn  prior  to  completing  1  year  of treatment.

A two-sided ANCOVA was performed for each of the three combination treatment groups versus the rhGH  alone  group,  using  Year  1  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with  randomization strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates. The results are reported in Table 9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 22 subjects were deemed to have entered puberty (breast/testes stage 2) during the first year of the study. Only one subject reached stage 3, a male in the GH monotherapy group at age 12.8 years.

Exploratory sensitivity analyses of the height velocity ANCOVA, within this population of subjects who completed the first year, were performed with pubertal status, bone age and presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 as additional covariates. Neither pubertal status nor bone age or the presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 affected the statistical significance observed in the primary analysis.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Height Velocity during the Second, Third and Fourth Year of Treatment

As  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  secondary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  MITT population. This population included all subjects and used LOCF data imputation for subjects withdrawn prior to completing the second, third or fourth year of treatment. Imputation for each year is used for any subject that had one or more height measurement documented during that year. Subjects who withdrew prior to the collection of a height measurement in that year were excluded from the analysis.

A two-sided ANCOVA was performed for each of the three combination treatment groups versus the rhGH  alone  group,  using  Year  2  height  velocity  as  the  dependent  variable  and  with  randomization strata defined by baseline age and IGF-1 SDS as covariates. The results are reported in Table 11.

The  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically  significant  with p&lt;0.001 and 95% CI of 0.84 to 2.52 cm/y.

The results without imputation for subjects who did not complete Year 2 are in line with MITT with imputation:  the  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically significant with p&lt;0.001. Additionally, the difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF1 was also statistically significant (p=0.008).

The analysis of subjects completing 2 years showed a statistically significant difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 (p=0.008) that was not observed in the corresponding analysis of the MITT population (p=0.081).

The results without imputation for subjects who did not complete Year 3 are in line with the results observed with the results observed with second year height velocity:

1. With subjects with imputation who did not complete Year 3 the difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significant with p=0.005. The difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 was also statistically significant with p=0.038.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. With  subjects  without  imputation  who  did  not  complete  Year  3  the  difference  between  45  rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significant with p=0.019. The difference between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 was also statistically significant with p=0.034.

The number of subjects with data from Year 4 was very low. Therefore, no statistical conclusions could be reached.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Cumulative Change in Height SDS during the First, Second, Third and Fourth Year of Treatment

A statistically significant difference was observed for the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group with a 95% CI of 0.13 to 0.48 (p=0.003) in the first year height SDS (subjects with imputation).

In the second year height SDS (subjects with imputation) the difference was statistically significant for the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (p=0.021)  and  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  (p&lt;0.001),  but  not significant for the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 group. A parallel analysis considering only those subjects who completed the second year of treatment was performed and showed similar results.

In the third year height SDS (subjects with imputation) the difference was statistically significant for the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (p=0.008)  and  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  (p=0.001),  but  not significant for the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 group. A parallel analysis considering only those subjects who completed the third year of treatment was performed and showed similar results.

The number of subjects with data from Year 4 was very low. Therefore, no statistical conclusions could be reached.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Predicted Adult Height

All four treatment groups demonstrated an improvement in RWT predicted adult height SDS during the first year of treatment, but the change was higher in the three combination groups.

Mean±SD  change  in  RWT  PAH  SDS  was  0.53±0.36  in  the  45  rhGH  (n=24),  0.63±0.21  in  the  45 rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group  (n=25),  0.67±0.37  in  the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (n=22),  and 0.76±0.31 in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (n=25).

This improvement was sustained during the second and third year of treatment and remained higher in the three combination groups.

There is more variability in the RWT predicted adult height than in the mid-parental target height, in particular in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment group.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Total Change in BMI SDS

Baseline BMI SDS is not as low as height SDS, indicating that subjects have more of a deficit in height than in body mass. A Student t-test was performed to analyse whether there was a change in BMI between baseline and the end of study.

The results demonstrate a shift toward normalization of BMI SDS at the End of Study as compared to Baseline in all four treatment groups (p&lt;0.005 in all four groups). The effect seems more pronounced in the three combination groups (the mean change from Baseline to the end of the study was 0.45; 0.42 and 0.64 in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1; 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group respectively compared to 0.34 in the 45 rhGH alone treatment group)

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Skeletal Maturation

As expected, bone age at Baseline was delayed in relation to chronological age in all treatment groups. Bone age increased in all treatment groups. The mean increase was in the same range of magnitude between the rhGH alone group and the combination groups at Year 1.

There was a trend for a slightly higher advancement in bone age at Year 3 in the combination groups compared  to  rhGH  alone  (4.0  versus  3.8).  These  data  indicate  that  increased  growth  was  not accompanied by undue skeletal maturation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The anthropometric data collected were not consistent due to the lack of practice of the site staff that performed  this  measurement.  Therefore;  these  data  were  considered  unreliable  and  could  not  be interpreted.

## Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoint:  Changes  in  Serum  Concentrations  of  GH,  IGF-1,  Insulin-like  Growth Factor Binding Proteins, Acid-Labile Subunit (ALS), and GH Binding Proteins (GHBP)

Trough serum GH values are highly variable in all the treatment groups. There is a trend for slight reduction of trough serum GH and GHBP in the combination groups.

As expected mean IGF-1 trough levels increased on therapy with a more important increase in the combination groups than in the rhGH alone group, without evidence of a clear dose effect. For the IGF1 and IGF-1 SDS near peak values, there was an increase between the values at Week 39 and at Week 120 for all groups. However, in the combination groups, these values decreased between Week 120 and Week 173, which may be due to mandated dose reductions.

The  mean  near  peak  IGF-1  SD  was  at  least  2.5  SD  between  Week  39  and  Week  120  in  the  45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups.

The mean trough IGF-1 SDS remained within the normal range at Year 1 and Year 3 in all groups. At Year 2, it was slightly higher than 2 SD (+2.26) in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and close to +2 SD (+1.85) in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group.

Other  IGF  related  proteins  changed  on  therapy:  IGFBP-3  increased  in  all  groups,  within  the  same magnitude, remaining within normal ranges; IGFBP-1 levels decreased within the same magnitude in all treatment groups.

## Drug Dose, Drug Concentration, and Relationships to Response

Mini-PK/PD multiple-sampling data for GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 at a single visit are presented here.

There  is  a  complex  interaction  between  GH,  IGF-1  and  their  associated  binding  proteins  -  most significantly IGFBP-3. While not strictly speaking a PK variable, IGFBP-3 is the most abundant of IGF-1 binding  proteins.  And  since  unbound  IGF-1  has  more  rapid  clearance  than  bound  IGF-1,  increased IGFBP-3  is  correlated  with  increased  serum  IGF-1.  This  relationship  is  complicated  by  negative feedback whereby GH-stimulated up regulation of IGFBP-3 (via ALS) is inhibited by increased IGF-1 inhibiting GH release.

The results of the mini PK analysis are intended to be used in the preparation of a model designed to elucidate the PK/PD behaviour resulting from GH/IGF-1 co-administration, and also to inform future dose-reduction strategies.

Blood samples for mini-PK analysis of GH and IGF-1 were drawn at T0 (pre-dose), T+2 hours and T+4 hours at Visit 4.

The mini PK results for GH are in line with what might be expected given that all subjects received a flat dose of 45 μg/kg rhGH, and thus demonstrate that there was no influence of the increasing doses of rhIGF-1 on the PK of GH in these subjects.

At Week 4, peak concentrations occurred at T+2 hours in all groups.

The mini PK results for IGF-1 are in line with expectations. Note that the smaller peak at Week 2 is due to subjects receiving a half dose for the first two weeks of treatment before being increased to their full dose. At Week 4, peak concentrations occurred at T+2 hours in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups and at T+4 hours in the 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 groups, but the difference in IGF-1 level between these two time points was small in all groups.

Mean±SD serum IGF-1  concentration  peaked  at  197.9±78.0  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH  group  (n=25), 397.9±113.7  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group  (n=26),  430.3±118.7  ng/mL  in  the  45 rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  (n=26),  and  510.9±135.9  ng/mL  in  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group (n=25). No difference in mean trough IGF-1 level between treatment groups is apparent at Week 4.

The complex interactions between GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are illustrated by the IGFBP-3 profiles of the three combination groups, which cannot be readily related to the IGF-1 dose. Note that the smaller peak at Week 2 is due to subjects receiving a half dose for the first two weeks of treatment before being increased to their full dose.

At  Week  4,  mean±SD  peak  IGFBP-3  concentrations  occurred  at  T+2  hours  in  the  45  rhGH  group (2704.0±474.8 ng/mL; n=25), T+2 hours in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 group (2623.1±551.6 ng/mL;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

n=26), T+4 hours in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group (2561.5±399.1 ng/mL; n=26), and T+4 hours in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (2661.5±1107.5 ng/mL; n=26).

## Efficacy Conclusions

First  year  height  velocity  within  the  MITT  population  showed  significant  difference  between  the  45 rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH + 150 rhIGF-1 group p=0.001 and 95% CI of 0.90 to3.01 cm/y. First year height velocity within the MITT population, with imputation for early withdrawals (Table 9), was 9.3±1.7 cm/y in the 45 rhGH group, 10.1±1.3 cm/y in the 45 rhGH+50 IGF-1 group, 9.7±2.5 cm/y in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and 11.2±2.1 cm/y in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF- 1 group.

The differences between 45 rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 were not statistically significant.

When repeating the primary analysis using only subjects who completed 1 year of treatment (n=96), statistical significance remained the same as in the MITT analysis.

In  addition,  3  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  using  pubertal  status,  bone  age  or  presence  or absence of anti-IGF-1 antibodies as covariates. The results support the findings in the primary efficacy analysis.

Height velocity observed during the first year of treatment was expected to decrease in subsequent years in all groups. The effect of the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group compared to the 45 rhGH alone on height  velocity  was  sustained  during  the  second  and  the  third  year  of  treatment  in  both  MITT  and completers  population.  The  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  group  showed  significantly  increased  efficacy compared to 45 rhGH alone during the second year in completers and during the third year in both populations.

The first year change in height SDS within the MITT population showed significant difference between the 45 rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (p=0.003.)

group.  The  effect  seen  in  the  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group  on  cumulative  change  in  height  SDS compared to the 45 rhGH alone group is sustained during the second and third year of treatment in both MITT and completers. After 3 years of treatment the cumulative height SDS gain is 1.9 in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group.

All  four  treatment  groups  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  RWT  PAH  SDS  during  the  first  year  of treatment. The change was higher in the three combination groups. The most important increase was observed during the first year which is in line with the catch-up in height observed during the first year.

There was no influence of the increasing doses of IGF-1 on the PK of GH in these subjects. There was an increase in GH from trough (Baseline) to T+2 and T+4 hours at Week 4 in all treatment groups. No difference in mean trough IGF-1 level between treatment groups was apparent at Week 4. In the 45 rhGH monotherapy group IGF-1 trough level at Week 4 had a mean of 207.9. This was similar to the observations in the combination therapy groups which were 206.5, 205.3 and 213.3 in the 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 groups, respectively.

Overall, these efficacy results demonstrate that combination therapy elicits accelerated statural growth without an excessive increase in skeletal maturation or undue increase in BMI.

## Adverse Events

A total of 1716 AEs were reported in the study and 1685 of these events were treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All subjects experienced at least one TEAE.

The number of occurrences of any AEs were 381, 416, 401 and 518 in the 45 rhGH alone, 45rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment group.

The  number  of  occurrences  of  TEAEs  were  374,  406,  392  and  513  in  the  corresponding  treatment groups (above).

Subjects that experienced one or more TEAEs are summarized in Table 38.

A smaller proportion of subjects in the rhGH monotherapy group experienced at least one treatment related TEAE than in any of the three combination groups. There were 11/26 subjects (42.3%) in the monotherapy  group,  17/27  subjects  (63.0%)  in  the  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1  group;  20/27  subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(74.1%) in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and 20/26 subjects (76.9%) in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group. This effect may be expected since rhGH and rhIGF-1 have distinct AE profiles.

The  difference  between  rhGH  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  is  seen  mostly  in  mild  and moderate related TEAEs. Proportions of severe related events are similar across all groups.

Four  out  of  five  subjects  who  experienced  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  were  in  the  combination groups.  Only  two  SAEs  were  considered  related  to  treatment:  Papilledema  in  a  subject  in  the  45 rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  group  and  intracranial  hypertension  in  a  subject  in  the  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1 group.

The TEAE headache was reported with the highest incidence (63 subjects with 172 occurrences). The number of subjects reporting headache was 14/26 (54%), 14/27 (52%), 17/27 (63%), 18/26 (69%) in the  rhGH,  45  rhGH+50  rhIGF-1,  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH  +  150  rhIGF-1  groups respectively. A slight increase in the incidence of headache is noted as the dose in the combination group increased.

Upper respiratory tract infection had the second highest incidence (42 subjects with 110 occurrences). The number of subjects reporting upper respiratory tract infection was 10/26 (39%), 10/27 (37%), 9/27 (33%) and 13/26 (50%) in the corresponding treatment groups (above).

Pyrexia  had  the  third  highest  incidence  (41  subjects  with  85  occurrences).  The  number  of  subjects reporting pyrexia was 9/26 (35%), 15/27 (56%), 4/27 (15%) and 13/26 (50%) in the corresponding treatment groups (above).

## Related TEAEs reported in ≥5% subjects receiving rhGH alone or receiving combination therapy

The treatment related TEAE of headache was reported with the highest incidence (28 subjects with 61 occurrences). The number of subjects reporting headache was 4/26 (15%), 4/27 (15%), 10/27 (37%), 10/26 (39%) in the in the corresponding treatment groups (above).

Injection  site  hypertrophy  (15  subjects  with  24  occurrences)  had  the  next  highest  incidence.  The number of subjects reporting injection site hypertrophy was 0/26 (0%), 6/27 (22%), 7/27 (26%) and 2/26 (8%) in the corresponding treatment groups (above).

## TEAEs of Special Interest

TEAEs of special interest, either present in the mecasermin labelling or linked to rhIGF-1 treatment in the  published  literature  are  summarized  in  Table  41.  In  this  table  PTs  are  ordered  by  percent  of subjects in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF group.

Hypoglycemia was observed in the rhGH alone and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group only.

There  are  two  special  interest  events  occurring  with  &gt;10%  difference  in  incidence  between  all combination groups and rhGH monotherapy subjects.

Lipohypertrophy was seen at &gt;10% difference in the combination group versus the rhGH alone group (16/80 (20%) versus 0/26 (0%)). Tonsillar or adenoid hypertrophy reported frequencies were greater in the rhGH alone group ((4/26 (15%) compared to the combination groups (4/80 (5%)).

The  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  combination  group  had  the  highest  incidence  of  the  following  TEAEs  of special interest: headache, otitis media, vomiting and hypoglycemia.

Related  TEAEs  were  all  of  expected  types  and  did  not  occur  in  greater  frequency  than  has  been previously  observed.  Three  subjects  experienced  severe  and  related  events:  headache  in  one  rhGH monotherapy and one combination therapy subject, and one injection site hypertrophy in a separate combination therapy subject. There was no evidence of TEAE that was new or unexpected based on the known safety profiles of rhGH and rhIGF-1. The observed safety data was analysed for any change in incidence or severity among subjects receiving combination therapy.

## Hypoglycemia

Eleven hypoglycemia occurrences have been reported in nine subjects during the present study: 2/26 (8%) subjects in the 45 rhGH monotherapy group and 7/80 (9%) in the combination groups. All of these events occurred within the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group.

All  hypoglycemic  events  were  mild  except  one  which  was  of  moderate  intensity.  In  three  subjects hypoglycemia  was  resolved  spontaneously  while  in  three  other  subjects  it resolved following unspecified treatment (most likely food and/or juice). For the other three subjects no information on treatment was reported. No subject had a dose reduction for a hypoglycaemia TEAE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One  TEAE  of  intracranial  hypertension  has  been  reported  (serious,  moderate,  related)  in  the  45 GH+100 IGF-1 group and one TEAE of papilledema (serious, moderate, related) in the 45 GH+150 IGF-1 group, both of which were recorded as resolved.

## Headache

For those subjects who reported headaches, the Kaplan-Meier results demonstrate that headache was reported  earlier  by  subjects  treated  with  combination  therapy  (median=19  days;  n=80)  than  with rhGH monotherapy (median=73 days; n=26).

There  seems  to  be  a  trend  between  the  dose  and  the  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  a  first headache in the earlier stage of the study (i.e. at month 8: 38%, 44%, 48% and 62% of the subject in the 45 rhGH alone, 45 rhGH+50 rhIGF-1, 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 and 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 treatment groups had experienced their first headache). However, this trend seems to fade in later phases of the study (after month 16). All subjects began treatment at half the assigned dose and increased to full assigned dose at Week 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Allergic reactions and other immunopathological effects

As with all cell-derived proteins, allergic reactions and other immunopathological effects are a potential risk with rhGH and rhIGF-1. In the current study, nine subjects experienced TEAEs of urticaria, 2/26 (8%)  of  subjects  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group  and  7/80  (9%)  of  subjects  in  the  combination groups.

All nine subjects who experienced urticaria were negative for anti-IGF-1 antibodies on Day 1. At the Year 1 sampling, the two subjects in the GH monotherapy group remained negative. Three subjects in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 had missing values due to withdrawal prior to the Year 1 antibody sampling.

Two of the subjects in the combination groups experienced AEs of moderate intensity that led to their withdrawal from treatment. In both cases an allergist confirmed allergy to rhGH by skin prick test. Both events were recorded as resolved following cessation of treatment.

One subject in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group was anti-IGF-1 antibody negative and three subjects in this group were anti-IGF-1 antibody positive.

The  subjects  that  tested  positive  continued  on  treatment  with  combination  therapy  with  no  further incidents of urticaria.

Considering  the  safety  of  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  in  comparison  with  rhIGF-1  monotherapy,  no additional concerns are evident. Notably, the percentage of subjects experiencing hypoglycemia in the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group was lower than the 42% reported in the label for the approved indication of rhIGF-1 monotherapy.

Five  subjects  experienced  SAEs  during  the  study.  Two  of  these  five  subjects  experienced  SAEs considered related to treatment by the Investigator: intracranial hypertension and papilledema.

## AEs leading to withdrawal

A total of ten subjects had AEWDs; characterized by a reported disposition of withdrawn due to AE (table 44.) Six out of ten were considered related to the treatment of which two were in the 45 rhGH alone group.

## Safety Conclusions

The  difference  between  rhGH  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  is  seen  mostly  in  mild  and moderate related TEAEs. Proportions of severe related events are similar across all groups.

Three subjects experienced severe and related events: headache in one rhGH monotherapy subject and one combination therapy subject, and injection site hypertrophy in a separate combination therapy subject.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was no evidence of any TEAE that was new or unexpected, based on the known safety profiles of rhGH and rhIGF-1.

Incidence of TEAEs of special interest: hypoglycemia, headache, vomiting and otitis media was higher in the 45 rhGH+rh150 IGF-1 group than in all other groups.

Headache, whether treatment related or not, was reported in more subjects overall than any other PT (63/106  subjects).  For  those  subjects  who  experienced  a  headache,  a  Kaplan-Meier  analysis demonstrated  that  headache  was  reached  more  quickly  among  subjects  in  the  combination  groups (median  time  to  headache  onset=19  days;  n=80)  than  those  in  the  rhGH  monotherapy  group (median=73 days; n=26).

The PT with the second highest incidence of treatment related TEAEs was injection site hypertrophy (15 subjects, 24 occurrences). All subjects with these events were in the combination groups, as might be expected given that combination therapy requires two separate injections.

Nine subjects experienced TEAEs of urticaria, 2/26 (8%) of subjects in the rhGH monotherapy group and 7/80 (9%) of subjects in the combination groups. Two of the subjects in the combination groups experienced urticaria of moderate intensity that led to their withdrawal from treatment.

The  only  treatment  related  SAEs  were  intracranial  hypertension  and  papilledema  in  two  separate subjects  receiving  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1.  Both  events  were  reported  to have  resolved  following  dose-interruption.  After  increasing  back  to  the  original  dose,  one  subject remained on study.

## Rapporteur's discussion on clinical aspects

Currently  mecasermin  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  growth  failure  in  children  and adolescents from 2 to 18 years with severe primary insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency (Primary IGFD).

Severe Primary IGFD is defined by:

- height standard deviation score ≤-3.0 and
- basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5 th percentile for age and gender and
- GH sufficiency.
- Exclusion  of  secondary  forms  of  IGF  1  deficiency,  such  as  malnutrition,  hypothyroidism,  or chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory steroids.

The dose should be individualised for each patient. The recommended starting dose of mecasermin is 0.04 mg/kg of body weight twice daily by subcutaneous injection. If no significant adverse reactions occur for at least one week, the dose may be raised in increments of 0.04 mg/kg to the maximum dose of 0.12 mg/kg given twice daily.

The  current  study,  which  has  been  submitted  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, was carried out as a 'proof of principle'- study in children with short stature associated with less severe IGF-1 deficiency (IGF-1 SDS of ≤-1.0, height SDS of ≤2.0) and in combination with hGH. Hence this indication and treatment combination are outside the current  EU-indication  of  mecasermin.  Children  were  treated  with  either  of  rhGH  alone  or  rhGH combined  with  50,  100  or  150  μg/kg  mecasermin  daily.  Thus  the  amount  of  a  single  dose  of mecasermin  could  be  more  than  for  currently  approved  indication  (120  μg/kg).  The  rationale  for testing the combination of hGH and rhIGF-1 therapy for short stature children with low IGF-1 seemed logical and the selected treatment combinations seemed to be appropriately chosen.

This study was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to company's strategic reasons. However, the original (before amendment to increase the duration to 6 years) three year treatment duration was achieved.

106 subjects  were  recruited  for  this  study.  Actually,  one  subject  was  subsequently  found  to  be  GH deficient and therefore excluded from the MITT population. The population selected to MITT and the statistical methods chosen for the primary and secondary endpoints and sample size seemed adequate. Subject characteristics at enrollment were quite well balanced except for a slightly higher proportion of females in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

96 out of 105 subjects completed 1 year treatment with 6 withdrawals due to AE. The drop-out rate due  to  AE  was  low  (10)  with  withdrawal  due  mecasermin  related  AE  in  4  subjects.  Altogether  79 subjects completed the planned 3 year treatment.

For  some  patients  the  starting  dose  was  too  high  reflecting  dose  reductions  which  were  guided  by frequent IGF-1 level measurements guided by the protocol. 4 subjects in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group and 5 subjects in the 45 rhGH+160 rhIGF-1 group required dose reductions during year 1.

Anti-IGF-1 analysis results were not available for all subjects at the time of this report. However, in subjects with mecasermin treatment 53.8 to 59.3% of the subjects were Anti-IGF-1 antibody positive on year 1 with ca. 25% of the results missing. The meaning of this antibody positivity has not been discussed  by  the  MAH;  instead,  the  MAH  states  in  their  Clinical  Overview  that 'A  low  and  clinically insignificant percentage of anti-IGF-1 antibodies was reported .' This statement is not agreed. The MAH should provide the final data (those missing 25% of the analyses, or an explanation why they were not reported) and discuss the meaning of it.

Further, so far, the MAH has not been able to develop an assay for neutralising antibodies. Therefore, the MAH is, again, strongly encouraged to finalise the development of that assay and provide analysis of clinical samples (primarily of those patients where mecasermin has been used within the approved indication;  analysis  of  the  samples  of  the  current  study  could  also  provide  some  further  valuable information on the issue), in order to gain understanding of the frequency and clinical relevance of the neutralising antibodies against mecasermin.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was height velocity during the first year of treatment. It was  found  that  the  difference  between  45  rhGH  alone  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1  was  statistically significant with p=0.001. This finding was similar whether subjects who did not complete year 1 were imputated or not. In the exploratory sensitivity analyses neither pubertal status nor bone age or the presence or absence of anti-IGF-1 affected this statistical significance.

The results for the secondary efficacy endpoint (height velocity during the second and third year of treatment) were in line with the primary efficacy endpoint. The combination of 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was statistically significantly better than 45 rhGH alone for all these endpoints. While some statistically significant results were also observed in the 45 rhGH+100 rhIGF-1 group, the effect of 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 was more constant.

For the other secondary endpoints, the first year change in height SDS showed significant difference between the 45 rhGH alone group and the 45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group (p=0.003.) All four treatment groups demonstrated an improvement in RWT PAH SDS during the first year of treatment. The change was higher in the three combination groups.

The  efficacy  results  demonstrate  that  combination  therapy  with  45  rhGH+150  mecasermin  was beneficial with accelerated statural growth in subjects with less severe IGF-1 deficiency than with the currently approved indication.

Regarding safety, no new safety concerns were found. More mild and moderate AEs were found with the combination therapy groups than in the rhGH alone group. Incidence of TEAEs of special interest such as hypoglycemia, headache, vomiting and otitis media was higher in the 45 rhGH+rh150 IGF-1 group than in all other groups.

However,  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  (8%  in  the  45  rhGH  alone  group  and  27%  in  the  45 rhGH+150 rhIGF-1 group) was less than with the already approved indication (47%, Increlex SPC). The PT with the second highest incidence of treatment related TEAEs was injection site hypertrophy (15 subjects,  24  occurrences).  The  incidence  of  injection  site  hypertrophy  is  similar  than  previously reported (i.e. Study 306, 14%).

Two of the subjects in the combination groups experienced urticaria of moderate intensity that led to their withdrawal from treatment; urticarial is mentioned in the Increlex-SPC.

The  only  treatment  related  SAEs  were  intracranial  hypertension  and  papilledema  in  two  separate subjects  receiving  45  rhGH+100  rhIGF-1  and  45  rhGH+150  rhIGF-1.  Both  events  were  reported  to have  resolved  following  dose-interruption.  After  increasing  back  to  the  original  dose,  one  subject remained on study. Also these ADRs are mentioned in the Increlex-SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general, there were no unexpected TEAEs.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## MAH conclusion

The  MAH  concludes  that  with  the  new  therapeutic  modality,  namely  the  co-administration  of  two recombinant growth-promoting hormones (hGH 45 μg/kg/day + rhIGF-1 150 μg/kg/day) in children with significant short stature greater height velocity and change in height SDS during three years of continuous therapy was induced compared to hGH 45 μg/kg/day alone.

It is also important to note that childhood short stature, and particularly the type represented in this study, is not a life-threatening disorder. It may be associated with some psychological stress, although this is generally thought to be mild. However there is no proven morbidity associated with its lack of treatment.  This  consideration  places  the  safety  aspects  of  the  MS316  study  at  the  forefront  of discussion relating to the future of this combination therapy. The most efficacious dose, ie rhIGF-1 150 μg/kg/day, was associated with more adverse events and abnormally elevated serum IGF-1 levels than hGH alone.

Nevertheless, based on MS 316 study results, the risk benefit of the combination of hGH + rhIGF-1 is favourable in the population of children with idiopathic short stature and low IGF 1 levels.

No regulatory action is deemed necessary as a consequence of these study results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's conclusion

The  MAH  has  submitted  the  current  MS316  study  to  EMA  in  accordance  with  the  Article  46  of  the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. The study was carried out as a 'proof of principle'- study in children with short stature associated with less severe IGF-1 deficiency than in the current EU-SPC for  Increlex  and  in  combination  with  hGH.  Hence  the  studied  indication  and  treatment  regimen (combination  with  hGH)  are  outside  of  the  current  EU-indication  for  mecasermin.  Further,  it  is noteworthy that this studied non-life threatening indication is slightly controversial.

Children were treated with either of rhGH alone or rhGH combined with different doses of mecasermin. The rationale for testing the combination of hGH and rhIGF-1 therapy for short stature children with low  IGF-1  was  based  on  evidence  of  independent  and  complementary  actions  of  GH  and  IGF-1  to promote growth and the prevalence of GH insensitivity and low serum IGF-1 levels in children with idiopathic short stature. The combination therapy could also potentially limit adverse effects related to the use of each agent individually.

The results of the MS316 study showed that the combination therapy of 45 μg/kg/day hGH + rhIGF-1 150 μg/kg/day induced larger height velocity and change in height SDS during three years compared to  hGH  45ug/kg/day  alone.  The  study  did  not  reveal  any  significant  new  safety  signals.  However, occurrence of different adverse events was more frequent in this 'high-dose group'.

This study does not have any impact on the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in its current approved EUindication. Thus, the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in the treatment of  ' For the long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency (Primary IGFD).

Severe Primary IGFD is defined by:

- height standard deviation score   -3.0 and
- basal IGF 1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age and gender and
- GH sufficiency.
- Exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, or chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory steroids.

Severe Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling pathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected to respond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. It is recommended to confirm the diagnosis by conducting an IGF-1 generation test', remains positive.

Finally, Anti-IGF-1 analysis results were not available for all subjects in the study at the time of this report. In subjects with mecasermin treatment 53.8 to 59.3% of the subjects were Anti-IGF-1 antibody positive on year 1 with ca. 25% of the results missing. The meaning of this antibody positivity has not been  discussed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  should  provide  the  final  data  (those  missing  25%  of  the analyses, or an explanation why they were not reported) and discuss the clinical relevance of these findings.

## Recommendation

## Not fulfilled :

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications related to Anti-IGF-1 antibody findings in the study as part of this procedure Submission of study in accordance with Article 46, EMEA/H/C/704/P46 (see section 'Additional clarifications requested').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional clarifications requested

1. Anti-IGF-1 analysis results were not available for all subjects in the study at the time of this report. In  subjects  with  mecasermin  treatment  53.8  to  59.3%  of  the  subjects  were  Anti-IGF-1  antibody positive on year 1 with ca. 25% of the results missing. The meaning of this antibody positivity has not been  discussed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  should  provide  the  final  data  (those  missing  25%  of  the analyses, or an explanation why they were not reported) and discuss the clinical relevance of these findings.

## MAH`s reply to the additional clarifications:

The MAH has provided Final Bioanalytical Report on the determination of Antibody Response to rhIGF-1 in Human  Pediatric Serum Samples of Clinical Study MS316  by using a bridging electrochemoluminescence method.

In total, 523 including 2 backup samples were derived from 105 subjects over 8 different time-points. Each  individual  sample  was  assessed  in  a  confirmatory  assay.  Titer  was  determined  for  96  positive samples containing anti-IGF antibodies.

From the 521 analyzed samples, 96 samples (18.4 %) were found positive after the ECLA confirmatory assay. These positive samples were obtained from 40 different patients. Thus, 40 out of 80 patients assigned  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  groups  receiving  rhIGF-1  (50  %)  had  at  least  one  positive sample for the presence of anti-rhIGF-1 antibodies.

The last sample of this study period, collected on Visit 14, was obtained from 64 different patients. In 9 out of these 64 patients (14.1 %), this last sample was found positive for the presence of anti-rhIGF-1 antibodies.

Binding anti-rhIGF-1 antibody (ADA) development is a common finding during rhIGF-1 treatment and is detected in approximately half of patients during the first year; but it appears to have no effect on response.  In  Ipsen  clinical  studies  MS301,  MS306  and  MS308,  the  percentage  of  patients  who developed binding ADA ranged between 46% and 87%. In this study percentage of patients with at least one positive sample for the presence of anti rhIGF-1 antibodies (50 %) was similar to what has been previously observed. In addition only in 9 out of the 64 patients from whom the last visit sample was  available  this  was  found  positive  showing  that,  in  the  vast  majority  of  the  cases,  antibodies positivity was transient. In these patients the observed growth rate at year 1 was not different from the one observed in the entire efficacy population, further confirming a lack of clinical significance of ADA development on IGF-1 effectiveness.

Among  the  five  patients  who  experienced  a  related  SAE,  one  in  the  rhGH  +  IGF-1  100  μg  group showed also a single sample positive for anti rhIGF-1 antibodies even if the nature of SAE (Intracranial pressure increased) does not have any relation with the antibodies development. Another patient in the same group of treatment, who experienced a related drug hypersensitivity AE that led to patient's withdrawn from the study, showed one single sample positive for anti rhIGF-1 antibodies. No lack of efficacy has been reported.

The MAH concludes that:

- The proportion of patients with at least one positive sample for anti rhIGF-1 antibodies is in the same range of other previously submitted Ipsen studies (MS301, MS306, MS308) and of the published literature mentioned above

- The majority of patients presented transient positivity of anti rhIGF-1 antibodies

- No evidence of relationship between positive results and occurrence of SAEs could be concluded

- No lack of efficacy was reported
- Clinical relevance of development of anti rhIGF-1 seems to be limited and not to have significant impact on efficacy and safety of rhIGF-1 treatment

## Rapporteur's comment on MAH's reply

The  Electrochemiluminiscence  (ECL)  bridging  assay  was  developed  for  detection  of  anti-rhIGF-1  in blood samples of pediatric patients. Briefly, during incubation period of the assay potential anti-rhIGF1  antibodies  bind  both  to  the  SulfoTAG  labeled  rhIGF-1  (reporter)  and  biotinylated-rhIGF-1.  The complexes of anti-rhIGF-1/SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1/biotinylated-rhIGF-1 are captured on streptavidin coated microtiter plates. After washing the unbound biotinylated-rhIGF-1 and SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1 the chemiluminescence  signal  emitted  by  SulfoTag  in  the  anti-rhIGF-1/SulfoTAG-rhIGF-1/biotinylatedrhIGF-1 complexes is measured. The signal is proportional to the quantity of anti-rhIGF-1 antibodies present in  the  samples.  The  plan  for  analytical  testing  of  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  in  paediatric  human serum  samples  using  the  bridging  assay  (screening  method,  confirmatory  assay  and  titration)  was described and endorsed in EMEA/H/C/000704 report dated 21.01.2010. The validation data provided for  the  assay  was  considered  to  demonstrate  its  specificity,  appropriate  sensitivity,  repeatability, precision  and  accuracy.  MAH  had  also  evaluated  all  possibilities  for  assay  interference  providing convincing data.

The modified intent-to-treat population of the study MS316 comprised 105 subjects. According to the original study protocol, anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 8 times during this study.  However, the study  was  prematurely  terminated  after  the  last  subject  attended  Visit  14  (completed  Year  3). Therefore the last assessment was made on Visit 14 and according to the study protocol anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 5 times during this study (not 8 times as MAH states). The MAH is asked to comment on this discrepancy.

The MAH previously presented baseline and Year 1 anti-IGF-1 antibody data from the safety population (106  subjects)  with  ca.  25%  of  the  results  missing.  Now  the  MAH  states  that  521  samples  were derived  from  105  subjects  over  8  different  time-points.  The  MAH  has  not  provided  exact  details informing how many samples were evaluated at 5 (8?) different time points (Visit 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14). Therefore it is impossible to draw any conclusions on whether the results from 521 samples evaluated are really informative regarding the anti-IGF-1 antibody data of the study MS316 or not.

The MAH should provide exact details on how many samples were evaluated on different time points. At the moment it is impossible to know the amount of missing anti-IGF-1 antibody data at different time points.

From the 521 analyzed samples, 96 samples (18.4 %) were found positive from 40 different patients. The MAH states that 40 out of 80 patients assigned to one of the three treatment groups receiving rhIGF-1  (50  %)  had  at  least  one  positive  sample  for  the  presence  of  anti-rhIGF-1  antibodies.  This finding is in in line with previous data on anti-IGF-1 antibodies. Importantly, it seems that majority of patients  has  transient  positivity  of  anti-IGF-1  antibodies  and  there  were  no  relationship  between antibody  positivity  and  occurrence  of  SAE.  In  addition  no  lack  of  efficacy  relating  to  the  antibody positivity was found.

In conclusion, the MAH has provided anti-IGF-1 antibody data from 521 samples analysed from 105 subjects over 8 different time-points. However, the study was prematurely terminated and according to the study protocol anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 5 times during this study (not 8 times as MAH states). In addition, the MAH has not provided exact details informing how many samples were evaluated at 5 (8?) different time points.

It seems that the results of anti-IGF-1 antibodies do not influence the benefit risk balance of Increlex. However, the full analysis of these results is not possible due to multiple discrepancies found in the response provided by the MAH.

The following issues should be clarified:

- 1) According to the original study protocol, anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 8 times during this study.    However,  the  study  was  prematurely  terminated  after  the  last  subject  attended  Visit  14 (completed Year 3). Therefore the last assessment was made on Visit 14 and according to the study protocol anti-IGF-1 antibodies were measured 5 times during this study (not 8 times as MAH states). The MAH is asked to comment on this discrepancy.
- 2) The  MAH has  not  provided  exact  details  informing  how  many  samples  were  evaluated  at  5  (8?) different  time  points  (Visit  2,  5,  8,  11  and  14)  and  the  MAH  should  provide  these  details.    At  the

moment it  is  impossible  to  know  the  amount  of  missing  anti-IGF-1  antibody  data  at  different  time points.

## Recommendation

## MAH's reply to the second list of outstanding issues/ Additional clarifications requested

## Question 1 - Summary of the MAH's response

In the original study protocol, study duration was 3 years and IGF-1 antibody assays were scheduled at visits 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14.

In the Protocol amendment 2 the study was extended to 6 years to provide safety and efficacy data on longer-term use of combination GH and IGF-1 and additional IGF-1 antibody assays were scheduled at visits 17, 20 and 23.

The  study  was  prematurely  terminated  by  the  sponsor,  following  a  review  of  company's  strategies, when the last subject completed visit 14 as foreseen in the original protocol.

Therefore anti-IGF-1 Antibodies assays were performed 5 times according to the original Schedule of Assessment. Consequently, only two samples were collected at visit 17 .

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH states that due to premature termination of the study (last subject completed visit 14) antiIGF-1 Antibodies assays were performed 5 times according to the original Schedule of Assessment.

The MAH`s clarification is acceptable.

## Conclusion

Point is solved.

## Question 2 - Summary of the MAH's response

In this study, 521 samples were analysed for the presence of antibodies to rhIGF-1. The samples were distributed according the following table:

| Visit                         |   V2 (day 1) V5 (week 13) |   V8 (1 year) |   V11 (2 year) |   V14 (3 year) |   V17 (a) |   ET (b) |   ET2 (c) |   Unscheduled |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Number of samples analysed 98 |                       100 |            90 |             81 |             63 |         2 |       27 |        53 |             7 |

(a) 17 patients received treatment during 4 years, some patients performed visit 17 (204 +/- 2 weeks) explaining the two samples at visit 17

(b) Early termination

(c) Early termination Amendment 2

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has clarified the number of samples analysed for the presence of antibodies to rhIGF-1 at different  time  points  according  to  the  study  protocol.  However,  the  MAH  has  not  provided  direct information regarding of number of subjects at each visit vs. number of samples analysed at each visit.

Nevertheless,  according  to  the  study  report  and  MAH`s  clarification  the  number  of  subjects  and analyses at different time points is presented below:

1. At visit 2, 106 subjects were randomized (98 samples measured)
2. At visit 8, 96 subjects completed 1 year (90 samples measured)
3. At visit 11, 85 subjects completed 2 years (81 samples measured)
4. At visit 14, 79 subjects completed 3 years (63 samples measured)
5. Early termination (Amendment 2), 57 subjects (53 samples)

It  seems  that  the  number  of  missing  analyses  is  low  despite  of  visit  14  time  point  (16  missing samples).

It can be concluded that the number of missing samples is not considered to diminish the value of the anti-IGF-1 antibody data from the study MS316.

## Conclusion

Point is solved.
