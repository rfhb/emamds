## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 20140336 is a stand-alone PAM [P46] under Legally binding measure [LEG].

The MAH stated that study 20140336 is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 01/2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

The current study was conducted to fulfill Amgen's commitment to the etelcalcetide Paediatric Investigation Plan agreed with the European Medicines Agency Paediatric Committee in accordance with the Paediatric Regulation in the European Union.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for study 20140336; An Open-label, Single-dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Etelcalcetide (AMG 416) in Paediatric Subjects Aged 2 to less than 18 Years with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) Receiving Maintenance Haemodialysis

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

An Open-label, Single-dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Etelcalcetide (AMG 416) in Paediatric Subjects Aged 2 to less than 18 Years with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) Receiving Maintenance Haemodialysis (study nr: 20140336; EudraCT nr: 2015-005051-28).

## Description

This was an international, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single, intravenous-bolus dose of etelcalcetide in paediatric subjects with secondary HPT receiving haemodialysis.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etelcalcetide after single-dose administration to paediatric subjects 2 to &lt; 18 years of age with secondary HPT receiving maintenance HD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK profile of plasma etelcalcetide, serum iPTH, and serum calcium (total calcium, iCa, and cCa) concentrations after a single IV administration of etelcalcetide.

## Study design

This was a single-arm, open-label, single-dose safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study in approximately 10 paediatric subjects with secondary HPT receiving maintenance haemodialysis. In this study, haemodiafiltration and haemodialysis procedures were considered interchangeable.

On day 1, subjects received a single, IV-bolus administration of 0.035 mg/kg etelcalcetide given into the venous line of the dialysis circuit at the end of haemodialysis. Intensive pharmacodynamic samples were collected predose at screening, on day -2 (baseline), on day 1 at 4 hours postdose, then on days 3, 8, 10, and 30. Intensive pharmacokinetic samples were collected on day -2 (baseline), day 1 at 10 minutes and 4 hours postdose, then on visit days 3 (pre- and post-haemodialysis), 5, 8, 10, and 30 (end-of-study visit). Samples for anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies were collected predose on day -2 (baseline) and postdose on day 30.

Cumulative data from 2 subjects enrolled in cohort 1 were reviewed before enrolling subjects in cohort 2. Subjects with clinically significant adverse events at the end-of-study visit were followed until resolution of the adverse event or until it was considered clinically stable. Any abnormalities in physical examinations after etelcalcetide administration were captured as adverse events.

This study was conducted at 6 centers in the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union.

A safety or data monitoring committee was not established for this study.

After end-of-study visits were completed for 2 subjects enrolled in cohort 1, cumulative study data were reviewed by a team composed of the investigators, Amgen Medical Monitor, Amgen Global Safety Officer (or designee), and additional members as needed (eg, Amgen Clinical Research Study Manager, Biostatistician, Clinical Pharmacologist).

Subjects in this study were 2 to &lt; 18 years of age with CKD and secondary HPT receiving maintenance haemodialysis or haemodiafiltration for &gt; 30 days before screening. Subjects were enrolled into 2 balanced cohorts by age (2 to &lt; 12 years and 12 to &lt; 18 years). These cohorts were consistent with the age categories defined by ICH guidelines for paediatric subjects.

## Study population /Sample size

## Treatments

As this was as open-label study, all subjects received etelcalcetide treatment. Subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on age at screening:

- cohort 1: at least 5 subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age
- cohort 2: at least 5 subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years of age

Etelcalcetide was supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, aqueous solution containing 10 mg etelcalcetide free base, sodium chloride, and succinic acid, in a single-use, 3 mL glass vial. The vial contained 2 mL of clear, colorless, ready-to-administer solution with an etelcalcetide concentration of 5 mg/mL.

The etelcalcetide dose of 0.035 mg/kg selected for this paediatric population corresponded to a 2.5-mg dose for a 70-kg individual, which was half of the 5-mg starting dose given to adult subjects. This weight-based, 2.5-mg dose was the lowest dose studied in adult subjects receiving haemodialysis.

All subjects received a single, IV-bolus dose of 0.035 mg/kg etelcalcetide into the venous line of the dialysis circuit at the end of a haemodialysis session. Etelcalcetide was administered during rinse back to ensure the investigational product reached the systemic circulation.

All doses of etelcalcetide were administered at the research facility by a qualified staff member, under the supervision of a licensed physician. The date, time, volume administered, concentration, and lot number of the investigational product was recorded in the subject's records and on the electronic CRF.

After end-of-study visits were completed for 2 subjects enrolled in cohort 1, cumulative study data were reviewed before initiating enrolment of subjects in cohort 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dosing within the cohort could have been stopped if suspected treatment-related adverse events or changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or clinical laboratory results were observed and posed a significant health risk to the subject.

Investigators could prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoints were common treatment-emergent adverse events (including changes in physical examinations). Also changes in key laboratory safety tests (cCa, phosphorus, potassium, iPTH), ECGs, and vital signs were mentioned as primary.

Secondary endpoints were:

- pharmacodynamics parameters of concentration of serum iPTH, serum calcium (total calcium, iCa, and cCa) over time;
- Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2,z) of etelcalcetide in plasma.
- Anti-etelcalcetide antibodies
- Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events

## Statistical Methods

The safety analysis set was composed of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of etelcalcetide. The pharmacokinetic concentration analysis set was composed of all subjects who received etelcalcetide and had at least 1 pharmacokinetic sample collected.

No formal statistical testing was performed.

Descriptive statistics were provided for selected demographic, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data for all subjects by cohort where appropriate. Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements included number of observations, means, medians, first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3), standard deviations (SD) or standard error (SE), minimum and maximum, while categorical data were summarized using frequency counts and percentages.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

The study was conducted at 6 study centers in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Sixteen subjects were screened and 11 subjects were enrolled into the study. Six subjects were 12 to &lt; 18 years of age and 5 subjects were 2 to &lt; 12 years of age. Overall, 11 subjects completed the study; of these, 6 subjects (100.0%) in cohort 1 and 5 subjects (100.0%) in cohort 2 received 1 dose of etelcalcetide.

One subject in cohort 1 had an important protocol deviation that was listed as incorrect dose of investigational product. The correct dosage of investigational product was believed to have been administered by the investigator, with supportive documentation indicating that the correct dose was administered but could not be confirmed (11 Dec 2018). Pharmacokinetic etelcalcetide concentrations for this subject were within the same range as that observed for other subjects; this subject was not excluded from the analysis.

## Baseline data

Among all subjects (cohort 1 and cohort 2 combined), most were female (54.5%), adolescent (54.5%), and white (81.8%). The mean age for all subjects was 10.3 years. The mean age was 13.5 years for subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years of age (cohort 1) and 6.4 years for subjects 2 to &lt; 12 years of age (cohort 2).

At baseline, 2 subjects (18.2%, 1 in each cohort) reported use of a Vitamin D supplement or active Vitamin D. During the study, 10 subjects (90.9%) reported use of a concomitant medication of interest, most frequently a Vitamin D supplement (81.8%) or a calcium-containing phosphate binder/calcium supplement (63.6%).

## Efficacy results

## Pharmacokinetics

Eighty eight plasma samples, containing dipotassium EDTA, were analyzed with LCMSF method with  a lower  limit  of  quantitation  of  0.200  ng/mL.  The  method  was  validated  over  the  calibration  range between 0.2 0 and 100 ng/mL. 11 subjects received etelcalcetide. Of these samples, 9 (10.2%) were excluded  from  the  plasma  concentration-time  summary  statistics.  All  samples  were  analyzed  within demonstrated long-term storage stability.

After  a  single,  0.035-mg/kg,  IV-bolus  dose  of  etelcalcetide,  the  mean  (SD)  Cmax  was  67.0  (24.0) ng/mL for subjects in cohort 1 (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) and 31.4 (23.8) ng/mL for subjects in cohort 2 (2 to &lt; 12 years of age). Mean (SD) AUCinf was 2700 (1720) hr.ng/mL for subjects in cohort 1 and 955  (533)  hr.ng/mL  for  subjects  in  cohort  2.  Mean  (SD)  AUClast  was  1790  (1360)  hr.ng/mL  for subjects  in  cohort  1  and  839  (397)  hr.ng/mL  for  subjects  in  cohort  2.  Mean  (SD)  t1/2,z  was  5.67 (2.82)  days  for  subjects  in  cohort  1  and  5.85  (2.98)  days  for  subjects  in  cohort  2.  The  results  are shown in Figure and Table below.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Intact Parathyroid Hormone

The median iPTH percent change from baseline at each postdose time point by cohort and for all subjects is summarized in the table below. iPTH percent change from baseline over time by cohort and for all subjects is provided in the figures below.

After a single, IV-bolus dose of 0.035 mg/kg etelcalcetide, reductions in median percent change in serum iPTH concentrations from baseline were observed for all subjects at all postdose time points with the greatest decrease at 4 hours postdose (median change: -45.4%). Concentrations of iPTH returned to near baseline (-7.7% change) at day 8 postdose. Median percent changes in iPTH at 4 hours postdose were -33.4% in cohort 1 and -64.2% in cohort 2 (see table below).

## · Serum calcium

The figures below provide the mean (SE) percent change from baseline in albumin-corrected calcium over time by cohort and for all subjects. Mean (SE) percent change from baseline in ionized calcium over time by cohort and for all subjects are provided in in the figures below.

Mean albumin-corrected calcium for all subjects was &gt; 2.25 mmol/L throughout the study. For all subjects, mean total calcium and albumin-corrected calcium reached postdose nadirs on day 3 (2.39 mmol/L and 2.39 mmol/L, respectively); and the mean ionized calcium nadir was reached at 4 hours postdose (1.11 mmol/L). Mean percent changes from baseline in albumin-corrected calcium of -1.10% and -1.03% were observed at 4 hours postdose and on day 3 (pre-haemodialysis), respectively, for all subjects and returned to approximate baseline levels by end of study.

## · Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Results in All Subjects

After administration of a single, 0.035-mg/kg, IV-bolus dose of etelcalcetide, mean plasma etelcalcetide exposures declined over time, as expected, due to intermittent haemodialysis in subjects with secondary HPT. Median percent reductions in iPTH of -45.4% and -18.2% were observed postdose at 4 hours and on day 3 (pre-haemodialysis), respectively, for all subjects, corresponding with maximum and decreasing etelcalcetide concentrations. Median iPTH levels trended towards baseline levels by day 8 as etelcalcetide concentrations declined. A similar trend and relationship were observed for albumin-corrected calcium concentrations and etelcalcetide concentrations after dosing, with calcium concentrations returning to approximate baseline levels by end of study.

## · Anti-etelcalcetide Antibody Assays

As provided in the table below, a total of 5 of 11 subjects (45.5%) tested positive for anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies; 3 of these subjects tested positive at baseline and end of study (day 30) and 2 of these subjects tested positive at end of study only.

As provided in Table 6, the AUClast value for the 1 subject in cohort 1 who tested positive for antietelcalcetide binding antibodies was numerically lower (948 hr.ng/mL), but within a similar range compared with subjects who tested negative (790 to 4280 hr.ng/mL). The mean AUClast value for the 4 subjects in cohort 2 who tested positive for anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies (824 hr.ng/mL) was similar to the AUClast value for the subject in cohort 2 who tested negative (900 hr.ng/mL). In general, individual concentration-time profiles appeared to be similar between subjects who tested positive for anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies compared with those who tested negative (Figure 10). Descriptive statistics of etelcalcetide concentration data at each time point by binding antibody status is provided in Table 7. Overall, anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies did not appear to affect etelcalcetide AUClast values.

- Treatment related adverse events

Two subjects (18.2%) had an adverse event considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product. Decreased ionized calcium was reported for 1 subject in cohort 1. One subject in cohort 2 reported headache, paresthesia, and vomiting; no adverse events of hypocalcaemia were reported for this subject.

- Events of interest of hypocalcaemia

Events of interest of hypocalcaemia (preferred term: calcium ionized decreased) were reported for 2 subjects (33.3%), both in cohort 1:

- One subject had a nonserious adverse event of grade 2 hypocalcaemia of 4 days' duration beginning on day 1. Ionized calcium was 0.87 mmol/L on day 1 at 4 hours postdose, 1.19 mmol/L on day 3, 1.23 mmol/L on day 8, and 1.19 mmol/L on both visit day 10 and visit day 30. Albumin-corrected calcium was 2.40 mmol/L at 4 hours postdose and &gt; 2.25 mmol/L throughout the study. The adverse event was considered by the investigator to be related to etelcalcetide and resolved without treatment.
- One subject had a nonserious adverse event of grade 1 hypocalcaemia of 6 days' duration beginning on day 3. Ionized calcium was 1.06 mmol/L on day -2, 1.23 mmol/L on day 1 at 4 hours postdose, 1.24 mmol/L on day 3, 1.28 mmol/L on day 8, 1.23 mmol/L on day 10, and 1.24 mmol/L on visit day 30. Albumin-corrected calcium was 2.48 mmol/L on day 3 and &gt; 2.25

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mmol/L throughout the study. The adverse event was considered by the investigator not to be related to etelcalcetide and resolved without treatment.

No other adverse events of interest were reported

## Serious adverse events and deaths

No serious or fatal adverse events were reported.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

As this was a single-dose study, no subject discontinued investigational product due to an adverse event.

## Vital signs

No notable differences were observed for vital signs in either cohort.

## ECG

No notable changes in ECG results were observed between the predose and end-of-study time points for cohort 1, and for cohort 2 with the exception of 1 subject. The maximum increase from baseline to end of study in corrected QT interval for 1 subject in cohort 2 was &gt; 60 msec. For this subject, the corrected QT interval (Fridericia) was 374 msec at baseline and 435 msec at the end-of-study visit; and the corrected QT interval (Bazett) was 380 msec at baseline and 453 msec at the end-of-study visit. On the date (20 October 2017) the end-of-study ECG was recorded, the subject's total calcium and albumin-corrected calcium were both 2.56 mmol/L and the subject's ionized calcium was 1.21 mmol/L. No adverse events were associated with the observation.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Current study has been submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The current study is generally in line with the study commitment as outlined in the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP). The study was an open-label single-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of etelcalcetide in paediatric patients from 2 to less than 18 years of age divided in cohorts &lt;&gt; 12 years with secondary hyperparathyroidism on haemodialysis. Since this study has investigated a single dose of etelcalcetide, the data on safety and efficacy are still of limited value for the clinical situation in which the iPTH is corrected based on multiple dose therapy while managing for appropriate calcium levels based upon dose titration. A multiple dose study is also proposed in the PIP and still pending and thus will likely to be submitted at a later stage.

The study included 6 patients in cohort 1 (12 to &lt;18 years of age) and 5 patients in cohort 2 (2 to &lt; 12 years of age). Mean age was 13.5 (min 12, max 15) and 6.0 (min 3, max 11), although detailed age distribution has not been provided and the cohort 1 is limited in the sense that it did not include patients over 15 years of age. Most patients were White. Gender was differently distributed between the cohorts with more boys included in cohort 1 and far less in cohort 2. Based on the baseline iPTH

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

levels these patients can be regarded as having increased levels, likely associated with secondary PTH disease.

The applicant concluded that although there appeared to be a trend for lower exposures in subjects 2 to  &lt;  12  years  of  age,  given  the  high  inter-subject  variability,  the  extensive  overlap  in  etelcalcetide concentrations,  and  the  limited  number  of  subjects  evaluated,  it  is  unlikely  that  there  were  any clinically  meaningful  differences  in  etelcalcetide  exposures  between  the  age  groups.  Although,  there seems to be a lower exposure in the 2 - 12 years age group, considering the low number of subjects and high variability, no firm conclusion can be made. Moreover, comparison with adult exposure data would have been appreciated.

In addition, the applicant concluded that based on the individual concentration-time profiles, pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide appeared to be similar between subjects who tested positive for antietelcalcetide binding antibodies compared with those who tested negative. However, also in this case no conclusion can be made however considering a very limited number of subjects in different subgroups (1 subject who tested positive and 1 subject who tested negative for anti-etelcalcetide binding antibodies in cohort 1 and 2, respectively).

Overall, regarding the pharmacokinetics, no firm conclusion can be made based upon the single dose data. The pharmacokinetic data do not indicate a concern, however, as indicated, a multiple dose study is ongoing/pending, and these data could be more relevant for the clinical practice.

Results provide some support for the mechanism of action and effects of etelcacletide in paediatric patients with secondary PTH, although this is based on only single dose effects and only descriptive information (absence of a statistical plan) in limited number of patients. A single dose of 0.035 mg/ml equivalent to a 2.5 mg half dose in adults, resulted in instant decrease of mean iPTH, although with considerable inter-variability and a substantial difference between both cohorts (-33% cohort 1, -64% cohort 2 at 4 hours). The effect for the first cohorts appears somewhat less than for adults, however, caution is warranted when directly extrapolating and comparing these data to adults. The limited number of additional time points in this study also limits interpretation in comparison to adult data, in which 6 hours intervals were used and showing return to baseline in 10 to 24 hours in healthy volunteers while the effect remained at least over 65 hours in diseased patients; In this paediatric study the effect returned to normal between 3 and 8 days. In line with the mechanism of action a lowering of serum calcium was also observed.

Due to the lowering calcium effect of etelcalcetide, 1 patient reported a grade 2 adverse event of ionized calcium  4 hours post-dose which was considered to be dose related. Another non-serious decrease in ionized calcium starting on day 3 in another patient was not considered treatment related. Both resolved without treatment. Further data will be awaited from the multiple dose study.

ECG changes are known to be triggered by low calcium levels. It is reported that an event of QT prolongation occurred in one of the patients in cohort 2. Although details on the exact time point of the QT prolongation during the study and the calcium level prior and during the ECG change, this is unlikely to be related to hypocalcaemia as this was not reported in cohort 2. This issue will not be pursued. Further data are awaited from the multiple dose study.

Further, another treatment related adverse event of headache, paresthesia, and vomiting (not related to hypocalcaemia) was reported in cohort 2. These events have all been reported with adults as well (see also SmPC).

In general, as far as safety can properly be assessed based on a single dose, no unexpected safety issues appear and could be acceptable, although a better understanding of safety should come from the PIP proposed multiple dose study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The single dose investigation of etelcalcetide in current submitted study is not of sufficient relevance to inform on the use of etelcalcetide in clinical practice. Currently, no significant issues are observed from an efficacy and safety perspective that currently need to be informed to prescribers. Based on these data the statement included in section 4.2 of the SmPC ''The safety and efficacy of etelcalcetide in children and adolescents less than 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available.'' remains currently applicable. Therefore, it is supported that no changes to the SmPC are proposed. The PIP proposed multiple dose study should provide more clinical relevant data for paediatrics to be able to inform prescribers on the possible use of etelcalcetide in paediatrics.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The single dose investigation of etelcalcetide in current submitted study is not of sufficiently informative and relevant for the use of etelcalcetide in clinical practice. Based on these data the statement included in section 4.2 of the SmPC 'The safety and efficacy of etelcalcetide in children and adolescents less than 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available.' remains currently applicable. Therefore, it is supported that no changes to the SmPC are proposed. The PIP proposed multiple dose study should provide more clinical relevant data for paediatrics to be able to inform prescribers on the possible use of etelcalcetide in paediatrics.
