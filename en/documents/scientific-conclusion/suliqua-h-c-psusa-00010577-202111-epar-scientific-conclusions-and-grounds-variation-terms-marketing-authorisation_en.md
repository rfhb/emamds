## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for insulin glargine / lixisenatide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on delayed gastric emptying from spontaneous reports including a case with close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action for all GLP 1 RA products, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between lixisenatide and delayed gastric emptying is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing insulin glargine/ lixisenatide should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for insulin glargine / lixisenatide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing insulin glargine / lixisenatide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
