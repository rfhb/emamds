## 1. ASSESSMENT

## Introduction

This report covers the submission of the following data from a paediatric study that was commenced under the terms of the PIP but was later abandoned due to poor enrolment:

Article 46 submission of study D-Pan-H1N1-012 (not part of any FUM):

Safety and immunogenicity study of GSK Biologicals' pandemic influenza candidate vaccine (GSK2340272A) in children aged 8 to 12 weeks

This report follows earlier notification to the CHMP that the study was stopped due to lack of willing participants. The current submission consists of: · A cover letter · A short critical expert overview - which the assessor did not find in the package received 12 July 2011 after asking the MAH to send the data directly to the MHRA. Supposedly these data were submitted to EMA in early June such that the clock  was  started  as  on  page  1  of  this report. · The final report on D-Pan H1N1-012, dated 16 May 2011. The study was actually terminated on 25 November 2010. Assessment Study  D-Pan-H1N1-012 was  conducted  at  three  centres  in  Norway  between  November  2009  and November 2010. The study  had  planned  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  two-dose schedule of  HA derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v manufactured in  Dresden in infants aged from 8-12 weeks at the time of the first dose. The study enrolled 8 subjects only. The study had planned to enrol 60 children aged 8 to 12 weeks and of at least 36 weeks gestation at birth, allocated to two parallel vaccine groups with a ratio of 1:1 as follows: -Group A: 30 subjects receiving two primary intramuscular (IM) doses of theA/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like candidate vaccine containing 1.9 µg of haemagglutinin (HA) antigen and AS03B (i.e. half the usual adjuvant dose), according to a 0-28 day schedule. -Group B: 30 subjects receiving two primary IM doses of the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like candidate  vaccine  containing  1.9  μg  of  HA  antigen  and  AS03B,  according  to  a  0-4  month schedule. The injection volume was 0.25 mL. Blood samples were to be taken: -Group A: at Day 0 and Day 56, Month 4 and 11 -Group B: at Day 0 and Day 28, Month 4, 5 and 11 Infanrix-IPV/Hib  and  Prevenar  were  also  administered  but  in  a  staggered  fashion  as  shown  in  the diagram below.
