It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults in Western Europe and in the US. The median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Initially,  most  patients  present  with  asymptomatic  lymphocytosis  and  do  not  need  cytoreductive therapy [Kay, 2002]. Patients with active disease are characterized by a lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months, or progressive, even massive lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, and extreme fatigue are common in advanced disease and can significantly impact quality of life. CLL also causes relative immunosuppression that increases the risk of infections that are ultimately the major cause  of  death  in  this  patient  population.  Median  survival  at  diagnosis  ranges  from  5  to  20+  years depending on risk factors, but is only 6 to 14 months for patients with CLL refractory to available therapies [Tam, 2007]. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The purine analog fludarabine, alone or in combination with other agents, can be considered as the backbone of CLL therapy in both the frontline and subsequent lines of therapy [Rai 2000; Catovsky, 2007]. However, chlorambucil may still be a suitable first-line treatment for elderly patients with CLL [Rai  2000].  Alemtuzumab,  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  the  CD52  antigen which is expressed on the cell surface of both B cells and T cells, has been approved for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate. Recently, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was approved for first-line treatment of patients with CLL  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (January  2009).  Although  most  patients  with  CLL  will achieve  responses  with  initial  therapy,  nearly  all  patients  relapse  and  require  further  treatments. Advanced  age,  more  than  2  prior  therapies  [Wierda,  2005],  and  the  presence  of  chromosomal abnormalities such as 17p and 11q deletions [Dohner, 2000] are associated with decreased response to therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therapy for second and subsequent lines depends on the response and the duration of response to prior therapy. If the duration of response is at least 12 to 18 months, the same regimen can be tried again. If the duration of response is short or lacking, a different therapeutic approach is needed.

For  double-refractory  patients  (DR)  who  no  longer  respond  to  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab,  no established  therapies  are  available.  Patients  with  bulky  (lymphadenopathy  &gt;5  cm)  fludarabinerefractory  CLL  (BFR)  also  have  a  high  unmet  medical  need  because  available  treatment  options appear to be less effective [Fiegl, 2006] and associated with increased toxicity [Perkins, 2002].

Ofatumumab  is  a  human  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1)  that  binds  specifically  to  a  distinct  epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule.  The CD20 molecule is  a  transmembrane  phosphoprotein  expressed  on  B  lymphocytes  from  the  pre-B  to  mature  B lymphocyte stage and on B cell tumours.

Ofatumumab induces cross linking of CD20 molecules and relocation of these CD20 molecules to socalled  lipid  rafts  considered  important  for  induction  of  cell  signalling  and  effective  complement activation. The binding of ofatumumab induces cell death of CD20 positive cells, primarily through complement  dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  and  antibody  dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity (ADCC),  and  less  by  apoptosis.  The  resulting  depletion  of  malignant  B  cells  carrying  the  CD20 epitope  by  ofatumumab  treatment  is  considered  the  main  mechanism  of  action  leading  to  clinical benefit to subjects with CD20-expressing cell tumours. Glaxo Group Ltd applied for a marketing authorisation via the centralised procedure for ofatumumab with  the  invented  name  Arzerra.  The  application  was  made  in  accordance  with  Article  8(3)  of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. The proposed indication was: 'treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia  (CLL)  who  have  failed  therapy  with  a  fludarabine  containing  regimen  and have failed therapy with, or are inappropriate for, an alemtuzumab containing regimen'. The finally approved indication is: 'treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab'. Ofatumumab is designated as an orphan medicinal product in the EU for the indication: 'treatment of chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia'  (EU/3/08/581).    The  Committee  for  Orphan  Medicinal  Products (COMP) concluded that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was estimated to be affecting approximately 3.5 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made (June 2008) and that the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to poor long-term survival in high-risk patients. No paediatric investigation plan was submitted with the application, as ofatumumab is covered by a class waiver on the 'treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', a condition which is not applicable to children. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction The active substance, Ofatumumab, is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD20 and binds specifically to epitopes which encompass the amino residues 163 and 166 in the small extracellular loop of the CD20 molecule epitopes on the human B cells. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Ofatumumab concentrated for solution for infusion, 20 mg/ml is clear, colourless solution filled into Type I clear glass vial sealed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium overseals. Each vial contains 5 ml of ofatumumab.. The medicinal product may contain visible particles and the product is supplied with a commercially available polyether sulfone filter set. The filter set has a CE mark (CE 0086) in compliance with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC.

## Active Substance

The active substance is ofatumumab, an IgG1 k human mAb which is produced from a recombinant murine cell line (NSO). The molecular weight (MW) of the antibody is approximately 149 kDa (25

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

kDa  of  the  light  chain  and  50  kDa  of  the  heavy  chain).  The  antibody  is  N-linked  glycosylated  at ASN302 of the heavy chain with varying amounts of terminal galactose.

##  Manufacture

The manufacturing process starts with the thawing of cells from the NSO working cell bank (WCB). During  the  cell  culture  stages,  cells  are  progressively  increased  in  number,  prior  to  transfer  into  a production bioreactor with controls, which include pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature

When harvest criteria are achieved, the bioreactor contents are clarified prior to further purification. The different steps in the purification process include affinity and anion exchange chromtatography as well  as  robust  viral  clearance  steps  that  are  capable  of  removing  adventitious  agents  and  other contaminants.    Following  purification  the  active  substance  dispensed  into  sterile  active  substance containers prior to testing and release.

Control of materials Comprehensive lists of all materials used during the fermentation and purification of the ofatumumab manufacturing  process  are  given.  Culture  media  are  prepared  from  pre-formulated  base  powders supplemented with chemically defined components. The qualitative composition of the base powders is given. The anti-CD20 antibody expressing murine cell line (SJT26) was generated via transgenic mouse and hybridoma technology. The information provided on generation of the cell substrate is considered to be adequate and sufficiently detailed. Sufficient information is provided on the establishment and testing of MCB and WCB. Testing of the MCB and WCB is acceptable and in accordance with relevant guidelines. MBC Testing -  Characterisation  test  performed  on  the  MCB  includes:  viability,  sterility  by  direct inoculation, mycoplasma by agar and broth culture and Vero indicator cell procedures, Quantitative TEM of sections for the detection of viruses, fungi, yeasts, bacteria and mycoplasma. No infections ecotropic or xenotropic retroviruses were detected. Retrovirus like particle A and C type have  been  detected.  As  is  typical  for  NSO  cell  lines,  a  low  level  of  murine  leukaemia  retrovirus capable of reproducing was detected in the Mus dunni assay, but it was demonstrated to be incapable of infecting the human cell line MRC-5 on co-cultivation with the SJT26 cell line. No other viruses, virus like particles, mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi or yeasts were detected. WCB Testing - WCB were tested for: viability, sterility by direct inoculation, mycoplasma by agar and broth culture and Vero indicator cell procedures. No adventitious viral contaminants were detected. A limit of cell age of 50.0 generations beyond MCB is established. Genetic stability of the cell line has been demonstrated. Based on the results presented, this limit seems acceptable. Process development and validation In general, the ofatumumab active substance manufacturing process is considered well controlled and validated. The process development and establishment of process controls/test are built on the current understanding of the ICH, QbD concept. Information on the risk-matrix system has been provided and the establishment of critical/non-critical process parameters are carefully outlined. The quality system in  place  to  evaluate  derivations  from  Target  Set  Points/Acceptable  range,  Acceptance  Criteria  or  a CCP value outside the acceptable range has been indicated. No design space is claimed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  consistency  study  has  demonstrated  that  the  cell  culture,  harvest  and  purification  process  is routinely operated within predefined acceptance criteria.

Descriptions, supported with detailed tables, have been provided for all changes introduced over time in the ofatumumab active substance manufacturing process at the various process steps. In total three processes have been used, Process A, B and C. The changes introduced from Process A to Process B and  Process  C  have  been  sufficiently  described.  Comparability  with  regard  to  characterization  has overall  been  done  by  state-of  the  art  methods  and  support  that  comparable  ofatumumab  active substance material has been used throughout the non-clinical and clinical studies, and that this material is comparable to the commercial material for the market.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Validation  studies  were  performed  for  the  active  substance,  ofatumumab,  manufacturing  process  to define  the  quality  attributes,  operating  parameters,  control  strategy,  and  to  demonstrate  process consistency.  Following  process  development  and  scale  up,  the  commercial  process  was  established and  a  series  of  three  batches  (39575,  42873  and  45338)  was  run.  Each  batch  was  initiated  from  a separate vial thaw and carried through to active substance.

For each step of the manufacturing process, process parameters that could affect the critical quality attributes  of  active  substance  were  evaluated  and  the  range  for  these  parameters  during  routine manufacturing was established. These ranges were monitored to confirm that they remained within the required limits.

An  initial  assessment  of  the  applicability  of  the  existing  data  (including  experience  with  mAb production  using  murine  cell  lines)  were  done  to  support  set  point  and  ranges  for  each  process parameter.  Data  were  generated  to  justify  process  limits  and  evaluate  the  potential  effect  of  each process parameter on the quality of the product.

A  Critical  Process  Parameter  (CPP)  matrix  is  used  to  evaluate  each  parameter  and  categorize  the magnitude  of  risk  into  three  categories:  high,  medium  and  low,  depending  on  whether  the  process parameter  has  a  high  risk  of  adversely  affecting  the  product  quality,  if  operated  outside  a  defined acceptable range. Process  Limit  Evaluation  (PLE)  studies  were  carried  out  for  parameters  where  the  CPP  risk  was assigned 'high' and where sufficient data did not exist to support the process ranges; therefore, data from  4  to  6  commercial  scale  batches  and  4  to  6  PLE  studies,  using  small  scale  bioreactors,  were analyzed to confirm the acceptable range of the parameter investigated. No CPPs were identified for the 4 steps of the cell culture and harvest process. The  consistency  study  data  has  demonstrated  that  the  cell  culture  and  harvest  process  is  routinely operated within predefined acceptance criteria and that the three consistency lots had comparable cell growth  kinetics,  comparable  ofatumumab  concentrations  and  comparable  purity..  From  the  study  it can be concluded that the ofatumumab active substance batches from the process of consistency series are shown to be comparable to reference standard 31050/ARS. The data presented demonstrate that a consistent quality of ofatumumab active substance is manufactured. Specific  validation  studies  conducted  following  written  protocols  were  used  to  validate  the  active substance  manufacturing  process.  Validation  studies  were  performed  following  production  batch records and standard operating procedures as appropriate. Validation studies were performed using the commercial scale manufacture equipment, or where necessary, in small scale equipment designed to simulate the conditions used at commercial scale manufactures.  Specification The specification and limits proposed by the Applicant for release of ofatumumab active substance is based on data from the manufactured active substance lots and lots used in clinical trials. Tests for purity, potency and identity are included, together with general tests such as appearance and pH and oligosaccharide mapping. All methods have been appropriately validated. A shelf-life specification for ofatumumab has been accepted based on the justification and data given. Medicinal product no longer authorised

##  Stability

The proposed shelf-life of 24 months for ofatumumab when is stored at 5 ± 3 o C protected from light, are acceptable as it is supported with full time; at scale and site, stability data for three batches from the  commercial  Process  C.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  of  the  stability  indicating parameters after storage at this condition, and all results met acceptance criteria.

The results obtained under accelerated (25 o C) conditions for up to 12 months, and under stress (40 o C) conditions  for  up  to  6  months  show  that  the  active  substance  stability  begins  to  decline  at  these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conditions. In addition, data generated following short term exposure to ICH photostability conditions indicates that ofatumumab requires protection from light during storage.

## Medicinal Product

Arzerra (ofatumumab) Concentrate for Solution for Infusion 20 mg/ml is a clear, colourless, aqueous solution containing 20 mg/mL of ofatumumab in a 30 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 100 mM sodium chloride. Prior to administration, the product is diluted into an infusion bag containing isotonic pyrogen free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Water for Injection is an inactive ingredient used as a solvent  for  the  components  of  the  buffer.  During  administration  of  the  intravenous  infusion  the product solution is filtered through an in-line filter.

 Pharmaceutical Development The  development  of  the  formulation  and  the  DP  manufacturing  process  is  considered  adequately described. Excipients and primary container components are considered standard for the product type. All excipients comply with Ph.Eur. and no animal/human on novel excipients are used. All analytical procedures used to control the excipients are in compliance with Ph.Eur. Early formulation development  work  was  performed  by  testing the quality and stability of ofatumumab in a variety of buffer systems over the pH range 4 to 8, suitable for intravenous infusion. The composition of these buffers was based on manufacturing experience of suitable formulation for biopharmaceuticals. The formulations were stored at 5 o C, 25 o C, 40 o C and -20 o C. An aliquot of the samples stored at 5 o C was agitated for 24h on an end over end rotary mixer and tested for aggregate formation. Samples were also tested for purity and potency. Additionally, the formulation samples were checked for visual appearance and presence of particles. The study demonstrated that the sodium citrate buffer was the buffer system that showed best stability of the ofatumumab molecule at 5 o C, 25 o C and 40 o C among the  buffers tested. For the citrate buffer samples,  pH  5.0  had  elevated  levels  of  fragments  on  accelerated  stability  compared  to  the  citrate formulations  at  pH  5.5  or  6.5.  For  these  reasons  and  because  the  30  mM  sodium  citrate,  100  mM sodium chloride, pH 6.5 formulation met all of the design requirements that particular formulation was chosen.  This  formulation  was  used  in  all  clinical  trials  for  CLL  and  is  proposed  for  commercial manufacture. The formulation  choice  has  also  been  validated  by  stability.  The  formulation  maintains  stability  of ofatumumab  when  stored  under  the  recommended  condition.  Besides  biochemical  stability,  the potency of ofatumumab, as measured by the Potency assay is maintained throughout its shelf-life. The Potency assay has been shown to be very sensitive assay to detect changes in ofatumumab activity.  Adventitious Agents The cell banks (MCB and WCB) are sufficiently characterised and tested for adventitious agents. Production bioreactor on day of harvest is routinely tested (in process control) for adventitious viruses. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Four viruses have been included in the virus validation study. A sufficient and acceptable rationale is given for the four viruses used in the virus validation study and virus reduction factor of at least Log 10 &gt; 11 is demonstrated for viruses.

Viral and microbiological safety of the ofatumumab active substance is considered assured.

##  Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  employed  comprises  the  following  process  steps: preparation  of  dilution  buffer,  preparation  of  bulk  solution,  filling,  inspection  and  packaging.  The filling overage has been justified and comparability has been adequately described.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The manufacturing process involves pooling active substance in an appropriate vessel and diluting to the target concentration with a matched buffer solution. After mixing, the solution is filtered through a 0.45 μ m filter and a 0.2 μ m sterile filter into a holding vessel and aseptically filled into vials.

The  critical  steps  of  the  medicinal  product  manufacturing  process  are  controlled  by  the  in-process controls. These in-process controls are described and justified. There are no intermediate products in the manufacturing process.

The representative batch formula is provided for the medicinal product and also for the dilution buffer solution. Three commercial scale batches of medicinal product have been manufactured according to the proposed commercial manufacturing process at the proposed commercial site.

Validation  of  equipment  sterilisation  process,  aseptic  filling  (media  fill,  Tryptone  soya  broth), container closure integrity (microbiological challenge study), filters, re-processing process hold time analysis, has also been performed. The hold time analysis provides a limit for holding product outside of cold storage for a cumulative time that should have no detrimental effect on quality.

The results of accelerated and long-term stability studies for the primary stability batches demonstrate chemical and physical stability  and  equivalence  to  the  supportive  stability  batches  over  the  same  6 months  span.  Stability  data  form  the  supportive  stability  batches  demonstrate  the  overall  quality, purity and potency are retained over 24 months at the recommended storage temperature of 5±3 o C.

 Product Specification The  proposed  list  of  specifications  is  considered  acceptable  and  in  accordance  with  Ph.Eur. 01/2008:2013 'Monoclonal antibodies for human use' and relevant guidelines. No new impurities are formed during manufacture of the medicinal product and the purity/impurity profile for the medicinal product is comparable to active substance. The endotoxin test and the sterility test have been qualified according to Ph.Eur. The  proposed  specification  for  appearance  is:  'Clear,  colourless  liquid.  Visible  particles  may  be present'.  This  is  not  fully  in  accordance  with  Ph.Eur.  monograph  2031  'Monoclonal  antibodies  for human  use',  which  states  that  the  appearance  should  be  'Without  visible  particles'.  However, according to Ph.Eur. monograph 0520 'Parenteral preparations', infusions should be 'Practically free from particles'. It has been demonstrated that the visible particles are product-related protein particles and  there  are  no  changes  in  protein  content.  As  the  product  is  dosed  with  an  in-line  filter,  neither safety nor efficacy is affected by the presence of visible particles. The specification for appearance is therefore considered acceptable. A shelf-life specification has been proposed for the medicinal product. The shelf-life specifications are identical to the release specification. This is considered acceptable as a commitment has been given by GSK to revise the specification 2 years post approval. The medicinal product is supplied in Type I clear glass vials sealed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium overseals. Each vial contains 5 ml of ofatumumab, 20 mg/ml. The vial and stopper are in compliance with Ph.Eur.  Stability of the Product The proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8 o C, protect from light and do not freeze is based on 12 months  stability  data  for  the  primary  batches  and  24  months  data  for  the  supportive  batches. Comparability  of  DP  manufactured  at  different  sites  during  development  is  demonstrated  by  batch analyses data. The proposed medicinal product shelf-life is acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the SPC it is stated that chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at ambient conditions (less than 25 o C). Based on data provided, this is considered acceptable.

GMP Status:  The  sites  used  for  medicinal  product  and  active  substance  manufacture,  release  and stability testing have been inspected and accepted.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Primary pharmacology studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice and a secondary pharmacology  study  was  conducted  to  examine  the  efficacy  of  ofatumumab  in  a  mouse  model  of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Based on cross-reactivity studies and cDNA analysis it was determined that cynomolgus monkey was suitable as test species in the nonclinical safety studies, but not mouse, rat or dog.

Preliminary  toxicology  and  toxicokinetic  studies  were  in  general  performed  in  accordance  with  the principles  of  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP).  All  definitive  toxicology  and  toxicokinetic  studies were performed in full compliance with GLP regulations.

Pharmacology  Primary pharmacodynamics Many  of  the  primary  pharmacology  studies  used  the  commercially  available,  type-I  anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab (Mabthera), as a comparator. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled ofatumumab bound to human peripheral blood mononuclear cell CD20 (3 donors) with a mean EC 50 value of 287±12.7 ng/mL. Similar numbers of iodinated  ofatumumab  and  rituximab  antibodies  bound  to  CD20  on  B-cell  lymphoma  cell  lines,  as shown  by  the  similar  levels  of  binding  saturation.  To  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  iodinated monoclonal  antibodies  bound  via  Fc-receptors,  binding  curves  were  confirmed  using  anti-CD20 F(ab')2 fragments (data not shown). Epitope mapping studies using a mutagenesis approach have indicated that the amino acid residues alanine at position 170 (A170) and proline at position 172 (P172) in the second extracellular loop are critical  for  the  recognition  of  human  CD20  by  known  anti-CD20  antibodies,  including  rituximab [Polyak  2002].  To  determine  which  amino  acids  are  involved  in  ofatumumab  binding  to  CD20, sequential  single  substitutions  of  human  for  mouse  amino  acids  along  the  extracellular  regions  of CD20 have been conducted (site-directed  mutagenesis).  Replacement of  the  amino  acid  residues  at positions 163 and 166 strongly reduced the binding of ofatumumab whereas binding of rituximab was unaffected.  Mutating  threonine  to  lysine  at  position  159  did  not  influence  the  binding  of  either antibody. However, triple mutations at positions 159, 163 and 166 completely abrogated the binding of ofatumumab and reduced the binding of rituximab (data not shown). Ofatumumab and rituximab epitope mapping was also performed in a Pepscan-based ELISA using overlapping, mostly 15-mer synthesized peptides comprising the extracellular loops of CD20. In this study,  ofatumumab bound to peptides N-terminal of A170/P172 in the second extracellular loop of CD20.  It  also  bound  to  peptides  derived  from  the  small  extracellular  CD20  loop.  Rituximab recognised peptides centred around A170/P172 but showed little or no reactivity with peptides located to the N-terminal side of A170/P172 on the large extracellular loop or the small loop of CD20 (data not shown). Cells  from  different  tumour  B-cell  lines  (Daudi,  ARH77,  Raji,  DOHH  and  Su-DHL-4)  were  preincubated with CD20-specific antibodies, before the addition of normal human serum, which induces CDC. Cell lysis was determined by measuring the number of propidium iodide positive cells by flow cytometry. Ofatumumab lysed &gt;80% of cells in all tested cell lines. Rituximab lysed &gt;80% Daudi and Su-DHL-4 cells and between 20-50% of cells in the remaining three cell lines (data not shown). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Complement inhibitors such as CD55 and CD59 appear to play an important role in the susceptibility to  rituximab-induced  CDC  [Golay,  2001].  To  study  the  role  of  CD55  and  CD59  in  anti-CD20 mediated  CDC,  both  complement  inhibitor  molecules  were  blocked  by  specific  antibodies  prior  to induction of CDC. Blocking of CD55 did not affect ofatumumab mediated CDC, while the addition of a CD59 antibody appeared to slightly increase the CDC-mediated lysis. Similarly, the results indicated that blocking of CD59 increased the cells susceptibility to rituximab, while no increase in efficacy was observed following CD55 blocking.

Flow cytometry analysis showed that FITC-conjugated anti-C1q antibody binds to ofatumumab-bound B-cells  to  a  higher  extent  than  rituximab-bound  B-cells.  However,  in  an  ELISA  assay,  human  C1q bound  to  immobilised  ofatumumab  and  rituximab  to  the  same  extent.  Moreover,  fixation  of  C4c

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(indicator  of  complement  activation  via  classical  route)  after  ofatumumab  binding  was  higher  than after rituximab binding. Similar binding of complement factor C3 to ofatumumab and rituximab was observed in an ELISA assay.

In  order  to  investigate  the  impact  of  CD20  expression  levels  on  ofatumumab-induced  CDC, experiments were performed in CD20-transfected human CEM T cells, which lack endogenous CD20 expression. To this end, a panel of CD20-transfected human CEM T cell clones expressing different amounts of CD20 (4500 to 135,000 molecules/cell) was generated. Ofatumumab achieved complete lysis of any cell line expressing more than 60,000 molecules of CD20 and lysed approximately 18% of cells expressing as few as 4500 CD20 molecules/cell. Rituximab did not reach maximal lysis against clones expressing the highest levels of CD20 and showed CDC activity towards cells expressing at least 30,000 CD20 molecules/cell (data not shown).

The induction of CD20 translocation into lipid rafts by anti-CD20 antibodies is considered to be an important mechanism for inducing cell signalling and complement activation [Deans, 1998; Teeling 2004].  It  was  shown  that  both  ofatumumab  and  rituximab  induce  clustering  of  targeted  CD20. Moreover,  based  on  a  series  of in  vitro assays,  it  was  concluded  that  ofatumumab  and  rituximab treatment of Daudi lymphoma cells, induce the clustering of CD20 into lipid rafts to a similar extent (data not shown).

51 Cr-labelled  target  cells,  namely  ARH-77  (a  tumour  B  cell  line),  B  cell  acute  lymphoblastic leukaemia (B ALL) cells after five rounds of subcloning, or fresh tumour B cells from various sources [B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), hairy cell leukaemia, follicular lymphoma and primary mantle  cell  lymphoma],  were  incubated  with  ofatumumab  or  rituximab  (0.01  to  10 μ g/mL). Subsequently, effector cells in the form of polymorphonuclear cells, mononuclear cells or whole blood was added. 51 Cr release was measured using a gamma counter and used as an indicator of target cell lysis.  In  the  presence  of  polymorphonuclear  cells,  minimal  specific  lysis  was  observed  of  ARH-77 cells  and  fresh  tumour  cells.  However,  in  the  presence  of  mononuclear  cells,  ofatumumab  and rituximab mediated lysis of ARH-77 cells, CLL cells, B-ALL cells and hairy cell leukaemia cells to a similar extent, indicating that a similar fraction of cells was susceptible to ADCC by both antibodies. Neither antibody was able to induce ADCC-mediated lysis of follicular lymphoma or primary mantle cell lymphoma cells (data not shown). It was further investigated how the cytotoxic effects of ofatumumab relate to the target occupancy. It was  shown  that  ADCC  induction  reached  its  maximum  level  (51%  lysis)  at  an  ofatumumab concentration  of  about  0.1  g/mL,  which  corresponds  to  the  concentration  at  which  half-maximal target  occupancy was achieved.  In contrast, maximum CDC (68% cell lysis) was only achieved at complete target occupancy (saturation). Induction of apoptosis is an alternative mechanism by which anti-CD20 antibodies could kill tumour B cells [Johnson, 2003]. Therefore the ability of ofatumumab and rituximab (0.1-10 µg/mL) to induce apoptosis  of  Daudi  or  Raji  cells  was  investigated  in  an  Annexin-V  apopotosis  assay.  Neither ofatumumab nor rituximab was able to induce significant apoptosis in Raji  cells.  Around  15%  and 30%  apoptotic Daudi  cells was  seen following incubation with ofatumumab  and  rituximab, respectively.  In  contrast,  the  positive  control  mouse  anti-human  CD20  antibody,  B1,  was  a  strong inducer of apoptosis in both cell lines (data not shown). Homotypic aggregation correlates with the induction of apoptosis [Polyak, 2008], therefore, the ability of ofatumumab to induce homotypic aggregation of Daudi cells was investigated. Light microscopic evaluations  showed  that  ofatumumab  does  not  induce  homotypic  aggregation  of  Daudi  cells,  while rituximab induces minimal cell aggregation. The positive control antibody, B1, was a strong inducer of homotypic aggregation (data not shown). Rapid complement activation has been suggested to underlie the first dose side effects of rituximab due to the release of inflammatory mediators such as the complement split products (anaphylotoxins) C4a,  C3a  and  C5a  [Van  der  Kolk  2001].  Analysis  using  C4a,  C3a,  and  C5a  antibody-coated cytometric beads and flow cytometry showed that ofatumumab had a tendency to induce higher levels of C4a, C3a and C5a during complement activation than rituximab (data not shown).

The  potential  therapeutic  effects  of  ofatumumab in  vivo were  examined  in  severe  combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse tumour xenograft models.

The  first  set  of  experiments  assessed  survival  following  a  high  dose  of  ofatumumab  or  rituximab. SCID mice (n=5/group) were IV inoculated with a human tumour B cell line (2.5 x 10 6 cells)  and 7 days later given vehicle or 100  g of ofatumumab or rituximab by IV bolus injection. Survival was recorded as the end-point of the study. Ofatumumab treatment of mice injected with one of the cell

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lines  resulted  in  60%  survival  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  (100  days  after  the  injection  of  tumour cells).  Rituximab  did  not  prevent  death,  with  the  mice  dying  between  50  to  83  days  after  tumour injection (data not shown).

To investigate the dose-effect relationship, groups of SCID mice (n=4 or 5/group) were injected with 2 x 10 6 cells  of  a  second  B  cell  line  expressing  higher  levels  of  CD20  followed  7  days  later  by  the vehicle or 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 or 20  g of ofatumumab or rituximab. A dose-dependent prolongation of survival was noted following treatment with ofatumumab at  2  g per mouse (~80 µg/kg). Rituximab did not exert a dose-dependent effect on survival (data not shown).

Ofatumumab was subsequently evaluated in studies using a SCID mouse model in which disseminated outgrowth of human B cell tumours was followed by quantitative bioluminescence imaging. In these studies,  2 x 10 6 cells  of  a  B-cell  line  transfected  with  firefly  luciferase  were  injected  IV  into  SCID mice. Several days after cell inoculation, the animals received ofatumumab, rituximab or the isotype control antibody, HuMab-KLH, by IP administration. In an experimental set up in which the animals (n=6/group)  received  a  low  dose  of  antibody  (0.5 mg/kg)  8  days  after  cell  inoculation,  both ofatumumab  and  rituximab  significantly  inhibited  tumour  growth  relative  to  the  control  (data  not shown).

In another experimental set up in which mice (n=9/group) were treated much later (on Day 14), there was  no  difference  in  therapeutic  efficacy  between  ofatumumab  and  rituximab  (0.5  and  50  mg/kg). Ofatumumab and rituximab were also equally effective in mice (n=6/group) administered 0.5 mg/kg on Day 5 or Day 14 (n=6/group). Notably, both antibodies were more effective when administered early after cell inoculation (i.e. on Day 5) than when administered late after inoculation (i.e. on Day 14, data not shown). Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that differences in efficacy between ofatumumab and rituximab, where they occurred, could not be explained by differences in IgG plasma levels. It  was  found  that  ofatumumab  binding  to  CD20  expressing  B-cell  lymphoma  cell  lines  was  not affected  by  deglycosylation.  However,  N-linked  glycosylation  of  ofatumumab  was  essential  for binding  of  C1q  to  the  Fc  portion  of  the  antibody  and  consequently  for  the  ability  to  induce  CDC. Hence, C4 deposition was eliminated following ofatumumab deglycosylation. Moreover, preliminary data  suggested  that  deglycosylation  decreased  Fc  RIIIa-158V  binding  to  ofatumumab.  Binding affinity  of  antibodies  to  Fc γ receptor  IIIa  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  their  potency  to  induce ADCC in vitro [Bleeker 2008; Carter 2006]. Similarly, changing the galactose content of ofatumumab did not affect its binding to CD20 expressing B-cell  lymphoma  cell  lines.  Changing  the  galactose  content  of  ofatumumab  reduced  its  ability  to induce  CDC  in  certain  cell  lines  but  not  in  others.  Moreover,  degalactosylation  of  ofatumumab reduced complement C1q binding and consequently C3 and C4 deposition (data not shown). No difference in anti-tumour efficacy was observed in SCID xenograft mice IP treated with 500  g/kg of ofatumumab or degalactosylated ofatumumab (n=9/group). Hence, the minor non-clinical effect of ofatumumab degalactosylation on CDC and Fc  RIIIa-158V binding (ADCC) did not translate into an in vivo effect on treatment efficacy (data not shown). Based on immunohistochemistry, ofatumumab and rituximab display similar cellular binding (B-cell follicles) in the tonsils of humans and cynomolgus monkeys. In contrast, ofatumumab did not bind to spleen  sections  obtained  from  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  pig  and  dog.  Based  on  flow  cytometry  data, ofatumumab  has  a  slightly  higher  affinity  for  cynomolgus  monkey  than  human  peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (EC 50 values of 139 and 287 ng/mL, respectively). In addition, the cDNA sequence of  the  second  extracellular  loop  of  cynomolgus  monkey  CD20  was  determined  and  the  amino sequence compared to that of human CD20. A single amino acid change was noted at position 158 (Ala human -Val cyno ). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Lipid Rafts Apoptosis SCID mouse tumour model ND = Not determined  Secondary pharmacodynamics In  a  secondary  pharmacology  study,  the  efficacy  of  ofatumumab  in  a  mouse  model  of  rheumatoid arthritis  (RA)  was  examined.  In  patients  with  RA,  large  numbers  of  immune  cells  infiltrate  the hyperplastic  synovial  tissue  of  the  chronically  inflamed  joint,  forming  the  so-called  pannus,  which erodes  subjacent  cartilage and  bone.  According  to  the  applicant, the most  important  of  the autoantibodies  implicated  in  the  condition  are  those  against  cyclic  citrullinated  proteins  (anti-CCP antibodies), which are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. To evaluate the effectiveness of ofatumumab in the depletion of B cells and plasma cells responsible for the production of autoantibodies, SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously with human synovial tissue from patients with RA and intravenously administered 30 mg/kg of anti-KLH (control antibody) or ofatumumab between Days 7 and 9 after engraftment. Mice were implanted with synovium from anti-CCP + or anti-CCP -RA patients. Grafts were explanted at various time points (Days 14, 22, 81 or 91) and stained by immunohistochemistry for B cells and other types of immune cells. Serum levels of human IgG and anti-CPP antibodies were measured by ELISA. Only mice engrafted with tissue from anti-CCP + RA patients developed antibody titers against CCP. In general, there was no effect of ofatumumab on the human IgG titers. The applicant argued that the plasma cells, which are not affected by anti-CD20 antibodies, present at the time of treatment may be responsible for the majority of human antibody production in this model and concluded that assessing human antibody serum levels does not represent a sensitive measurement for B cell depletion in this model.  However,  ofatumumab  efficiently  depleted  B  cells  in  synovial  tissue  in  one  experiment,  in which grafts were explanted early enough (after 14 days) to allow immunohistochemical analysis. A  large  number  of  tissues  from  three  unrelated  patient  donors  were  examined  in  a  human  crossreactivity study. Sections of each sample of tissue from each donor were incubated with FITC-labelled ofatumumab  at  0.5,  5.0  and  20.0 μ g/ml.  All  tissue  samples  were  treated  with  an  antigen  marker appropriate for each tissue in order to confirm the preservation of antigens in that tissue. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Specific, positive, membrane bound staining was recorded in lymphocytes of the lymph node, spleen, thymus and tonsil and also in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the small and large intestines  in  donors  where  lymphoid  tissue  had  been  sampled,  at  all  concentrations  of  the  test antibody.  In  addition  there  was  positive  membrane  bound  staining  of  lymphocytes  scattered  in  the subepithelial  tissue  of  at  least  one  donor  of  cervix,  endometrium,  kidney,  prostate,  parotid  salivary gland, skin, stomach, ureter and urinary bladder at all concentrations of the test antibody.

##  Safety pharmacology programme

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No specific  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  submitted.  However,  some  safety  pharmacology  end points, such as cardiovascular and renal parameters and body temperature, were evaluated as part of the pivotal 4 week and 7 month repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys.

No changes in body temperature were observed in the 4 week repeat-dose toxicity study at doses up to 100 mg/kg. There were no treatment-related changes in heart rate or QT interval in either investigation at doses up to 100 mg/kg.

Urinalysis parameters (volume, specific gravity, pH, protein, blood pigments, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen and bilirubin; microscopic examination of the spun deposit) were evaluated at intervals throughout the 4 week and 7 month studies and showed no changes related to treatment with ofatumumab (see repeat dose toxicity studies).

No studies were submitted. Such investigations were considered by the Applicant as unnecessary, as ofatumumab is a biologic with high specificity and affinity for CD20, and it was felt very unlikely that it would affect other pharmacologically relevant targets. Pharmacokinetics Conventional pharmacokinetic studies are not applicable to monoclonal antibodies like ofatumumab in accordance  with  the  ICH  S6  guideline  on  preclinical  safety  evaluation  of  biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. No  specific pharmacokinetic studies were submitted by the applicant. All pharmacokinetic/ toxicokinetic parameters were obtained as part of repeat dose toxicology studies of up to 7 months duration in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). The majority of studies were performed by the IV route (infusion over 30 minutes) as this is the clinical route of administration; however, the SC route  of  administration  was  also  examined  in  a  single  study.  The  potential  for  the  transfer  of ofatumumab across the placenta was evaluated as part of an embryofetal development study. In terms of analytical methods, different ELISA methods were developed to detect ofatumumab and rituximab in cynomolgus monkey plasma and serum as well as anti-ofatumumab antibodies (data not shown). The pharmacokinetic data obtained during the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys are summarised in the following table 4.

Since  ofatumumab  is  an  antibody,  conventional  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion studies  as  well  as  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  were  not  submitted  (see  discussion  on  nonclinical aspects).

Depletion  of  CD20 + cells  was  not  included  in  the  table  above  as  this  finding  was  considered  a pharmacological effect of ofatumumab. In general, depletion of CD20+ cells in the peripheral blood was detected already after the second administration and seemed to continue throughout the dosing period.  In  the  recovery  animals,  the  time  needed  before  B-cell  levels  returned  to  baseline  levels appeared  to  depend  upon  the  dose,  i.e.  high  dose  animals  recovered  later  than  low  dose  animals. Depletion of CD20 + cells in biopsies taken from the lymph nodes seemed to be consistent with those seen  in  peripheral  blood.  The  depletion  of  CD20 + cells occurred  regardless  of  the  route  of administration (IV versus SC) and whether ofatumumab was administered daily, weekly, monthly or cyclically.

Ofatumumab treatment did not change the pool of other cell phenotypes, including T and NK cells, within the blood or lymph node compartments.  In addition, there were no changes in neutrophil or monocyte populations. Immunisation of monkeys with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) following chronic IV infusion administration of ofatumumab resulted in detectable immune responses, although the  magnitude  of  the  IgG  humoral  immune  response  was  reduced  in  monkeys  dosed  at  20  and 100 mg/kg.  No effects on delayed type hypersensitivity reactions were noted at doses of ofatumumab up to and including 100 mg/kg (as assessed by immunisation with commercially available antigens, i.e., diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mix).

No studies on fertility and no peri- and post-natal toxicology studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Increases  in  reticulocytes  and  lactate  dehydrogenase,  and  decreases  in  haemoglobin  concentration, haematocrit concentration and red blood cell count were indicative of haemolytic anaemia. A review of  haemolytic  events  indicated  that  the  majority  of  treated  animals  were  experiencing  a  slowly developing  haemolytic  anaemia  during  both  the  dosing  and  recovery  periods,  and  that  this  was associated  with  a  progressive,  dose-related  increase  in  lactate  dehydrogenase  that  was  reversible. Furthermore,  the  direct  Coombs'  test  results  suggested  that  the  monkeys  probably  developed antibodies  to  ofatumumab,  which  induced  the  formation  of  immune  complexes  and  complement activation and was followed by binding of the complexes via the complement binding CR1 receptor to the  surface  of  the  red  blood  cells.    This  is  likely  to  have  resulted  in  sequestration  in  the  spleen  by macrophages leading to haemolytic anaemia. The cynomolgus monkey red blood cell surface contains approximately 7 times the number of CR1 epitopes found on human red blood cells [Edberg, 1992; Hebert,  1992],  and  according  to  the  applicant  this  may  have  accentuated  the  observed  haemolytic anaemia in the cynomolgus monkeys. In  the  pivotal  7  month  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (GLP),  there  were  five  monkeys  that  were  either humanely  sacrificed  or  found  dead  at  both  dose  levels,  none  of  these  were  attributable  to  direct toxicity of the test item. The reasons for animal withdrawal can be categorised into those which had a probable Campylobacter  jejuni ( C.  jejuni )  infection  and  those  which  showed  signs  of  haemolytic anaemia.  Genotoxicity No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  Carcinogenicity No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  Reproduction Toxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  an  embryofoetal  development  study,  ofatumumab  was  administered  iv  to  pregnant  cynomolgus monkeys from day 20 to 50 of gestation (period of organogenesis). The animals received 0, 20 or 100 mg/kg once weekly (i.e. a total of 5 administrations). Foetuses were delivered via caesarean section and euthanized on day 100 ± 1 of gestation.

There were no unscheduled deaths during the study. The incidence of prenatal loss was also unaffected by  treatment.  No  treatment-related  effect  was  detected  in  pregnant  females  with  respect  to  clinical observations,  weight  or  haematology.  A  significant  and  almost  complete  depletion  of  peripheral CD20/CD40-positive B-cells was observed in all ofatumumab-treated dams at day 25 post coitum (the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

earliest time point evaluated after dosing). Following the recovery period, the depletion of B-cells was still present.

There were no ofatumumab-related changes in fetal body weights or dimensions, placental weights, or foetal abnormalities. A reduction in spleen weights was observed for foetuses in the 100 mg/kg dose group,  but  no  correlating  microscopic  changes  were  noted.  A  decrease  in  B cells  was  observed  in foetal cord blood collected from the foetuses of animals in both dose groups, and B cell-depletion was noted in splenic tissue from the foetuses.

Ofatumumab was present in maternal plasma up to Gestation Day 100 and was also detectable in 17 of 20 umbilical cord blood samples from the foetuses, confirming exposure to ofatumumab during late pregnancy (GD100). The mean plasma AUC value for maternal ofatumumab exposure was 1646000 µg*h/mL. Antibodies against ofatumumab were detected in 3 of 24 female monkeys (2 of 12 animals dosed at 20 mg/kg and 1 of 12 animals dosed at 100 mg/kg). Moreover, anti-ofatumumab antibodies were detected in 3 of 24 dams and in 3 of 20 fetal cord blood samples.

##  Local tolerance

No  separate  studies  assessing  local  tolerance  to  ofatumumab  were  submitted  as  macroscopic  or microscopic examinations of the injection sites were conducted following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of ofatumumab to cynomolgus monkeys as part of the repeat dose toxicology studies. No macroscopic of microscopic findings of local irritation were noted in any of these investigations.

##  Other toxicity studies

Immunotoxicity. The  activation and  release  of  inflammatory  and  coagulation  parameters  was investigated following administration of ofatumumab to cynomolgus monkeys (GMB-3001-013). The blood samples used in this study were derived from the pilot dose-ranging toxicity study, in which cynomolgus monkeys (1 male or female per group) were given ofatumumab by intravenous infusion (30 minutes) at doses of 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/kg on Day 1 (23315). Serum samples were taken prior to dosing and at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-dose, and the levels of complement factors  C3b/c  and  C4b/c,  thrombin-anti-thrombin  III  complex  (TAT),  plasmin  2-anti-plasmin complex  (PAP),  interleukin-6  (IL-6),  elastase- 1-antitrypsin  complex  (HNE/ATc,  a  marker  for neutrophil  degranulation),  and  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF  )  were  determined  using  ELISA assays. An increase of C3b/c (activated form of C3) was noted in all monkeys at 15 minutes post-dose, but 2 to  4 hours  later  the  level  of  C3b/c  had  decreased.  C4b/c  (activated  form  of  C4)  showed  a  similar increase following ofatumumab administration. TAT complex levels in the circulation increased in all monkeys at 15 minutes post-dose, but the increase was variable with the monkey treated at 50 mg/kg showing the greatest increase. PAP levels in the circulation increased in all animals but in 3 out of 4 animals, plasmin formation was transient. Neutrophil degranulation was observed in 3 of 4 animals, but the increase was very mild in the 25 mg/kg dose group. IL-6, one of the cytokines that increases most in humans under inflammatory conditions, appeared to follow a biphasic course, with the early increase possibly related to complement activation and the later increase to cellular activation. TNF  levels were measured but were below the limit of detection. These results suggest that administration of  ofatumumab  may  be  associated  with  cytokine  release  syndrome.  However,  the  severity  of  this syndrome in the monkeys was limited and clinical manifestations were not observed. Immunogenicity. The formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies was investigated as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies and the embryofetal development study by the use of two ELISA assays. ADAs were detected in all of the studies  where analyses  were undertaken following both intravenous and subcutaneous dosing (data not shown, see discussion of non-clinical aspects). Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No environmental risk assessment was submitted (see discussion of non-clinical aspects). Discussion on the non-clinical aspects In vitro binding studies indicated the specific binding of ofatumumab to CD20 and that ofatumumab binds to a CD20 epitope somewhat overlapping and somewhat distinct from that of rituximab. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Further in vitro experiments investigated the mechanisms of ofatumumab cytotoxicity and suggested that  CDC  and  ADCC,  but  not  apoptosis,  mediate  the  cytotoxic  effect.  Generation  of  complement activation  products  (anaphylotoxins)  and  translocation  of  CD20  into  lipid  rafts,  but  not  homotypic aggregation  of  B-cell  line  cells,  were  induced  by  ofatumumab.  In  vivo,  ofatumumab  was  able  to protect SCID mice from implanted B-cell line tumours.

Since ofatumumab is a biotechnology-derived product with highly specific receptor targeting, it was considered  sufficient  that  safety  pharmacology  endpoints  were  evaluated  as  part  of  the  toxicology studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  no  formal  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  Arzerra,  there  are  no  known clinically significant interactions with other medicinal products. Live attenuated or inactivated vaccine efficacy may be impaired with ofatumumab (see Discussion on Clinical Safety).

It  has  been described in the literature that statin (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor) treatment decreases CD20  epitope  accessibility  due  to  cholesterol  depletion  and  this  can  lead  to  reduced  binding  and activity of ofatumumab [Golab, 2007]. Monitoring of the potential for drug-drug interactions between ofatumumab and anti-hypercholesterolemic drugs such as statins is included in the Risk Management Plan (See section 3.5 Pharmacovigilance).

An  ELISA  was  used  for  the  quantification  of  ofatumumab  in  monkey  serum  and  plasma.  For  the detection of anti-ofatumumab antibodies in monkeys  administered with ofatumumab,  several approaches  were  undertaken.  Two  ELISA  methods  were  used  in  most  studies;  the  F(ab')2  binding antibody  preclinical  assay  and  the  whole  ofatumumab  binding  antibody  preclinical  assay.  For  both assays several concerns were raised regarding the design and the validation of the methods, especially since the presence of ofatumumab seems to interfere with the detection of anti-ofatumumab antibodies even at low concentrations. The applicant did not provide adequate answers to these concerns. Thus, the  results  from  the  toxicity  studies  monitoring  anti-ofatumumab  antibodies  and  serum  levels  of ofatumumab should be interpreted with caution. In accordance with the ICH S6 guideline, the lack of metabolism and excretion studies is acceptable. The lack of distribution studies is justified by 1) the fact that ofatumumab targets the CD20 molecule, whose tissue expression is characterized 2) the fact that toxicokinetic data indicate limited distribution beyond the plasma compartment and 3) the human cross-reactivity study indicates no potential for offtarget binding. The lack of single-dose toxicity studies is acceptable in accordance with the concept paper on single dose/acute toxicity (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/302413/2008). In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  haemolytic  anaemia  developed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  leading  to unscheduled deaths. The Applicant ascribed the development of the haemolytic anaemia to formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies, but this remains speculative and a potential clinical relevance cannot be excluded. Haemolytic anaemia has been included as a potential risk in the RMP. Although no thromboembolic events have been reported in the monkey studies, increased thrombinanti-thrombin / plasmin-anti-plasmin ratios were observed, indicating that ofatumumab may constitute a risk for thromboembolic complications. However, a plausible explanation for the observed effects is a mild, infusion related response without effects on the coagulation system, as apparent by unchanged platelet  counts.  The  data  presented  do  not  indicate  an  increased  risk  of  procoagulating  events following  the  use  of  ofatumumab.  Since  thromboembolic  events  will  be  monitored  through  routine pharmacovigilance  activities,  and  since  cardiovascular  effects  are  an  identified  risk  of  ofatumumab (included in the proposed Risk Management Plan), this is considered acceptable.

The  lack  of  genotoxicity  studies  is  considered  justified  according  to  ICH  S6,  while  the  Applicant justified the lack of carcinogenicity studies by claiming that 1) ofatumumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, 2) ofatumumab is not pharmacologically active in rodents and so the standard carcinogenicity bioassays are unsuitable, 3) there is no scientific evidence to  suggest  that  depletion  of  B  cells  by  any  other  anti-CD20  therapeutics  leads  to  cancer,  and  4) populations  of  NK  cells,  which  are  central  to  immune  surveillance,  did  not  change  during  pivotal repeat  dose  studies  of  up  to  7  months  duration.  The  justification  for  not  submitting  carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable and the lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data is described in section 5.3 of the SPC.

Considering that the median survival of CLL patients is 10 years, an evaluation of fertility as well as pre-  and  post-natal  development  could  theoretically  be  relevant.  However,  it  was  considered acceptable that fertility and pre- and post natal development studies were not submitted due to 1) the lack of ofatumumab off-target binding, 2) the lack of CD20 expression in reproductive tissues, 3) the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fact that antibodies does not appear to be able to cross the healthy blood-testis barrier, 4) the lack of a role for B-cells in organ system development, 5) the age of the patient population (median age of 65 to 70 years old), and 6) the lack of ofatumumab affinity for CD20 in rodents and rabbits. The lack of animal (and human) fertility data is reflected in section 4.6 of the SPC.

No maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity was observed following IV administration of up to 100 mg/kg ofatumumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once weekly from day 20 to 50 of gestation. The mean maternal plasma exposure corresponds to 2.4-fold the clinical exposure following administration of 2 gram ofatumumab. As expected, ofatumumab induced nearly complete B-cell depletion in the pregnant females. Moreover, a decrease in B cells was observed in foetal cord blood collected from the foetuses of animals in both dose groups, and B cell-depletion was noted  in  splenic  tissue  from  the  foetuses.  These  data  and  relevant  warnings  on  pregnancy  (and lactation) are included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC.

## GCP

The results of the immunogenicity analyses should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the detection  methods  (ELISA  assays).  Moreover,  it  is  agreed  that  formation  of  primate  anti-human antibodies (PAHAs) is not predictive of the immunogenicity of the human antibody in patients. As mentioned above, the potential of PAHAs to have induced the haemolytic anaemia observed in the repeat-dose dose toxicity studies remains speculative, but monitoring of haemolytic anaemia has been included in the Risk Management Plan. As  a  protein,  ofatumumab  is  exempted  under  current  guidance  from  the  need  for  a  detailed environmental assessment. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction The clinical documentation submitted in support of this application comprises primarily data from a pre-planned  interim  analysis  of  a  single  arm,  open-label,  multi-center  ongoing  pivotal  study,  HxCD20-406. Additional supportive evidence is provided by a phase I/II study, Hx-CD20-402. The proposed indication was: 'treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have  failed  therapy  with  a  fludarabine  containing  regimen  and  have  failed  therapy  with,  or  are inappropriate for, an alemtuzumab containing regimen'. The finally approved indication is: 'treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab'. The recommended dose is 300 mg Arzerra for the first infusion and 2000 mg Arzerra for all subsequent infusions.  The  infusion  schedule  is  8 consecutive  weekly  infusions,  followed  4-5 weeks  later  by 4 consecutive  monthly  (i.e.  every  4 weeks)  infusions.  Dosing  recommendations  on  first  and  second infusions, subsequent infusions, dose modification, reinitiation of therapy, and recommendations about special populations are described in the SPC (see Section 4.2). A paediatric class waiver for CLL was issued on 14 July 2008 -confirmation number EMEA/18/2008 Arzerra  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  below  18  years  due  to  insufficient  data  on  safety and/or efficacy. No studies in special populations, such as elderly, males/females or ethnic groups were submitted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  pivotal  study  HX-CD20-406  and  the  supportive  study  HX-CD20-402  are  stated  to  have  been conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics  were  assessed  in  the  course  of  the  efficacy/safety  studies  supporting  the  current application  as  well  as  the  development  of  ofatumumab  in  other  indications.  A  total  of  six  clinical studies  with  pharmacokinetics  objectives  and  endpoints  were  submitted,  with  433  subject  receiving ofatumumab  (Table  7).  Moreover,  a  population  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  analysis  and  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cross-study analysis of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were made using data from studies 001, 402, 403 Part A and B and 406. In the former analysis, data from study 406 were only available for 53 patients, compared to 129 patients in the latter analysis.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a so called sandwich immuno-assay, was used for the  quantification  of  ofatumumab  in  human  serum.  Several  approaches  were  used  to  establish  a method to monitor the development of anti-ofatumumab antibodies in patients, but only two ELISA assays  were  used  to  test  samples  from  the  clinical  trials.  The  difference  between  the  two  is  the specificity  of  the  anti-ofatumubab  antibody  molecule  detected.  In  the  so  called  F(ab')2  binding antibody  clinical  assay,  only  antibodies  against  the  antigen-binding  region  or  F(ab')2  fragment  of ofatumumab  are  detected,  while  the  whole  ofatumumab  binding  antibody  clinical  assay  detects antibodies against any portion of the ofatumumab molecule. The latter was used in the pivotal efficacy study Hx-CD20-406.

##  Absorption

Ofatumumab is administered by intravenous infusion. Maximum ofatumumab serum concentrations were generally observed at or shortly after the end of the infusion. In the pivotal efficacy trial (Study Hx-CD20-406),  pharmacokinetic  data  were  available  from  146 patients  with  refractory  CLL.    The geometric  mean C max value  was  63  g/ml  after  the  first  infusion  (300 mg);  after  the  eighth  weekly infusion (seventh infusion of 2000 mg), the geometric mean C max value was 1482  g/ml and geometric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean  AUC(0- ) value  was  674,463  g.h/ml;  after  the  twelfth  infusion  (fourth  monthly  infusion; 2000 mg),  the  geometric  mean  C max value  was  881  g/ml  and  geometric  mean  AUC (0- ) was 265,707  g.h/ml.

##  Distribution

Ofatumumab had a small volume of distribution (geometric mean Vss values ranged from 1.7 to 5.1 L across  studies,  dose  levels,  and  infusion  number.  This  is  consistent  with  distribution  largely  in  the systemic circulation.

##  Elimination

| no   |
|------|

Mean AUC(0-∞ )  and Cmax after the first dose of ofatumumab, as well as mean AUC(0-∞ ) /dose and mean Cmax/dose, plotted against dose, is presented in Figure 1. As seen in the figure, mean Cmax and AUC ( 0-∞ ) values for ofatumumab after the first dose seem to increase by dose more than expected in most studies.

Ofatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-independent route as with other IgG molecules and a target-mediated route which is related to binding to B cells. There  was  a  rapid  and  sustained  depletion  of  CD20+  B  cells  after  the  first  ofatumumab  infusion, leaving a reduced number of CD20+ cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions. As a result,  ofatumumab  clearance  values  were  lower  and  t½  values  were  significantly  larger  after later infusions than after the initial infusion. Clearance and half-life values from the two studies in subjects with CLL are presented in Table 8. Half-life values increased from 1.3 days after the first infusion to 15.8 days after the eighth infusion and 13.9 days after the twelfth infusion. Table 8: Clearance and Half-life Values for ofatumumab after infusion in subjects with CLL (Study Hx-CD20-402 and Study Hx-CD20-406) Ofatumumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and  individual  amino  acids  by  ubiquitous  proteolytic  enzymes  [Dempster,  2000].  The  non-target mediated clearance of ofatumumab is likely to be largely mediated by proteolysis.  Dose proportionality and time dependencies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Baseline  calculated  creatinine  clearance  was  not  found  to  be  a  clinically  significant  factor  on ofatumumab  pharmacokinetics  in  a  cross-study  population  analysis  in  patients  with  calculated creatinine clearance values ranging from 33 to 287 ml/min.  No dose adjustment is recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min).  There are no pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min).

During repeated weekly infusions, ofatumumab AUC(0-∞ ) and Cmax values increased more than the expected accumulation based on first infusion data, as also described under 'Absorption' above.  Special populations No studies specifically addressing pharmacokinetics in special populations were submitted. However, pharmacokinetic differences in special populations were explored in the population pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic analysis and in the cross-study analysis of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics based on data from studies 001, 402, 403 Part A and B and 406. In these analyses, the effect of body measures (weight, body surface area) on pharmacokinetic parameters was modest (data not shown). Age  was  not  found  to  be  a  significant  factor  on  ofatumumab  pharmacokinetics  in  a  cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients ranging in age from 21 to 86 years of age. Gender had a modest effect (14-25%) on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in a cross-study analysis, with higher C max and AUC values observed in female patients (41% of the patients in this analysis were male  and  59%  were  female);  these  effects  are  not  considered  clinically  relevant,  and  no  dose adjustment is recommended.

The potential influence of race was not assessed.

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment.  IgG1 molecules such as ofatumumab are  catabolised  by  ubiquitous  proteolytic  enzymes,  which  are  not  restricted  to  hepatic tissue;  therefore,  changes  in  hepatic  function  are  unlikely  to  have  any  effect  on  the  elimination  of ofatumumab.

## Pharmacodynamics

<!-- image -->

No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of ofatumumab action were submitted.  Primary and Secondary pharmacology Primary and secondary pharmacology parameters were measured in the course of the efficacy/safety/PK studies which are summarised in Table 7. In the following, results from the pivotal CLL study (Hx-CD20-406) are described, but references are also made to studies, 001, 402, 403A and 403B. CD19+ B-cell counts were determined before, during, and after ofatumumab therapy to assess B-cell depletion. The B-cell surface antigen CD19 was used as a marker for CD20, because the two antigens have a similar  expression  profile  on  B  cells  and  the  presence  of  an  anti-CD20  antibody  binding  to CD20+ cells can interfere with the flow cytometric measurement of CD20+ cells. There  was  a  rapid  and  sustained  depletion  of  CD20+  B  cells  after  the  first  ofatumumab  infusion, leaving a reduced number of CD20+ cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions (see Figure 2). In subjects with refractory CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406, the median decrease in B-cell counts  was  23%  after  the  first  infusion  (300  mg)  and  92%  after  the  eighth  infusion  (2000  mg). Peripheral B-cell counts remained low throughout therapy in most subjects and gradually increased after the end of ofatumumab therapy, with the median decrease in B-cell counts remaining 68% below baseline three months after the last infusion.

In  general,  serum  IgG  and  IgA  concentrations  were  stable  during  the  studies,  and  serum  IgM concentrations  declined,  consistent  with  long-term  B-cell  depletion;  in  Study  Hx-CD20-406  (CLL), there  appeared to be a modest decrease in mean IgG concentrations from baseline to Week 16. No clinically  significant  changes  in  serum  complement  levels,  T-cell  counts,  or  NK-cell  counts  were observed in the studies (data not shown). Medicinal product no longer authorised

There did not appear to be a relationship between ofatumumab dose and the incidence of infection across the studies. In the placebo-controlled studies of ofatumumab in subjects with RA (Study 403 Part A and Part B), similar infection rates were observed in placebo subjects and in subjects receiving ofatumumab at all three active dose levels. In subjects with CLL, no relationship was seen between ofatumumab pharmacokinetics and occurrence of infections in study 402. In study 406 (CLL) longer time to first major infection (defined as infections requiring at least 48 h hospitalization that occurred during or within four weeks of completing treatment) was correlated with higher AUC(0-∞ ) and Cmin values at the eighth infusion (data not shown).

Anti-ofatumumab antibodies were detected in only two samples out of the 274 subjects who received ofatumumab in studies 001, 402, 403 Part A and B. However, conclusions regarding these results are limited because the assay used to measure anti-ofatumumab antibodies was not capable of detecting antibodies to all ofatumumab domains (F(ab')2 binding antibody clinical assay). An assay which can detect antibodies to any epitope on ofatumumab was subsequently developed and is being used to test for anti-ofatumumab antibodies in ongoing study 406. In the 46 subjects who received at least eight infusions and for whom data have been generated at ofatumumab concentrations &lt;500 ng/ml (33 of whom received all twelve infusions), there have been no positive samples (see SPC section 5.1). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

positive  result  in  the  subject  in  study  403  Part  B  was  not  confirmed  using  the  whole  ofatumumab binding antibody clinical assay.

In  study  402  (CLL),  statistically  significant  associations  were  seen  between  objective  response  and ofatumumab  exposure  after  the  fourth  infusion  (241%  higher  AUC,  43%  higher  Cmax,  and  94% higher Cmin values in subjects who responded compared to those who did not respond); higher AUC values  were  associated  with  longer  duration  of  response,  delayed  time  to  progression,  and  delayed time  to  next  anti-CLL  therapy  (data  not  shown).  In  study  406  (CLL),  ofatumumab  exposure  was higher at the eighth infusion (last weekly infusion) in subjects who responded (37% higher AUC, 23% higher  Cmax,  and  91%  higher  Cmin  values)  than  in  subjects  who  did  not  respond,  as  assessed  by objective  response  from  screening  to  Week  24;  however,  there  was  substantial  overlap  in  exposure values between subjects who responded and who did not respond. No differences in exposure were seen at the twelfth infusion (last monthly infusion) between subjects who responded and subjects who did not respond. Longer progression-free survival was associated with higher exposure (AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values) at both the eighth and twelfth infusions (data not shown). Finally, there was little apparent relationship between differences in ofatumumab exposure and clinical response in study 001 (FL) or study 403 Part A (RA). In study 403 Part B (RA), subjects who responded at Week 24 had higher ofatumumab exposures (data not shown).

Discussion on clinical pharmacological aspects As also mentioned in the discussion of non-clinical aspects, several concerns were raised concerning the  design  and  validation  of  the  ELISA  used  to  measure  ofatumumab  and  the  two  ELISA  methods used to detect and quantify anti-ofatumumab antibodies. These concerns have not been fully resolved by the applicant's responses. Anti-ofatumumab antibodies in ongoing and future studies should solely be monitored with the so called whole ofatumumab binding assay that seems capable of giving a more correct picture of the production of antibodies when patients are administered ofatumumab. Ofatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-independent route like other IgG  molecules and a target-mediated route which is related to binding to B cells.  There was a rapid and sustained depletion of  CD20 + B  cells  after  the  first  ofatumumab  infusion,  leaving  a  reduced  number  of  CD20 + cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions.  As a result, ofatumumab clearance values were lower and t ½ values were significantly larger after later infusions than after the initial infusion; during  repeated  weekly  infusions,  ofatumumab  AUC  and  C max values  increased  more  than  the expected accumulation based on first infusion data. No significant effect of impaired renal function, gender, age, and body measures (height, weight, body surface area) on pharmacokinetic parameters was found. The potential influence of impaired hepatic function and race was not assessed. Missing pharmacokinetic information in children and adolescents, in severe renal impairment and in hepatic impairment is reflected in the SPC. No  drug  interaction  studies  were  submitted.  As  stated  in  the  EMEA  'Guideline  on  the  clinical investigation of the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins' (EMEA/CHMP/89249/2004): 'Interaction  studies  should  be  considered  (…)  when  suppression  of  the  immunological  system  is likely.'  An example of the latter is methotrexate, which significantly decreases the clearance of coadministered  antibodies.'  The  potential  interaction  with  methotrexate  will  be  investigated  by  the Applicant in ongoing clinical studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

CD19+ B-cell  counts  were  used  to  assess  B-cell  depletion,  the  B-cell  surface  antigen  CD19  being considered  as  a  marker  for  CD20.  In  the  dose-finding  study  in  patients  with  CLL  (Hx-CD20-402), there were only three patients in each of the two lower dose groups, thus the evidence supporting the selected dose of the applied posology seems weak.

There was a significant drop in the IgM concentrations and a slight decrease in IgG concentrations after  initiation  of  ofatumumab  therapy.  However,  the  changes  did  not  result  in  increased  risk  of infections.  The  changes  observed  therefore  do  not  give  rise  to  immediate  concern.  However,  these findings and plans to monitor this potential side effect prospectively have been included in the risk management plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall immunogenicity risk assessment for ofatumumab seems to be low. However, conclusions regarding these results are limited because the assay used to measure anti-ofatumumab antibodies in most studies was restricted to detection of antibodies of just one isotype (IgG1) and was not capable of detecting antibodies to CH2 and CH3 domains. Immunogenicity data from clinical trials are described in section 5.1 of the SPC. Immunogenicity is also listed as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan and actions to monitor the risk of treatment failure and risk of adverse reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) based on immunogenicity are described.

The relationship between plasma ofatumumab concentration and pharmacodynamic effect is complex and its interpretation is not straightforward. Higher exposures may result in more tumour reduction; however,  lower  or  reduced  tumour  burden  will  result  in  reduced  clearance  and  therefore  higher exposures.

-  Dose response study

Clinical efficacy The primary evidence of the efficacy of ofatumumab is provided by the results of the interim analysis of  the  ongoing  pivotal  study  Hx-CD20-406.    In  addition,  efficacy  results  from  one  completed supportive  study,  Hx-CD20-402  are  provided.    The  number  of  subjects  treated  in  these  studies  is summarized in the table below. Table 9: Summary of ofatumumab efficacy studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Thirty-three subjects were enrolled into the Hx-CD20-402 dose-escalation study. Patients received 4 weekly infusions of ofatumumab:

Group A (n=3) received a first infusion of 100 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 500 mg Group B (n=3) received a first infusion of 300 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 1000 mg Group C (n=27) received a first infusion of 500 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 2000 mg. The absolute doses applied in the current study were selected based on previous studies with rituximab in FL and CLL, and on previous experience with ofatumumab in FL patients. One subject in Group C was withdrawn from treatment after the first infusion due to an SAE of cytolytic hepatitis (elevation of transaminases,  maximal  CTC  Grade  3),  considered  related  to  study  medication.    Subjects  had  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

median age of 61 years, ranging from 27 to 82 years, and 42% of subjects were female.  All subjects were Caucasian.  Most subjects were in the low or intermediate risk stage of their disease with Rai Stage I or II (39% and 45%), or Binet Stage A or B (21% and 67%), respectively.  No subjects in Group A or Group B had constitutional symptoms.  In Group C, 6% of subjects experienced extreme fatigue  and  15%  experienced  night  sweats.    The  median  number  of  prior  CLL  therapies  was  4  in Group A, 3 in Group B, and 2 in Group C.

Table 10: Summary of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, study Hx-CD20-402

Rapid, efficient, and sustained depletion of malignant and normal B cells was observed in all subjects in Group C during the study period.  The median time to progression in Group C was 4.4 months in the full analysis population and 5.3 months in the subgroup of responders. The duration of response was 4.4 months, and the time to next CLL therapy was 12.1 months. Based on the results of this study a dose of 2000 mg was chosen for the pivotal study. Higher doses of ofatumumab were not tested in this or  any subsequent clinical  study  nor  were  any  other  phase  I/II studies submitted in support of the choice of dose as well as the frequency and duration of treatment (see also section on supportive studies).  Main study Hx-CD20-406 This is an ongoing, single arm, open-label, multicentre (41 sites in 10 countries) study of ofatumumab in subjects with B-CLL who are either refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab, or who are refractory to fludarabine and were considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab treatment due to bulky lymphadenopathy.  Single agent ofatumumab was administered as 8 weekly infusions followed by 4 monthly infusions over 24 weeks.  The primary endpoint was response rate over a 24 week period. METHODS Study Participants Adult  subjects  were  eligible  for  participation  if  they  had  active  CLL  and  were  refractory  to  prior therapy  defined  as  a  minimum  of  2  cycles  of  fludarabine  and  at  least  12  administrations  of alemtuzumab  (double  refractory,  DR).    Subjects  were  also  eligible  if  they  were  refractory  to  prior therapy defined as a minimum of 2 cycles of fludarabine and were considered inappropriate candidates for alemtuzumab treatment due to the presence of bulky lymphadenopathy, defined as lymph node size of &gt;5 cm (bulky fludarabine refractory, BFR).

Main inclusion criteria were: Tumour cell phenotype consistent with B-CLL (CD5+CD20+CD23+), patients  with  active  B-CLL  and  with  an  indication  for  treatment  defined  as  presenting  one  of  the conditions  defined  by  the  NCIWG  criteria  (evidence  of  progressive  marrow  failure,  massive  or progressive  splenomegaly  or  lymphadenopathy,  progressive  lymphocytosis,  weight  loss/fever/night sweats), refractory to one fludarabine-containing treatment regimen (failure to achieve at least PR or disease  progression  while  on  treatment  or  disease  progression  in  responders  within  6  months  of treatment), failing at least one alemtuzumab-containing treatment regimen defined as either refractory to  one  alemtuzumab-containing  treatment  regimen  (as  above)  or  considered  inappropriate  for treatment with alemtuzumab due to lymphadenopathy with at least one lymph node &gt;5 cm, ECOG Performance Status of 0-2, life expectancy of at least 6 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Main  exclusion  criteria  included  various  concomitant  or  prior  therapies,  other  malignancies  or transformation  of  B-CLL  to  more  aggressive  malignancies,  CNS  involvement  of  B-CLL,  other significant comorbidities, poor performance status or short life expectancy.

The  trial  population  included  3  populations  established  by  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC) review,  which  were  analyzed  separately:  patients  refractory  to  both  fludarabine  treatment  and alemtuzumab treatment (DR group), patients refractory to fludarabine treatment and were considered inappropriate  to  alemtuzumab  treatment  due  to  bulky  lymphadenopathy  (BFR  group),  other,  i.e. patients  who  were  intolerant/ineligible  to  fludarabine  treatment  and/or  intolerant  to  alemtuzumab treatment  and  who  were  not  included  in  either  of  the  2  groups  above.  Patients  who  fulfilled  the definition of both double refractory and bulky fludarabine refractory were assigned to the DR group.

## Treatments

<!-- image -->

The intended treatment consisted of 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab (first dose: 300 mg; second eighth dose: 2000 mg) followed by 4 monthly infusions of ofatumumab (ninth - 12th dose: 2000 mg). The first monthly infusion was administered 5 weeks after the last weekly infusion and the following 3 monthly infusions were administered every 4 weeks. Thus, the first dose was administered at Week 0 (Visit 2) and the last dose was administered at Week 24 (Visit 14). The trial design is shown in Figure 3 below. Figure 3: Ofatumumab treatment schedule, study Hx-CD20-406 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary objective of the pivotal trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who had failed fludarabine and alemtuzumab. Secondary objectives were to determine the safety of ofatumumab, the host immune response to ofatumumab and the pharmacokinetic profile of ofatumumab.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was response rate (RR) measured over a 24 week period from the start of treatment, as determined by the IRC. Clinical assessments were done by investigators, but response evaluations and classification of patients into DR, BFR and Other (the Other group did not  meet  either  the  DR  or  BFR  classification  criteria)  were  done  centrally  by  an  IRC  based  on evaluations  of  CRF  data  on  lymph  nodes  and  organomegaly  (physical  examination),  relevant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

laboratory data, constitutional symptoms, and medical history. In case of a possible CR, a CT scan and a bone marrow examination were to be performed 8 weeks after a patient fulfilled the NCIWG 1996 guidelines requirements of a CR for the first time. CT scans were required only for the documentation of suspected CR, otherwise, CT scans were not required nor done to confirm PR. Subjects not meeting the criteria for CR, PR or PD were considered to have Stable Disease (SD).  Transformation to a more aggressive histology, including Richter's  syndrome  or  prolymphocytic  leukaemia  with  &gt;55% prolymphocytes, was considered progressive disease.

Subjects  were  classified  as  responders  or  non-responders  as  follows:    complete  remission  (CR), nodular partial remission (nPR), and partial remission (PR) were classified as responders, while stable disease  (SD)  and  progressive  disease  (PD)  were  classified  as  non-responders.    Responses  were required to be maintained for at least two months (56 days). The definitions of each response category are shown in Table 11.

The secondary efficacy  endpoints  included:  duration  of  response,  progression-free  survival,  time  to next  CLL  therapy,  overall  survival,  reduction  in  tumour  size,  CD5+CD19+,  CD5+CD20+  in peripheral blood, and expressions of CD19, CD20, CD55, and CD59 on CD45+CD5+ cells,  progress of  constitutional  symptoms  (night  sweats,  weight  loss,  fever  and  extreme  fatigue),  resolution  of lymphadenopathy  and  organomegaly,  improvement  in  ECOG  Performance  Status,  haemoglobin, thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia  and  number  of  blood  transfusions.  Another  secondary  endpoint was evaluation of the prognostic value of fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) parameters, CD38+, VH mutational  status,  Fc  receptor  polymorphisms,  2  microglobulin,  thymidine  kinase,  circulating CD20 and antigen density.  At the time of the interim analysis, these results were not reported.

## Sample size

Based  on  advice  from  clinical  experts,  it  was  estimated  that  the  objective  response  rate  on  best supportive care in these patient populations was 15% and that an objective response rate of 30% on ofatumumab would be a clinically important improvement. Assuming that the response rate was 30%, the probability that the two-sided 99% confidence interval (CI) would exclude a response rate of 15% was 63%, based on data from 66 patients (primary endpoint interim analysis) and 92% based on data from 100 patients (primary endpoint analysis). This applied equally for both the double refractory and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  bulky  fludarabine  refractory  groups.  A  primary  endpoint  interim  analysis  was  instituted  at  the initial estimated cohort of 66 patients, which was the minimum number of patients that would enable a reasonable power to test the null hypothesis.

The  objective  response  rate  with  salvage  chemotherapy  is  20-25%,  and  0%  with  monoclonal antibodies  [Tam,  2007],  thus  observing  a  30%  overall  response  rate  that  excludes  a  15%  overall response rate at the 1% significance level indicates meaningful efficacy in this refractory population.

## Randomisation

No randomisation was performed as this is an open-label trial.

## Blinding (masking)

The pivotal study was a one-arm study with no control arm and blinding was not attempted.

Statistical methods The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients who had been exposed to trial drug irrespective of their compliance to the planned course of treatment. This was the primary analysis population used for evaluation of all endpoints and all 3 population subgroups. The per protocol (PP) analysis population included  patients  who  had  not  deviated  from  the  protocol  in  such  a  manner  that  the  assessment  of efficacy endpoints could be biased. Exclusions from the PP set were also considered on visit level, i.e. a patient could be included in the PP population but the data from a certain visit excluded. Standard statistical analyses for each of the trial endpoints were used. The  patients  still  on  trial  at  week  12  (landmark  time)  were  separated  into  2  response  categories according to whether they responded before that time. An analysis was performed (landmark analysis) for which probability estimates and statistical tests were conditional on the response status of patients at the landmark time. The null hypothesis that 'survival from landmark does not depend on response status at landmark' versus the alternative that 'subsequent survival does depend on land-mark response status' was tested using the two-sided logrank test. At the time that the  primary efficacy endpoint data from the estimated 66 DR subjects were available, this triggered the pre-defined interim analysis of the IRC assessed response rates. The 66 DR subject trigger was based upon sponsor assessment of eligibility information and status. The IRC confirmed eligibility  of  59  subjects  in  the  DR  group  for  this  interim  analysis,  and  ultimately  reallocated  7 subjects from the DR to the BFR group. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed the IRC assessed response rate analysis. In addition, sponsor generated data queries resulted in two reconsensus meetings of the IRC members to verify the final interim analysis response rates. The IRC was only instructed to downgrade responses to non-responses during this process, and non-responders were not re-evaluated. RESULTS Participant flow Only patients with potential of having primary endpoint data at cut-off were evaluated (i.e. patients with planned or completed Visit 2 ). This included 198 screened patients of whom 154 were allocated and exposed to ofatumumab. Patient assignment based on the IRC assessment included 59 exposed DR patients, 79 exposed BFR patients, and 16 exposed CLL patients assigned as Other.

DR =  Double-refractory;  BFR  =  Bulky  Fludarabine-refractory;  PD  =  progressive  disease;  Death,  NOS  =  death  not  otherwise  specified (occurred after new CLL therapy; only date of death was to be recorded). a. Action taken is 'withdrawal' on AE page but 'Progression of study disease' or 'other' is stated as reason for withdrawal on Withdrawal From Treatment page. Here shown as AE withdrawals (fatal or non-fatal within treatment period). b. If withdrawal reason stated on Withdrawal From Treatment page and End-of-study page differ, the treatment withdrawal reason is shown. For this reason one patient is shown as a non-fatal AE withdrawal (pneumonia) even though the patient died 3 months later (sepsis) without having been included in extended follow-up. c.  Due  to  bad  general  condition;  prohibited  therapy;  new  CLL  treatment;  no  response  (n=2);  to  disease  progression  and  anxiety;  to investigator's decision; disease transformation. d. Due to bone marrow transplant; started new treatment; no response; allogeneic bone marrow transplant. e. Seven patients died during extended follow-up due to SAEs with onset during treatment or follow-up phase. f. Due to palliative care only; lost to follow-up. Recruitment The trial was initiated 13-Jun-2006 (first informed consent signed) and is still ongoing. The cut-off date for this protocol specified interim analysis was 19-May-2008. Conduct of the study The trial protocol underwent 5 amendments which primarily resulted in changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the number of subjects planned.

Amendments 2 and 3 defined the subject eligibility definition consistent with the DR and BFR subject populations and the study would no longer enrol subjects who had demonstrated lack of tolerability to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.  As a result, 16 subjects who were intolerant/ineligible to fludarabine or intolerant to alemtuzumab and enrolled prior to Amendment 2 were included in the interim analysis, and are described and analyzed separately as 'Other'.

Subject 406102 was allowed to enroll in the study despite an ECOG performance status of 3, which due to an elbow surgery, and not related to CLL; c. BFR subjects with assessment of 17p = 76; d. Other subjects with assessment of 17p = 15; e. Total subjects with assessment of 17p = 148; f. Total subjects with assessment of no abnormalities = 150 ;g. Bulky lymphadenopathy defined as presence of at least one lymph node &gt;5 cm by CT scan; h. Organomegaly defined as enlarged liver or spleen or both.

Nearly  all  subjects  received  more  than  two  previous  treatment  regimens  for  CLL,  most  frequently alkylating  agents  (94%),  purine  analog  combinations  (81%),  single  agent  cytotoxics  (68%),  and/or monoclonal antibodies (60%).  Some subjects have been treated with investigational agents as well. The  majority  of  subjects  in  all  groups  also  received  prior  treatment  with  rituximab,  either  as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy.

Other therapy includes investigational drugs and investigational or off-label use of approved drugs (i.e., lenalidomide, thalidomide). All DR subjects had both prior fludarabine and alemtuzumab, either consecutively or as combination therapy.    All  BFR  subjects  had  prior  fludarabine  treatment,  either  as  monotherapy  or  as  part  of  a combination therapy regimen. The majority of subjects (57%) had prior treatment with one or more rituximab containing regimen. The most common regimen was FCR, particularly in the DR group.

The FAS population  was  the  analysis  population  used  throughout  the  presentation  of  results.  Seven  patients were  screened  and  allocated  to  treatment,  but  were  not  treated  with  ofatumumab  and  they  were therefore  not  included  in  the  FAS.  Among  these,  4  patients  were  ineligible  according  to  selection criteria at Visit 2 and 1 patient had progression of disease related symptoms prior to the first infusion. These  5  patients  were  considered  as  screening  failures.  Furthermore,  prior  to  any  ofatumumab exposure, one patient withdrew consent and one patient withdrawn due to deep vein thrombosis. The total number of patients analysed is thus 138, with 59 in the DR group and 79 in the BFR group. There were no major protocol deviations requiring exclusion of patients from the FAS or the PP population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

PD, n (%) NE, n (%) Per  protocol,  investigators  were  instructed  to  determine  an  assessment  of  response  at  each  clinical evaluation visit.  However, investigators were not instructed to determine an overall response for each individual subject.   As a result, there was no overall response assessment for each subject determined by the investigator.  An algorithm was applied to the individual investigator assessment of response at each  visit  to  derive  an  overall  response  for  each  subject,  from  which  an  Investigator  Assessment response  rate  was  calculated.  A  summary  of  the  IRC  assessment,  Investigator  assessment  and  the Sponsor assessment of response rate is provided in the following table. Table 17: Summary of Response Rates as Assessed by IRC, Investigator and Sponsor Response Rates IRC Assessment Responders, n (%) 99% CI (%) Investigator Assessment Responders, n (%) 99% CI (%) Sponsor Calculated Assessment Responders, n (%) 99% CI (%) An expert panel of IRC members applied the protocol specified method of response determination to assure an independent, consistent and medically appropriate application of this composite measure of response in CLL.  Differences in the response rate assessment according to the three measures largely reflected differences in clinical assessment of transient changes that an expert would not interpret as evidence of disease progression.  The algorithmic approach by the sponsor did not account for this, and so represented the most stringent test of the response rate.  Nevertheless, the concordance rates between  assessments  by  the  IRC  and  Sponsor  were  80%  for  the  DR  group  and  84%  for  the  BFR group.    Investigators  evaluated  subjects  for  response  at  each  visit  and  may  not  have  referred  to baseline  measurements when determining response.  In contrast, the IRC was provided all relevant data  at  the  same  time,  including  baseline  measurements,  for  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of overall  response.    This  may  explain  the  differences  between  investigator  response  rates  and  IRC response rates.  This sensitivity analysis provided a range of possible response rate interpretations.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

Reduction in Lymph Node SPD. Lymph node size, as measured by physical exam and reported as the sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) was assessed from baseline until Month 24. Within 4 weeks of ofatumumab treatment, median lymph node SPD decreased in the combined group from 36.9 cm 2 to 17.0 cm 2 , from 26.3 cm 2 to 5.0 cm 2 in the DR group, and from 51.0 cm 2 to 23.0 cm 2 in the BFR group.  This corresponds to an overall 60% decrease in median SPD over 4 weeks (DR: 71%, BFR:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

51%).  At Week 8, the overall median decrease in SPD versus baseline was 69% (DR: 76%, BFR: 63%).  Reductions in median lymph node SPD continued during the treatment period.  At Week 24, the reduction in median SPD versus baseline in the combined group was 81% (DR: 78%, BFR 83%).

Reduction  in  Lymphocyte  Count. Lymphocyte  counts  were  assessed  from  baseline  to  Week  24. Within 1 week of initiation of ofatumumab treatment, the combined group median lymphocyte count was decreased from 18.1x10 9 cells/L at baseline to 10.6x10 9 cells/L, with a reduction in the DR group from  14.7x10 9 cells/L  to  8.5x10 9 cells/L,  and  from  28.5x10 9 cells/L  to  11.4x10 9 cells/L  in  the  BFR group.  This corresponds to a 41% combined median reduction (DR: 42%, BFR: 60%).  By Week 4, the combined group median lymphocyte count was 3.1x10 9 cells/L, with a reduction in the DR group to 3.0x10 9 cells/L, and 3.2x10 9 cells/L in the BFR group,  an 83% combined group median reduction compared to baseline (DR: 81%, BFR: 89%).

Malignant B cells in peripheral blood. Malignant B cells are CD45+CD5+CD19+ or CD45+CD5+CD20+ cells. Ofatumumab binds to CD20 and could interfere with the CD45+CD5+CD20+ assay, therefore, the CD45+CD5+CD19+ assay was also used. Immunophenotyping was done at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. Malignant B cells showed changes similar to those of total lymphocytes (data not shown). Duration of response. Duration of response was defined as the time from initial response to disease progression or death, and was defined only for subjects who responded (CR, nPR or PR) during the 24 week  period  from  start  of  treatment.    A  sensitivity  analysis  of  duration  of  response  was  also performed, which defined the duration of response as the time from initial response until progression reported by local investigator, or AE, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason including disease progression, new CLL treatment, treatment toxicity and death.  The median time to onset of response, median  duration  of  response,  median  duration  of  response  sensitivity  analysis,  and  the  median duration of response after last infusion are shown in the following table.

The median duration of response was 7.1 months in the DR group, and 5.6 months in the BFR and combined groups), indicating that the median duration of response was nearly as long as the intended treatment duration with ofatumumab (24 weeks or 6 months). Progression-free  survival. Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  baseline (allocation to treatment) until progression of CLL or death.  The progression events were defined in the protocol, and progression dates were verified by the IRC.  PFS is presented in the table below for the 102 subjects (DR: 40, BFR: 62) with an observed progression of CLL or death. Table 19: Summary of Progression-Free Survival, Study Hx-CD20-406 Time  to  next  CLL  treatment. Time  to  next  CLL  treatment  was  defined  as  the  time  from  baseline (allocation  of  treatment)  to  the  time  of  first  administration  of  the  next  CLL  treatment  other  than ofatumumab.  A total of 31 DR (53%) and 51 BFR subjects (65%) with disease progression during the study period received subsequent CLL therapy, see table below: Table 20: Summary of Time to Next CLL Treatment Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of the 154 patients, 88 patients (57%) had new subsequent CLL treatment following treatment with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ofatumumab  in  this  trial.  A  total  of  46  different  treatment  combinations  were  used  as  new  CLL therapy that included chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemo-immunotherapy, radiotherapy, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and leukapheresis.

Overall Survival. At the time of the interim analysis, 27 DR and 31 BFR subjects (58 combined group) had died.  The median overall survival was similar across groups.

Table 21: Summary of Overall Survival

13.7 95% CI: 9.4, na Constitutional symptoms. Constitutional symptoms were reported by subjects and results captured by investigators every 4 weeks during the treatment period (Week 0 to Week 24) and through the followup  period  (Week  28  to  Month  24)  as  part  of  assessment  of  response.  More  than  three-quarters  of subjects  with  baseline  constitutional  symptoms  experienced  complete  resolution  of  all  symptoms  at some  point  during  the  study  (79%,  61/77).    All  but  one  of  these  subjects  experienced  complete resolution during the treatment period.  Nearly all responders with baseline constitutional symptoms experienced  complete  resolution  (93%,  40/43).    In  addition,  all  subjects  without  constitutional symptoms at baseline remained symptom-free during the study. Resolution  of  lymphadenopathy. Complete  resolution  of  lymphadenopathy  was  defined  as  the presence of palpable lymph nodes  1 cm at baseline followed by palpable lymph nodes of normal size (&lt;1 cm) at a later time. One-fifth of the combined group subjects with baseline lymphadenopathy had complete resolution at some point during the study (20%, 25/128); the majority had some persistent lymphadenopathy during study treatment. There were no subjects without baseline lymphadenopathy that developed new lymphadenopathy during the study. Resolution of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Complete resolution was defined as the presence of an enlarged palpable spleen or liver at baseline followed by absence of splenomegaly post-baseline. More than half of subjects in the combined group experienced complete resolution of splenomegaly some time  during  the  study  (60%,  42/70),  and  all  occurred  during  the  treatment  period.    Of  these,  34 subjects experienced complete resolution of splenomegaly during response.  More than two-thirds of subjects in the combined group experienced complete resolution of hepatomegaly some time during the  study  (71%,  24/34),  and  all  occurred  during  the  treatment  period.    Of  these,  17  subjects experienced complete resolution of hepatomegaly during response.  The absence of organomegaly was maintained in the majority of subjects without baseline organomegaly, two subjects had worsening of splenomegaly  and  one  subject  had  worsening  of  hepatomegaly  as  best  response  during  the  study period.

Improvement in ECOG performance status. Nearly half of subjects with the opportunity to improve in ECOG performance status from baseline did improve (48%, 41/86), with the improvement occurring during the treatment period in 39 of 41 subjects.  Most improvements in responders occurred during the  time  of  response  to  ofatumumab  (64%,  27/42).    More  than  one-third  of  subjects  with  the opportunity  to  improve  maintained  their  ECOG  performance  status  (41%,  35/86),  and  very  few subjects  declined  (5%,  4/86).    Nearly  all  subjects  with  an  ECOG  performance  status  of  0  did  not worsen during the study period (96%, 50/52).

Improvement in haemoglobin values. Haemoglobin values increased steadily from baseline through the treatment period and into the follow-up period, as shown in the following Figure 6.

Improvement in platelet counts. Almost half of subjects with low platelets at baseline had documented improvement  in  platelet  levels  at  some  time  during  the  study  (46%,  46/100),  with  most  of  the improvements occurring during the treatment period.  Nearly all of the subjects with normal or high platelet levels at baseline maintained their levels during the study (97%, 36/37).  Only one subject had a worsening of a normal platelet level during the study. Improvement  in  neutropenia. Median  neutrophil  counts  remained  above  the  lower  limit  of  normal from baseline through the treatment period and into the follow-up period, as shown in the following Figure 7.

## Ancillary analyses

The Applicant submitted a number of ancillary analyses which indicated that the effect of ofatumumab was independent of prior cyclophosphamide, rituximab and FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab)  treatment  and  independent  of  the  number  of  prior  CLL  therapies  employed  (data  not shown).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No analyses across trials were submitted.

-  Clinical studies in special populations

Analyses  in  special  populations  of  the  pivotal  study  Hx-CD20-406  indicated  that  there  was  no difference in response to ofatumumab due to age, sex and geopraphic region. As very few patients were  non-Caucasian,  no  race  differences  could  not  be  assessed.  Baseline  disease  characteristics, including bone marrow involvement and number and size of enlarged lymph nodes were not found to affect  the  response  to  ofatumumab.  With  regard  to  chromosomal  abnormalities,  17q  deletion,  11q deletion  and  12q  trisomy  were  not  found  to  affect  the  response  to  ofatumumab,  as  opposed  to  13q deletion, which seemed to favour the response.

Over-expression  of  CD38+  is  an  adverse  prognostic  marker  for  CLL.    Subjects  were  assessed  at baseline for CD38 expression levels.  Subjects were considered CD38+ if the percentage of CD38+ among  CD5+CD19+  cells  was  greater  than  20%  as  compared  to  isotope  controls.    CD38+  status appeared to be predictive of response in DR subjects, but not in BFR subjects.  DR subjects who were CD38+ had a response rate of 41%, versus 80% in subjects who were CD38- (p=0.0036). Subjects were assessed at baseline for Fc receptor polymorphisms, and were classified by one of three phenotypes of Fc  IIa (H/A, A/A, H/H), and by one of three phenotypes of Fc  IIIa (V/P, P/P, V/V). The response rates were similar for all phenotypes within both the DR and BFR groups, suggesting that Fc receptor polymorphisms are not predictive of response to ofatumumab.  Supportive study The only study in CLL apart from the pivotal Hx-CD20-406 study was the dose-finding Hx-CD20-402 study. A juxtaposition to the pivotal study Hx-CD20-402 is presented in the following table. Table 22: Comparison of Study Hx-CD20-406 and Study Hx-CD20-402 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although ofatumumab showed activity in CLL, the lack of control group made it impossible to conclusively assess the efficacy of ofatumumab relative to other treatments in subjects with double refractory or fludarabine refractory-bulky lymphadnopathy CLL. The Applicant's view that it was not feasible to conduct a comparative study was questioned and the use of a historical comparison was not considered adequate. Similarly, the comparison of time-dependent endpoints in responding patients vs non-responders (landmark analysis) was questioned, as response could simply be a marker for patients with pretreatment characteristics that favour longer survival. Although no single therapy stands out as the treatment of choice for refractory patients, a comparison against 'physician's choice' or standard of care was felt to have been an option. Mono- or combination therapies of alkylators, antimetabolites or monoclonal antibodies were proposed as potential comparators. An  Oncology  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG-O)  was  convened  to  provide  their  clinical  expert opinion on these issues. The SAG was asked to discuss potential acceptable active comparators for a confirmatory phase III trial in a comparable population to the one included in the pivotal phase II trial (patients  refractory  to  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab  or  refractory  to  fludarabine  and  ineligible  for alemtuzumab  due  to  bulky  lymphadenopathy)  also  taking  into  account  that  80%  were  deemed refractory to alkylating  agents and  that a substantial  number  of  patients  had  progressed  on chemotherapy with rituximab as add-on. They were also asked whether a comparison to physician's choice would be feasible. The SAG argued that it is important to distinguish two separate groups of patients, namely patients whose disease is refractory to at least two regimen including fludarabine and alemtuzumab  ('double-refractory'),  versus  patients  whose  disease  is  refractory  to  fludarabine  and ineligible for alemtuzumab due to bulky lymphadenopathy ('bulky fludarabine refractory'). These two groups  differ  significantly  in  terms  of  disease  biology,  number  of  therapies  received,  available treatment options. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For double-refractory disease, the SAG agreed that it was unfortunate that no comparative data were available, for example, to assess the effect of ofatumumab on overall survival, but also acknowledged that  choice  of  comparator  was  very  problematic.  In  this  group,  particular  after  disease  progression after  multiple  regimens  chemotherapy  and  monoclonal  antibodies,  performance  status  is  often  poor and  there  are  no  regimens  with  established  efficacy  and  safety,  according  to  scientific  standards. Although in practice salvage chemotherapy is attempted when possible, such regimens are associated with significant toxicity including mortality. Therefore, their use as active controls could bias efficacy comparisons in favour of the less toxic treatments, regardless of efficacy. Thus, the SAG agreed that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

although theoretically possible, the choice of an active and safe control in double-refractory disease was very difficult due to the lack of an established regimen. However, one SAG member disagreed arguing  that  even  in  this  population  it  is  feasible  to  conduct  randomized  controlled  trials  against physician  best  choice,  and  that  in  the  absence  of  randomized  trials  the  relative  effects  in  terms  of efficacy and safety cannot be established.

The SAG agreed that the situation is different in 'bulky fludarabine-refractory' disease, where patients are  less  pre-treated  and  in  a  better  condition  to  tolerate  salvage  therapies.  In  this  second-line indication,  acceptable  comparators  including  salvage  chemotherapy  or  chemotherapy  and  rituximab should  be  considered,  although  their  activity  is  considered  lower  than  for  fludarabine-refractory patients.  Indeed  a  number  of  patients  had  received  such  2nd  line  regimen  including  rituximab.  The SAG agreed that patients with 'bulky fludarabine-refractory' disease that is refractory to at least two regimens (at least one of which included fludarabine), are considered to be in a similar situation as that of patients with 'double-refractory' disease.

The  SAG  was  also  asked  to  discuss  the  acceptability  and  feasibility  of  a  phase  II  trial  with  best supportive  care  as  comparator.  The  SAG  agreed  that  if  the  performance  status  allows  it,  best supportive  care  would  not  be  an  acceptable  comparator  due  to  the  significant  symptoms  and  rapid worsening of the disease. In patients when the performance status is poor and supportive care is the only available option, phase III trials would be difficult to conduct, due to the very poor prognosis and the limited chances for new treatments to change the course of the disease. As an answer to the question whether an unmet medical need existed for the population in question, the SAG agreed that for patients with double-refractory disease there is clearly an unmet medical need. Available regimens have not been established according to scientific standards and are associated with significant toxicity including toxic deaths. The situation is different in 'bulky fludarabine-refractory' disease,  where  patients  are  less  pre-treated  and  in  a  better  condition  to  tolerate  salvage  therapies; however following  second  line  therapy  no  therapeutic  option  is  available.  Thus  the  unmet  medical need for patients with 'bulky fludarabine-refractory' disease that is refractory to at least two regimens (at  least  one  of  which  included  fludarabine),  is  similar  to  that  of  patients  with  'double-refractory' disease. Finally, in response to the question whether the apparently high response rate observed in the pivotal trial is clinically relevant, the SAG agreed to the following: The population of patients whose disease is  refractory  to  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab  was  adequately  represented  in  the  pivotal  Study  HxCD20-406. In this subgroup, the median number of prior therapies was 5, 93% of patients received prior alkylating agents and 59% received prior rituximab. The SAG agreed that the ORR observed in this population was high, the onset of the response was rapid and the duration of response was longlasting. The SAG agreed that it is reasonable to assume that this effect will lead to some improvement in  disease  related  symptoms  and  that  this  is  expected  to  be  of  clinical  relevance.  The  clinical improvements may in principle allow further clinically relevant benefits, e.g., allowing further salvage treatments (or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) in general not doable in such patients. Indeed,  in  the  pivotal  trial  responses  were  associated  with  clinical  improvement  in  disease-related symptoms and this would be of immediate clinical relevance to the patients. However, this is based on exploratory analyses of a single-arm trial and firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The SAG agreed that further studies should address the basis for stopping treatment after 24 weeks, because treatment discontinuation was associated with loss of response.

The SAG agreed that drug refractoriness should be clearly defined in the prescribing information, in line with the definition used in the pivotal study, namely, failure to achieve at least a partial response with fludarabine or alemtuzumab treatment, or disease progression within 6 months of the last dose of fludarabine or alemtuzumab.

The SAG agreed that similar  considerations  applied  to  patients  with  'bulky  fludarabine-refractory' disease that is refractory to at least two regimens (at least one of which included fludarabine). These

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients were included in the study and similar response rates and durations were observed as for the double-refractory subgroup.

## Clinical safety

The safety  database  included  subjects  who  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  ofatumumab.  The studies  contributing  to  the  safety  analysis  are  reported  in  Table  23.  Because  patients  in  other indications  received  significantly  lower  doses  of  ofatumumab  in  the  course  of  their  treatment,  as detailed in Table 23, only CLL patients are considered in the following.

13. Study Hx-CD20-408 - Study terminated. 14. One subject (402614) was allocated to 2000 mg dose group, but only received one infusion of 500 mg (priming dose). The  safety  of  Arzerra  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refactory  CLL  was  evaluated  in  two  open  label studies.    In  study  Hx-CD20-406,  154  patients  were  enrolled  to  receive  an  initial  dose  of  300 mg followed by 7 consecutive weekly infusions of 2000 mg, followed five weeks later with 4 consecutive monthly  infusions  of  2000 mg.    The  second  study  (Hx-CD20-402)  was  a  dose-finding  study  and patients in three cohorts (3 patients, 3 patients, 27 patients) received a starting dose of 100 mg, 300 mg or  500 mg,  followed  a  week  later  with  3  consecutive  weekly  infusions  of  500 mg,  1000 mg  or 2000 mg of Arzerra, respectively.  The adverse reactions reported are from final data from the initial dose-range finding and a planned interim analysis of study Hx-CD20-406. Most subjects in study 406 (90%, 139 subjects) received all 8 weekly infusions, 69% (107 subjects) received at least 10 infusions and 55% (85 subjects) received all 12 infusions (completed 24 weeks of treatment). In the supportive study 402, most subjects in the 2000 mg group received the intended 4 infusions (25/27).  Adverse events An overview of adverse events in the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 as of the cut-off date for the interim analysis (19 May 2008) is given in Table 24. Table 24: Overview of AEs in Subjects in Study Hx-CD20-406 (Treatment or Follow-up) Number of subjects, n (%) Any AE Drug-related AEs AEs  Grade 3 Infusion Reaction AEs Infections All AEs leading to withdrawal from treatment All SAEs Fatal (Grade 5) SAEs 1. 5 additional subjects had disease progression listed as the AE that resulted in discontinuation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition to infections and infusion reactions, common adverse events (experienced by ≥ 10%) were: Pyrexia (31 subjects, 20%), cough (30 subjects, 19%), diarrhoea (28 subjects, 18%), pneumonia (25 subjects,  16%),  neutropenia  (25  subjects,  16%),  anaemia  (25  subjects,  16%),  fatigue  (23  subjects, 15%) and dyspnoea (22 subjects, 14%). Most of the adverse events were seen in subjects on treatment (81%). Infusion reactions occurred with the greatest incidence (44%) on the first infusion day (300 mg or  500  mg),  decreased  to  26%  with  the  second  infusion  (2000 mg)  and  declined  further  during subsequent infusions (2000 mg).

In  the  supportive  study  Hx-CD20-402,  27  (82%)  patients  reported  246  AEs  which  predominantly (92%) were of CTC grade 1-2 intensity. A total of 23 of 33 (70%) subjects had infusion related events (i.e. events with onset on an infusion day). Of the 138 infusion related events 84 (61%) were reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on the day of the first infusion. Sixteen of the 33 (48%) subjects had infections. The most common infections  were  of  the  respiratory  tract  (10  subjects,  30%).  Eleven  of  the  33  subjects  (33%)  had  Grade 3  AEs.  Thrombocytopenia  (3  subjects,  9%),  neutropenia  (2  subjects,  6%),  and  pyrexia  (2 subjects, 6%) were the most common  Grade 3 AEs.

Adverse events considered  related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator  (adverse  drug  reactions)  in  both CLL studies (402 and 406) are shown in Table 25. A total of 21% of subjects in the study had an adverse  event  in  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  that  was  considered  related  to  treatment. Symptoms that characterize infusion reactions were considered drug-related in 47% of the subjects.

Adverse drug reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Very common ( ≥ 1/10); Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); Very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Infections

Infections reported in the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 were of Grade 1 or 2 in severity in 91 of 154 patients (59%).

A total of 31 (20%) subjects had 39 Grade 3 infections (in 27 subjects, these events were also reported as  SAEs).  In  8  subjects  with  Grade  3  infections,  the  events  were  considered  drug-related  by  the investigator (pneumonias: 4 subjects; septic complication: 1 subject, other infections: 3 subjects). Six of these infections were also reported as SAEs.

Eight  of  154  subjects  (5%)  had  Grade  4  infections,  all  of  which  were  also  reported  as  SAEs.  The majority of these infections (6 events in 6 subjects) were respiratory tract infections, with pneumonias

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

being the most common events (4 subjects, 4 events). Grade 4 infections in 6 subjects were considered drug-related (pneumonias: 3 subjects; septic complication: 1 subject, other infections: 2 subjects). Grade 5 (fatal)  infections  occurred  in  16  subjects  (10%)  during  treatment  or  follow-up;  9  occurred within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  of  ofatumumab,  5  occurred  within  30  to  60  days  after  last  dose  of ofatumumab,  and  2  occurred  beyond  60  days  after  the  last  dose  of  ofatumumab.  During  extended follow-up, an additional 14 subjects (9%) died due to infection (6 pneumonia, 7 sepsis, 1 aspergillus infection). Two of these 14 deaths occurred in close proximity (i.e., within 30 days) to last dose, one being categorized as an early death (defined as occurring within 8 weeks of starting treatment). Both deaths occurred after the start of new CLL therapy (one patient started on high dose steroids and died 38 days after the last dose, and the other started on high dose steroids and lenalidomide and died 32 days after the last dose.

A total of 40 (26% of 154) subjects had infections that required hospitalization and IV antibiotics.

A total  of  24  of  154  subjects  (16%)  had  27  infections  that  were  considered  opportunistic  based  on clinical  practice.  All  but  one  serious  opportunistic  infection  occurred  in  non-responders.  The opportunistic  infections  that  were  serious  included  herpes  zoster,  aspergilloma,  fusarium  infection, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, fungal pneumonia and PML. Factors  associated  with  higher  frequency  and/or  increased  severity  of  infection  included  advanced stage of the disease, high number of prior treatments and baseline neutropenia (especially severe). In the dose escalation supportive study Hx-CD20-402, 16 subjects (48%) had infections reported as AEs. Respiratory tract infections were the most common events, occurring in 10 of 33 subjects (30%). In  contrast  to  the  pivotal  study,  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract  were  more  common  (9 subjects,  27%)  than  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (1  subject,  3%).  The  most  common  upper respiratory infection was nasopharyngitis occurring in 5 subjects (15%). Other infections occurred in 7 subjects (21%). There were no cases of sepsis reported. A total of 3 subjects had 4 infections that were considered to be related to study treatment: one subject had  herpes  zoster  and  pustular  rash,  one  subject  had  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  one  had varicella.  Three  subjects  reported  infectious  SAEs:  Grade 3  herpes  zoster,  Grade 3  pneumonia,  and Grade 2  event  of  sinusitis.  Three  subjects  had  Grade 5  (i.e.,  fatal)  infections.  One  subject  had  ILD during the main study period and 2 subjects had pneumonia after completion of the study. Infusion reactions In the pivotal study, 41% of subjects had infusion reaction AEs following the first infusion declining to 6% for the last infusion. One subject stopped treatment due to an infusion reaction. The events were usually  mild  (  Grade 2).  Seven  subjects  had  infusion  reactions  classified  as  SAEs.  There  were  no deaths  due  to  infusion  reactions.  Anaphylactoid  events  included  5  patients  with  cytokine  release syndrome, all but one subject had cytokine release syndrome during their first infusion.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Pivotal Study HX-CD20-406 A summary of SAEs experienced by more than one subject during treatment or follow-up in study Hx-CD20-406 is shown in Table 26.

For the combination therapy study Hx-CD20-407, 12 subjects (43%) had 23 SAEs. The most common SAEs were neutropenia (5) and febrile neutropenia (3). Four of the subjects had drug-related SAEs: rhabdomyolysis, neutropenia, fungal pneumonia and decreased neutrophil count.

Predominant SAEs reported during extended follow-up, i.e., after treatment withdrawal or withdrawal from follow-up, were infections (6 DR, 7 BFR, and 2 Other subjects) and disease progression/CLL (4 DR, 6 BFR, 0 Other subjects). A total of 25 (16%) subjects had 39 SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to ofatumumab (11 subjects in the DR group, 8 in the BFR group, 6 in the Other group). Supportive CLL Study (Hx-CD20-402) and CLL Combination Study (Hx-CD20-407) Nine of 33 subjects (27%) had 10 SAEs during study Hx-CD20-402; the majority were in the 2000 mg group: neutropenia (2), haemolytic anaemia, carotid artery stenosis, angina pectoris, ILD, pneumonia, herpes zoster, sinusitis and cytolytic hepatitis. Five SAEs were considered drug-related: herpes zoster, 2 events of neutropenia, ILD and cytolytic hepatitis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  supportive  CLL  study  Hx-CD20-402,  there  were  3  deaths,  one  during  treatment  and  2  after withdrawal from the study. One subject died of ILD 29 days after the last dose of ofatumumab; this fatal  SAE  was  considered  drug-related.  This  subject  had  a  10-year  history  of  CLL,  had  4  prior treatments for CLL, prior treatment for chronic hypogammaglobulinemia, and had several episodes of pneumonia (interstitial  pneumopathy)  prior  to  entry  into  the  study.  The  investigator  considered  the event  to  be  drug-related.  Two  subjects  died  after  withdrawal  from  the  study  (pneumonia,  disease progression). These events were not considered related to treatment.

GEN410 / RA 54 0 GEN411 / RA 12 0 GEN413 / RA 10 0 Hx-CD20-408 / COPD 5 0 A total of 61 subjects (clinical cut-off 19 May 2008) died during the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406); 24 during treatment or follow-up and 37 during the extended follow-up (7 before and 30 after initiation of new  CLL  treatment).  Most  subjects  died  &gt;60  days  after  the  last  dose  of  ofatumumab  (Table  16) including 2 subjects who died &gt;1 year after last dose of ofatumumab. In addition, four deaths (disease progression, pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrest and bladder cancer) occurred after the clinical cut-off date. Seven deaths occurred during the extended follow-up, with no specific diagnosis given as cause of  death.  Six  subjects  died  within  8  weeks  after  the  start  of  treatment  (i.e.,  early  death):  1  due  to pneumonia (after initiation of new CLL therapy), 2 due to sepsis, 1 each due to fungal pneumonia, fusarium infection and myocardial infarction. None of these early deaths were considered related to treatment by the investigator. Table 28: Summary of Deaths, Analyzed by Days after Last Infusion in Study Hx-CD20-406 Days From Last Infusion DR (N=59) BFR (N=79) Number of deaths n=27 n=31 Early deaths 1 , n (%) 4 (7) 2 (3) 1 - 30 days, n (%) 4 (7) 3 (4) &gt;30 - 60 days, n (%) 5 (8) 1 (1) &gt;60 days, n (%) 14 (24) 25 (32) 1. Early death defined as occurring within 8 weeks of start of treatment. Sixteen of the 24 deaths during treatment and follow-up were due to infections: 10 (17%) of 59 DR subjects, 5 (6%) of 79 BFR subjects and 1 (6%) of 16 Other subjects. The most common infections were septic complications (15 subjects) and pneumonia (10 subjects). Of all deaths in this study four cases were  considered  related  to treatment  by  the investigator: sepsis,  pneumocystis  jiroveci pneumonia, pneumonia, PML. The remaining eight deaths were caused by disease progression, including CLL transformation and hemiparesis in 6 subjects and cardiac events in 2 subjects during treatment or follow-up.

There  have  been  no  deaths  in  the  CLL  combination  study  (Hx-CD20-407)  or  the  FL  combination study (Hx-CD20-409) as of the cut-off date of 14 April 2008. Seven deaths were reported in the FL monotherapy  studies  (Hx-CD20-001,  Hx-CD20-405),  none  of  which  were  considered  related  to treatment. Three deaths occurred on study and were caused by disease progression (2 cases, 63 days

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 6 months after last dose) and sepsis (37 days after last dose). Four cases occurred after withdrawal from study and were caused by sepsis, disease progression (2) and peritonitis.

## Immunogenicity

Subjects  were  tested  for  Human  anti-Human  Antibodies  (HAHA)  at  baseline,  and  at  the  indicated times over the course of the individual studies.  A positive result was defined as an 8-fold increase over the baseline titre of HAHA.

There were no reports for the development of HAHA in any of the CLL studies. Of the 3 studies in Folicular  Lymphoma (FL), one patient in one study was scored HAHA positive (8-fold increase in titre)  in  a  single  instance.  In  the  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  (RA)  study, one  patient  had  a positive  result (16-fold increase in titre) at a single instance, which was not confirmed using the whole ofatumumab binding antibody clinical assay.

 Laboratory findings Haematologic Assessments A decrease in the median neutrophil count within the first few weeks of ofatumumab treatment was evident.  The neutrophil count in subjects with baseline neutropenia did not appear to worsen during the treatment period.  Neutropenia, including Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, was observed in subjects with baseline neutropenia as well as in some subjects with a normal neutrophil count at baseline. Decrease in  the  neutrophil  count  (including  AEs  with  the  preferred  terms  neutropenia,  neutropenic  sepsis, neutrophil  count  decreased,  and  febrile  neutropenia)  has  been  associated  with  anti-CD20  antibody therapy and it was reported in the pivotal study in 19% of subjects in at least one instance. Anaemia  was  observed  as  an  AE  in  19%  of  subjects  although  many  had  anaemia  at  baseline. However, no decrease in median hemoglobin values and no clinically meaningful shifts to worse CTC grades were observed in the study population.  On the contrary, there was evidence for an increase in median haemoglobin values during the 52 week observation period. Thrombocytopenia  was  observed  as  an  AE  in  2  (1%)  subjects  and  both  were  thrombocytopenic  at baseline.  However, no decrease in median platelet count and no clinically meaningful shifts to worse CTC  grades  were  observed  in  the  study  population.    On  the  contrary,  there  was  evidence  for  an increase in median platelet counts during the 52 week observation period. Biochemistry Assessments Forty percent (40%) of patients had elevated values for uric acid of at least Grade 3 intensity, which is not  unexpected  due  to  the  rapid  cell  destruction  induced  by  ofatumumab.    Three  patients  had hyperuricemia  reported  as  an  AE  of  which  one  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to ofatumumab.  Despite these results, no AEs of tumour lysis syndrome were reported as of the cut-off date (19 May 2008). Of the 6 patients who had AEs associated with potassium levels, none of these AEs were considered related  to  ofatumumab  by  the  investigator.  For  the  5  patients  that  had  laboratory  transitions  from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 on study, all normalized and none of these patients had concomitant AEs related to cardiac dysfunction. A total of 3 patients had decreased laboratory values for sodium.  Each of these patients had a single Grade 3 sodium value.  One of these 3 abnormal sodium values was reported by the investigator as an AE considered by the investigator to be related to ofatumumab.  The same patient also had arrhythmia reported on study day 86 during the dosing period, 5 days prior to laboratory assessment that revealed decreased sodium. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Three  patients  had  creatinine  abnormalities  that  were  reported  as  adverse  events.    None  of  these abnormalities were &gt;Grade 2 and patients recovered from each event.

Grade 3 hepatobiliary abnormalities were observed in 1% of the 154 subjects.  There were no Grade 4 hepatobiliary  abnormalities  reported.    No  subject  had  concurrent  elevation  of  GPT  (ALT)  and  total bilirubin.

-  Safety in special populations

Adverse events were analysed in the pivotal study by age. The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects  65 years of age compared with the younger subject population. Overall, the incidence of AEs was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

92% in subjects &lt;65 years of age, 98%   in subjects ≥ 65 years of age, and 94% in subjects ≥ 75 years of age.  There  were  few  notable  differences  in  the  AE  profile  based  upon  age,  though  interpretation  is limited by the small number of subjects in the oldest age group and the small number of subjects with AEs in each age (data not shown).

Among all subjects in the pivotal study, the overall incidence of AEs was similar in male subjects and female subjects. Male subjects had higher rates of respiratory tract infections and fatigue while female subjects had higher rates of anaemia (data not shown).

The majority (94-97%) of subjects in all studies were Caucasian. Therefore, no meaningful clinical conclusions can be drawn from analyses of AEs by race.

No specific studies of the effect of renal or hepatic impairment have been submitted with ofatumumab, nor has it been administered to subjects with significant hepatic or renal impairment.

No studies  addressing  the  effect  of  ofatumumab  on  male  and  female  fertility  and  on  pregnant  and lactating women were submitted. No information on the use of ofatumumab in children or adolescents was submitted.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical safety).  Discontinuation due to adverse events In  the  pivotal  Study Hx-CD20-406, 27 (17%) of 154 subjects had AEs that led to withdrawal from treatment  (21  subjects)  or  follow-up  (6  subjects)  as  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  19 May 2008.  14 subjects discontinued due to fatal infections (8 DR subjects, 5 BFR subjects, 1 Other subject).  The most common AEs that resulted in withdrawal were pneumonia (6 subjects: 4 DR, 2 BFR) and sepsis (6 subjects: 4 DR, 2 BFR). The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to withdrawal (excluding 5 subjects who discontinued due to disease progression but were listed as AEs) was higher in the DR group than in the BFR group (DR: 11/59 [19%]; BFR: 8/79 [10%], respectively).  In the Other group, 3/16 subjects (19%) had an AE that led to withdrawal. The majority of subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation that were considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug (23/27, 85%).  Four subjects had AEs that were considered to be related to  study  medication;  2  in  the  DR  group  (pneumonia  and  hypersensitivity),  1  in  the  BFR  group (pneumonia) and 1 in the Other group (neutropenia). Nineteen subjects had 20 SAEs resulting in withdrawal from treatment or follow-up and 11 subjects were withdrawn due to SAEs with fatal outcome.  Post marketing experience Not applicable.  Discussion on clinical safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CHMP considered that the safety profile of ofatumumab could not be sufficiently characterised due  to  the  uncontrolled  design  of  the  pivotal  trial.  Particular  concern  was  raised  with  regard  to infections and deaths, the latter resulting primarily from infections. The SAG Oncology was consulted as to whether the safety profile was sufficiently evaluated. The SAG considered that this toxicity is not unacceptable compared to other salvage regimens that are commonly used in this setting, based on the literature.  For  instance,  Tam  et  al  reporting  on  58  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab  refractory  CLL patients  treated  at  a  single  institution  found  that  early  deaths  (defined  as  death  within  8  weeks  of starting therapy) occurred in 16% of patients and 60% of patients suffered major infections. The phase II study reported by Perkins et al (2002), although on 27 patients, reports 89% severe infections and 48% fatal infections. The SAG agreed by consensus that for patients with double-refractory disease, the toxicity profile has been sufficiently evaluated and is considered acceptable.

Ofatumumab was associated with infusion reactions leading to temporary interruption of treatment or withdrawal  of  treatment.    Pre-medications  attenuate  infusion  reactions  but  these  may  still  occur, predominantly during the first infusion. Infusion reactions may include anaphylactoid events, cardiac events,  chills/rigors,  cough,  cytokine  release  syndrome,  diarrhoea,  dyspnoea,  fatigue,  flushing, hypertension,  hypotension,  nausea,  pain,  pyrexia,  rash,  and  urticaria.    Even  with  pre-medication, severe  reactions,  including  cytokine  release  syndrome,  were  reported.    In  cases  of  severe  infusion reaction, the infusion must be interrupted immediately and symptomatic treatment instituted.

Infusion  reactions  occur  more  frequently  on  the  first  day  of  infusion  and  tend  to  decrease  with subsequent infusions.  Patients with a history of decreased pulmonary function may be at a greater risk for pulmonary complications from severe reactions and should be monitored closely during infusion (see SPC section 4.2 and 4.4).

Arzerra should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer therapy and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see SPC section 4.2). Patients should be premedicated prior to Arzerra infusion according to the dosing schedule described in the SPC (see SPC section 4.2). Arzerra is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or to any of the excipients (see SPC section 4.3). In patients with CLL, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur with use of ofatumumab.  Management of TLS includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function, maintenance of fluid balance and supportive care (see SPC section 4.4). Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  and  death  has  been  reported  in  CLL  patients receiving  cytotoxic  pharmacotherapy,  including  ofatumumab.    A  diagnosis  of  PML  should  be considered in any patient who reports the new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurologic signs and symptoms.  If a diagnosis of PML is suspected ofatumumab should be discontinued and referral to a neurologist should be considered (see SPC section 4.4). The safety  of,  and  ability  to  generate  a  primary  or  anamnestic  response  to,  immunisation  with  live attenuated or inactivated vaccines during ofatumumab treatment has not been studied.  The response to vaccination could be impaired when B cells are depleted.  Due to the risk of infection, administration of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and after treatment with ofatumumab, until B cell counts  are  normalized.    The  risks  and  benefits  of  vaccinating  patients  during  ofatumumab  therapy should be considered (SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). Hepatitis B  infection  (HBV),  including  fatal  infection,  can  occur  in  patients  taking  ofatumumab. Hepatitis B  reactivation  including  fulminant  hepatitis  and  death  occurs  with  other  monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20.  Patients at high risk of HBV infection should be screened before initiation of treatment.  Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection during treatment with and for 6-12 months following the last infusion. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop viral hepatitis, and appropriate treatment should be instituted.  Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of administration of ofatumumab in patients with active hepatitis (see SPC section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients  with  a  history  of  cardiac  disease  should  be  monitored  closely.    Ofatumumab  should  be discontinued  in  patients  who  experience  serious  or  life-threatening  cardiac  arrhythmias    (see  SPC section 4.4).

Bowel  obstruction  was  reported  in  patients  receiving  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  therapy, including ofatumumab.  Patients who present with abdominal pain, especially early in the course of therapy, should be evaluated and appropriate treatment instituted (see SPC section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since ofatumumab binds to all CD-20-positive lymphocytes (malignant and non-malignant), complete blood  counts  and  platelet  counts  should  be  obtained  at  regular  intervals  during  therapy  and  more frequently in patients who develop cytopenias (see SPC section 4.4).

Arzerra  contains  64.5 mg  sodium  per  300 mg  dose  and  430 mg  sodium  per  2000 mg  dose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet (see SPC section 4.4).

There are no data from the use of ofatumumab in pregnant women. The effect on human pregnancy is unknown.  Besides an expected pharmacological effect, i.e., depletion of B-cells, animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maternal toxicity, pregnancy or embryonal/foetal  development  (see  section  5.3).    Pre-  and  postnatal  development  studies  have  not been  performed  with  ofatumumab.    Ofatumumab  should  not  be  administered  to  pregnant  women unless  the  possible  benefit  to  the  mother  outweighs  the  possible  risk  to  the  foetus. Women  of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after the last ofatumumab treatment (see SPC section 4.6).

The safe use of ofatumumab in humans during lactation has not been established. The excretion of ofatumumab in milk has not been studied in animals.  It is not known whether ofatumumab is secreted in human milk; however, human IgG is secreted in human milk.  Published data suggest that neonatal and infant consumption of breast milk does not result in substantial absorption of these maternal antibodies into circulation.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of treatment with Arzerra unless the possible benefit outweighs the possible risk (see SPC section 4.6). There are no data on the effects of ofatumumab on human fertility.  Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies (see SPC section 4.6). No studies on the effects of Arzerra on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. No detrimental effect on such activities are predicted from the pharmacology of Arzerra.  The clinical status of the subject and the ADR profile of Arzerra should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills (see SPC section 4.7). 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

'There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as Arzerra; however the formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies may be decreased because ofatumumab is a human antibody that depletes B cells in patients already immunocompromised by CLL. In the pivotal clinical study (Hx-CD20-406), serum samples from 154 CLL patients treated with Arzerra were tested for anti-ofatumumab antibodies. Of these patients, 85 had completed the full course of 12 infusions; including 33 patients in whom plasma ofatumumab concentrations had decreased sufficiently to allow detection of anti- ofatumumab antibodies were they to be present. All subjects tested negative for anti-ofatumumab antibodies.' GSK will continue to assess the incidence of formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies using a bridging design ELISA assay in ongoing and future clinical studies.

'Pregnancy There are no data from the use of ofatumumab in pregnant women. The effect on human pregnancy is unknown. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for at least twelve months after the last ofatumumab treatment. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maternal toxicity, pregnancy or embryonal/foetal development (see Section 5.3). Lactation The safe use of ofatumumab in humans during lactation has not been established. The excretion of ofatumumab in milk has not been studied in animals. It is not known whether ofatumumab is secreted in human milk; however, human IgG is secreted in human milk. Published data suggest that neonatal and infant consumption of breast milk does not result in substantial absorption of these maternal antibodies into circulation. Breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of treatment with Arzerra unless the possible benefit outweighs the possible risk. product no longer authorised |

The  binding  of  ofatumumab  to  the  membrane-proximal  epitope  of  the  CD20  molecule  induces recruitment  and  activation  of  the  complement  pathway  at  the  cell  surface,  leading  to  complementdependent cytotoxicity and resultant lysis of tumour cells.  Ofatumumab has been shown to induce appreciable lysis of cells with high expression levels of complement defence molecules.  Ofatumumab has also been shown to induce cell lysis in both high and low CD20 expressing cells and in rituximabresistant cells.  In addition, the binding of ofatumumab allows the recruitment of natural killer cells allowing the induction of cell death through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the defined conditions  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Commitments are made by the applicant to update some missing information, which does not impact on the risk benefit assessment of the mAb. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Ofatumumab  is  a  human  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1)  that  binds  specifically  to  a  distinct  epitope encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule.  The CD20 molecule is  a  transmembrane  phosphoprotein  expressed  on  B  lymphocytes  from  the  pre-B  to  mature  B lymphocyte stage and on B cell tumours.  The B cell tumours include CLL, that generally expresses lower levels of CD20, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with high CD20 expression occurring on &gt;90% tumours.    The  CD20  molecule  is  not  shed  from  the  cell  surface  and  is  not  internalised  following antibody binding. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans.

Intravenous  and  subcutaneous  administration  to  monkeys  resulted  in  the  expected  depletion  of peripheral and lymphoid tissue B cell counts with no associated toxicological findings. As anticipated, a reduction in the IgG humoral immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin was noted, but there were  no  effects  on  delayed-type  hypersensitivity  responses.    In  a  few  animals,  increased  red  cell destruction occurred as a result of monkey anti-drug antibodies coating the red cells. A corresponding

increase in reticulocyte counts seen in these monkeys was indicative of a regenerative response in the bone marrow.

Intravenous  administration  of  ofatumumab  to  pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  at  100 mg/kg  once weekly from days 20 to 50 of gestation did not elicit maternal or foetal toxicity or teratogenicity.  At day 100 of gestation, as expected, B-cells were depleted in foetal cord blood and foetal splenic tissues.

As  ofatumumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been conducted with ofatumumab.

## Efficacy

The  planned  interim  analysis  of  an  ongoing  pivotal  study  Hx-CD20-406  (single-arm,  open-label, multicentre), and one completed supportive study, Hx-CD20-402  (open-label, dose ranging, multicentre) supported the efficacy of ofatumumab in the treatment of CLL. In  the  pivotal  trial,  ofatumumab  was  administered  as  a  monotherapy  to  154  patients  with  CLL.  Of these  154  patients,  138  were  refractory  to  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab  therapy  (n=59),  or  were refractory to fludarabine and had bulky lymphadenopathy (defined as at least one lymph node &gt; 5cm) and  were  inappropriate  for  alemtuzumab  therapy  (bulky  fludarabine  refractory,  n=79).    Patients received 300 mg Arzerra in the first infusion and 2000 mg Arzerra for all subsequent infusions.  The infusion schedule was 8 consecutive weekly infusions, followed 5 weeks later by a single infusion for the following 4 consecutive months.  The primary endpoint of this ongoing study was response rate over  a  24 week  period.    The  overall  response  rates  were  58%  in  the  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab refractory  group  and  47%  in  the  bulky  fludarabine  refractory  group.  All  responses  were  partial remissions, with the exception of one patient in the bulky fludarabine refractory group who achieved a complete remission. In  the  supportive  trial,  33 patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  CLL  received  4  weekly  infusions  of ofatumumab with 27/33 in the highest dose group (1st dose: 500 mg; 2nd, 3rd and 4th dose: 2000 mg). Treatment  with  ofatumumab  led  to  a  50%  objective  response  rate  in  the  highest  dose  group  and included 12 partial remissions and one nodular partial remission. Safety Infections and infusion reactions occurred in 70% and 64%, respectively, of ofatumumab treated CLL patients  in  the  pivotal  trial  Hx-CD20-406.  Other  common  adverse  events  were:  pyrexia,  cough, diarrhoea, neutropenia, anaemia, fatigue and dyspnoea. Infusion reactions occurred with the greatest incidence  (44%)  on  the  first  infusion  day  (300  mg  or  500  mg),  decreased  to  26%  with  the  second infusion  (2000 mg)  and  declined  further  during  subsequent  infusions  (2000 mg).  A  total  of  21%  of subjects  in  the  pivotal  trial  had  an  adverse  event  in  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  that  was considered related to treatment. Symptoms that characterize infusion reactions were considered drugrelated in 47% of the subjects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most common serious adverse events observed in CLL clinical trials with ofatumumab  included infections,  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The  majority  of  deaths  occurred  in  the  course  of infection,  although  it  is  noted  that  the  disease  also  predisposes  to  infection  and  the  minority  of infections and infectious deaths were considered related to ofatumumab treatment.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in CLL clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Ofatumumab  treatment  was  accompanied  by  a  high  response  rate  in  CLL  patients  refractory  to fludarabine and alemtuzumab treatment (58%) and a slightly lower response rate (47%) in fludarabine refractory bulky lymphadenopathy patients for whom aletuzumab therapy is considered inappropriate. At  the  same  time,  the  use  of  ofatumumab  was  accompanied  by  serious  and  life-threatening complications (infections and neutropenia), which, however, are also manifestations of the underlying disease,  so  that  the  safety  profile  does  not  cause  particular  concern  overall.  Having  considered  the argumentation  put  forward  by  the  Applicant  and  the  recommendation  of  the  oncology  Scientific Advisory group (SAG), the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk of ofatumumab is positive for the double  (fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab)  refractory  population  but  not  for  the  fludarabine  refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy population. However, there is a need to further confirm the positive benefitrisk in the double refractory population through the conduct of controlled trials in CLL disease settings in which such trials are feasible (fludarabine refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy population and earlier lines  of  therapy).  Thus,  the  CHMP  proposed  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation,  after  having consulted the applicant. The CHMP considered that ofatumumab is both a medicinal product which aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and an orphan medicinal product, and therefore falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006. Moreover, the CHMP considered that ofatumumab fulfils the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 based on the following grounds:

(c) Currently there are no approved treatment options for fludarabine and alemtzumab refractory CLL patients. Ofatumumab has shown a high response rate and this effect was clinically significant in this patient population. In accordance with the definition of Article 4, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006,  the  medicinal  product  concerned  will  be  of  major  therapeutic  advantage  to  those affected. Therefore, unmet medical needs will be fulfilled.

(a) Efficacy in terms of response rate was demonstrated in a pivotal and a supportive open label, single  arm  trials  conducted  in  fludarabine  and  alemtuzumab  double-efractory  patients.  Overall,  a response rate of 58% was observed. Treatment with ofatumumab was associated with adverse events indistinguishable from the underlying disease which don't give rise to particular concern. Therefore, the risk-benefit balance  of the medicinal  product,  as defined  in Article 1(28a)  of Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive. (b) There is a need to gain more understanding about the benefit-risk profile of ofatumumab. To this end, the applicant will provide comprehensive clinical data from ongoing Phase III randomised, controlled clinical studies in earlier disease settings. In addition, it is important to further confirm the high  response  rate  and  control  of  the  disease  in  the  refractory  setting  through  controlled  trials  and extended ofatumumab treatment. The applicant will conduct a controlled trial comparing ofatumumab against physician's choice in fludarabine refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy patients. After 24 weeks of  treatment,  patients  on  the  ofatumumab  arm  will  be  further  randomised  to  either  extended ofatumumab  treatment  or  to  observation  alone.  Finally,  the  applicant  will  conduct  a  Phase  IV observational  study.  The  applicant  has  provided  draft  proposals  and  estimated  timelines  as  well  as assurance about the feasibility of the last two studies. The timelines of these studies will be confirmed upon  submission  of  the  final  study  protocols  within  three  months  of  the  conditional  marketing authorisation  date.  Thus,  it  is  likely  that  the  applicant  will  be  in  a  position  to  provide  the comprehensive clinical data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

(d) In  view  of  the  favourable  benefit-risk  profile,  the  immediate  availability  on  the  market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Arzerra in the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)  in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab  was  favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation.
