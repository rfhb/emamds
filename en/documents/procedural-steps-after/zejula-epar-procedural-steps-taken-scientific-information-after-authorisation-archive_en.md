| II/0056 | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy and safety information based on the final results from the PRIMA study (PR-30-5017- C), an annex II.D PAES, in order to fulfil ANX 005; this is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of niraparib maintenance treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer following response on front-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The RMP version 11.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes throughout the PI. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 27/03/2025 | SmPC and Annex II | Clinical efficacy and safety First-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment The primary endpoint in the PRIMA study was progression- free survival (PFS), as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST, version 1.1. PFS testing was performed hierarchically: first in the HR-deficient population, then in the overall population. Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2) and overall survival (OS) (Table 5). The median age was 62 years among patients randomised to niraparib (range 32 to 85 years) or placebo (range 33 to 88 years). […] PRIMA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomised to niraparib as compared with placebo in the HR-deficient and overall population (Table 5, and Figures 1 and 2). Efficacy results for the final analysis of OS data are presented in Table 5. PFS subgroup analyses […] The median PFS in the HR-proficient population (n = 249) was 8.1 months for patients randomised to Zejula compared with 5.4 months for placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94). […] OS subgroup analyses In the subgroup of HR-deficient patients with BRCA mutation ovarian cancer (n = 223), an OS hazard ratio of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.41) was observed. In the subgroup |

At the final analysis of overall survival, the median OS in the gBRCAmut cohort (n = 203) was 40.9 months for patients treated with niraparib compared with 38.1 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.20). The cohort maturity for the gBRCAmut cohort was 76%. The median OS in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (n = 350) was 31.0 months for patients treated with niraparib compared with 34.8 months for patients on placebo (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.37). The cohort maturity for the non-gBRCAmut cohort was 79%. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with Zejula monotherapy or combination therapy in clinical trials and post-marketing. In the NOVA trial, the incidence of MDS/AML was higher in the gBRCAmut cohort (7.4%) than in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (1.7%). For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged haematological toxicities, the patient should be referred to a haematologist for further evaluation. If MDS/AML is confirmed Zejula treatment should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. For more information, please refer to the Summary of   |

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet and to introduce editorial changes in SmPC section 4.4.

No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN or any AST and TB > 1.0 x - 1,5 x ULN). For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 1.5 x - 3 x ULN) the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg once daily. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 3 x ULN). Patients with severe hepatic impairment could have increased exposure of niraparib based on data from patients with moderate hepatic impairment and should be carefully monitored. |

| II/0021             | Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add pharmacokinetic interaction information based non- clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update section 5.3 of the SmPC in line with the SmPC guideline. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/06/2020 | 27/10/2020 | SmPC        | Information on multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) has been included in the SmPC based on in vitro results. Niraparib and the major primary metabolite M1 are not substrate of MRP2. Niraparib is not an inhibitor of MRP2. Also, M1 does not appear to be an inhibitor of MRP2. Furthermore, the SmPC is updated to reflect the results from an UGT inhibition study in which niraparib did not exhibit inhibitory effect against the UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) up to 200  M in vitro. Therefore, the potential for a clinically relevant inhibition of UGTs by niraparib is minimal. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. |
