## 1. Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

The  applicant  has  submitted  the  final  clinical  study  report  of  a  recently  completed  phase  IV retrospective observational study (CBC134A2403; EUCORESM) sponsored by Novartis. This study was conducted in 18 countries and enrolled 6,075 patients, including 81 paediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to collect real-world data on the use and clinical outcomes for patients who received Cubicin.

This  study  was  not  designed  for  studying  the  paediatric  population  specifically.  Cubicin  is  not approvedfor  use  in  the  paediatric  population,  however  some  guidelines  recommend  its  use  for managing  MRSA  bacteremia,  infective  IE,  acute  hematogenous  osteomyelitis,  and  septic  arthritis  in pediatric patients.

The applicant had previously submitted a Critical Expert Overview to review the available paediatric results from this study, which was assessed in Dec 2014. No new safety concerns have arisen during this study.

## About the product

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide natural product that is active against Gram positive bacteria only. The  mechanism  of  action  involves  binding  to  bacterial  membranes  of  both  growing  and  stationary phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis.

Daptomycin pharmacokinetics are generally linear and time-independent at doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg administered as a single daily dose by 30-minute intravenous infusion for up to 14 days in healthy volunteers. Steady state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose. Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney.

Cubicin was first authorised via the centralised route in 2006.

## Approved indication(s) and posology

## Indication

Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults:

- Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI).
- Right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus.
- Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) when associated with RIE or with cSSTI.

## Posology

## Adults

- cSSTI without concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: Cubicin 4 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours for 7-14 days or until the infection is resolved

-  cSSTI  with  concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia:  Cubicin  6  mg/kg  is  administered  once every 24 hours. The duration of therapy may need to be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Known or suspected right-sided infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus : Cubicin 6 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours. The duration of therapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations. .

In patients with renal impairment, dose adjustment is needed.

## Paediatric population

The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Cubicin  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  below  18  years  has  not  been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 of the SPC but no recommendation on posology are made.

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that this study is a stand-alone study.

EUCORE was a non-interventional, multicenter, retrospective, patient registry designed to collect realworld outcome data on patients who had received at least one dose of daptomycin for the treatment of a serious Gram-positive bacterial infection.

Annual database locks occurred from 2008 to 2014. Data collected until September 15 of each year (2008 and 2009) or until July 31 (2010 to 2012) were included in these analyses as well as in the final study analysis (2014). These data originated from patients who had completed daptomycin treatment at least 1 month before the end of the collection period and thus had been followed up for 30 days.

The study was designed to allow all sites at which patients had been treated with daptomycin and all countries in which Novartis is the MAH for Cubicin to participate. The study was not restricted to adult patients, thus it was open for the collection of data from paediatric patients as well.

## Rapporteurs comments :

The dosages used with in this study for the paediatric patients have not been mentioned. It is assumed the  dosage  used  were  the  same  as  those  used  in  the  three  PK  studies  conducted  previously  in paediatric patients and submitted to EMA:

DAP-PEDS-05-01 (2007):  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  a  single  dose  of  daptomycin  (4 mg/kg) in paediatric patients aged two to seventeen years.

DAP-PEDS-07-02:  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of daptomycin (8 and 10 mg/kg) in paediatric subjects aged two to six years.

DAP-PEDS-09-01:  An  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of daptomycin (4 and 6 mg/kg) in paediatric subjects aged three months to twenty four months.

As the final report is expected very shortly (Jan 2015), the applicant should provide full details of the dosages used, in that report.

The Rapporteur will await the submission of these data.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

## Study population

A total of 81 paediatric patients were included in this registry study. The majority of paediatric patients were male (65.4%), adolescents (56.8%) and Caucasian (92.5%).

The  most  common  primary  infections  were  bacteraemia  (19.8%)  and  cSSTI  (18.5%),  followed  by osteomyelitis (13.6%), endocarditis (12.3%) and foreign body/prosthetic infection (12.3%). The main reason for switching treatment from a previous antibiotic to daptomycin was failure of the previous antibiotic  treatment.  Staphylococcus  aureus  was  the  most  common  primary  pathogen  (23.8% methicillin-resistant, 66.7% methicillin-susceptible and 9.5% methicillin susceptibility unknown).

Safety  assessments  consisted  of  all  AEs,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  with  their  severity  and relationship  to  study  drug,  and  regular  assessments  of  physical  condition,  vital  signs,  weight,  and laboratory parameters. Safety analysis included all patients given at least 1 dose of the study drug.

Six  (7.4%)  out  of  81  paediatric  patients  reported  adverse  events  (rash  (2),  tachycardia  (1), anaphylactic reaction (1), hypersensitivity (1), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (1), osteosarcoma  (1),  acute  renal  failure  (1),  dyspnoea  (1),  and  pulmonary  haemorrhage  (1).  Four patients  had  an  increase  in  CPK  levels  but  none  of  these  patients  reported  myopathy  related  AEs. Three  patients  had  SAEs  that  led  to  pemanent  disontinuation  of  study  drug  (anaphylactic  reaction, pulmonary  haemorrhage  and  death,  acute  renal  failure).  One  patient  died  but  the  death  was considered not related to daptomycin.

## Rapporteurs comments:

Although Cubicin is not approved for use in children, some off-label use is taking place. The doses used vary but the most common is 6mg/kg (as recommended in the IDSA guideline,2011). No new adverse events of concern were identified and the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin.

## 1.2.1. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant had previously submitted only a clinical overview to provide an update. The full study report has been provided now.

There were no new or unexpected safety findings from the 81 paediatric patients enrolled in study CBC134A2403 (EUCORE). Both safety and efficacy results are consistent with those from adult patients obtained in this and previous clinical trials and with data from the literature.

On the basis of the paediatric results of study CBC134A2403, there is no change in the benefit-risk profile of Cubicin for the existing indications. The clinical safety and efficacy findings remain consistent with  the  information  in  the  Novartis  Core  Data  Sheet  and  prescribing  information  for  Cubicin. Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the results of this study at present.

## 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  benefit/risk  balance  remains  positive  in  the  approved  indications  at  present  and  no further  regulatory  action  is  proposed  at  this  stage  relating  to  the  (off-label)  use  in  the paediatric population.
