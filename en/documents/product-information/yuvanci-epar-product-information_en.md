## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Yuvanci is indicated as substitution therapy for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, who are already treated with the combination of macitentan and tadalafil given concurrently as separate tablets.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH.

Posology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommended dose of Yuvanci is one 10 mg/40 mg tablet taken orally once daily.

-  For patients who are currently treated with 10 mg macitentan and 40 mg tadalafil as separate tablets use Yuvanci 10 mg/40 mg tablet
-  For patients who are currently treated with 10 mg macitentan and 20 mg tadalafil as separate tablets use Yuvanci 10 mg/20 mg tablet. The dose may be increased to 10/40 mg once per day, based on tolerability.

Yuvanci should be taken every day at about the same time .

## Missed dose

If the patient misses a dose of Yuvanci, the patient should take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not take two doses at the same time if a dose has been missed.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients over the age of 65 years (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

The use of Yuvanci is not recommended in patients undergoing dialysis or in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). No need to adjust dose for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Yuvanci is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, with or without cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C), or clinically significant elevated hepatic aminotransferases greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (&gt; 3×ULN) (see section 4.3). No need to adjust dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Yuvanci in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been studied. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For oral use.

The film-coated tablets are not breakable and are to be swallowed whole with water, with or without food. The impact of breaking or grinding was not investigated.

## 4.3 Contraindications

-  Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
-  Acute myocardial infarction within the last 90 days.
-  Pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
-  Women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
-  Breastfeeding (see section 4.6).
-  Patients with severe hepatic impairment, with or without cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Baseline values of hepatic aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferases (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferases (ALT) &gt; 3 × ULN) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
-  Severe hypotension (&lt;90/50 mm Hg).
-  Co-administration with nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators (such as riociguat, see section 4.5).
-  Patients with a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Liver function

Elevations of liver aminotransferases (AST and ALT) have been associated with PAH and with endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) (see section 4.8). Yuvanci is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, with or without cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or elevated hepatic aminotransferases greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (&gt; 3 × ULN). Liver enzyme tests should be obtained prior to initiation of Yuvanci (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury and monthly monitoring of ALT and AST is recommended. If sustained, unexplained, clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN, or by clinical symptoms of liver injury (e.g., jaundice), Yuvanci treatment should be discontinued.

Reinitiation of Yuvanci may be considered following the return of hepatic enzyme levels to within the normal range in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of liver injury. The advice of a hepatologist is recommended.

## Use in women of childbearing potential

Yuvanci treatment should only be initiated in women of childbearing potential when the absence of pregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contraception is practised (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). Women should not become pregnant for 1 month after discontinuation of Yuvanci. Monthly pregnancy tests during treatment with Yuvanci are recommended to allow the early detection of pregnancy.

## Haemoglobin concentration

Decrease in haemoglobin concentrations has been associated with endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) including macitentan (see section 4.8). In placebo-controlled studies, macitentan-related decreases in haemoglobin concentration were not progressive, stabilised after the first 4-12 weeks of treatment and remained stable during chronic treatment. Cases of anaemia requiring blood cell transfusion have been reported with macitentan and other ERAs. Initiation of Yuvanci is not recommended in patients with severe anaemia. It is recommended that haemoglobin concentrations be measured prior to initiation of treatment with Yuvanci, and tests repeated during treatment as clinically indicated.

## Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease

Cases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with vasodilators (mainly prostacyclins) when used in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Consequently, if signs of pulmonary oedema occur when Yuvanci is administered in patients with PAH, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered. Since there are no clinical data on administration of Yuvanci to patients with veno-occlusive disease, administration of Yuvanci to such patients is not recommended.

## Vision

Visual defects, including central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors. Most cases of CSCR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resolved spontaneously after stopping tadalafil. Regarding NAION, analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with erectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. All patients taking Yuvanci should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, visual acuity impairment and/or visual distortion, to stop taking Yuvanci and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical studies, and use in these patients is not recommended.

## Decreased or sudden hearing loss

Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension, previous hearing loss history and associated connective tissue diseases) patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing.

## Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis

Priapism has been reported in men treated with PDE5 inhibitors. Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result. Yuvanci should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).

## Renal impairment

There is no experience with the use of Yuvanci in patients undergoing dialysis, therefore Yuvanci is not recommended in this population. The use of Yuvanci in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) Patients with renal impairment may have a higher risk of experiencing hypotension and anaemia during treatment with macitentan. Therefore, monitoring of blood pressure and haemoglobin should be considered during use with Yuvanci.

## Interactions

Use of Yuvanci should be avoided in patients chronically taking potent CYP3A4 inducers and is not recommended in patients taking concomitant potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when Yuvanci is administered concomitantly with both a moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor (see section 4.5).

## Cardiovascular conditions

Use of Yuvanci is not recommended in patients with any of the following cardiovascular conditions since there are no clinical data.

-  clinically significant aortic and mitral valve disease
-  pericardial constriction
-  restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy
-  significant left ventricular dysfunction
-  life-threatening arrhythmias
-  symptomatic coronary artery disease
-  uncontrolled hypertension.

Tadalafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. Physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with certain underlying conditions, such as severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, fluid depletion, autonomic hypotension or patients with resting hypotension, could be adversely affected by such vasodilatory effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients who are taking alpha 1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, the combination of Yuvanci and doxazosin is not recommended.

In the double-blind portion of the A DUE study, cardiac failure events (n=4) were reported within one month of treatment initiation with Yuvanci in patients over 65 years of age not previously treated with PAH-specific medicinal products.  Two cases out of four resolved while on treatment, whereas the other two were discontinued due to other adverse events [a newly established diagnosis of Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (exclusionary as per study protocol) and anaemia].

## Excipients with known effect

Yuvanci contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Pharmacokinetic interactions

Effects of other medicinal products on Yuvanci

## Strong CYP3A4 inducers

Potent inducers of CYP3A4 including rifampicin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and phenytoin may reduce the efficacy of Yuvanci. The concomitant use of Yuvanci should be avoided.

Rifampicin (600 mg daily) reduced the steady-state exposure to macitentan by 79% but did not affect the exposure to the active metabolite.

Rifampicin (600 mg daily), reduced tadalafil AUC by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone (10 mg).

## Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors

The combination of Yuvanci with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and saquinavir is not recommended.

Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) increased exposure to macitentan approximately 2-fold. Exposure to the active metabolite of macitentan was reduced by 26%.

Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax values for tadalafil alone.

Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 4-fold and Cmax by 22%.

Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) single dose exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax.

Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% and decreased Cmax by 30%.

## Dual moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors

Caution should be exercised when Yuvanci is administered concomitantly with moderate dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (e.g., fluconazole and amiodarone).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fluconazole 400 mg daily, a moderate dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, may increase exposure to macitentan approximately 3.8-fold, based on physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. However, there was no clinically relevant change in exposure to the active metabolite of macitentan. The uncertainties of such modelling should be considered.

## Co-administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors

Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ciprofloxacin, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil) and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor (e.g., miconazole and piperine) should be administered with caution if administered concomitantly with Yuvanci.

## Co-administration of moderate CYP3A inhibitors

Cyclosporine A (100 mg twice daily) a combined CYP3A4 and OATP inhibitor, did not alter the steady-state exposure to macitentan and its active metabolite to a clinically relevant extent in in vivo studies.

## Effects of Yuvanci on other medicinal products

## Oral contraceptive pill

In in vivo studies, macitentan 10 mg once daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (norethisterone 1 mg and ethinyl estradiol 35 µg). At steady-state, tadalafil (40 mg once per day) increased ethinylestradiol exposure (AUC) by 26% and Cmax by 70% relative to oral contraceptive administered with placebo. There was no statistically significant effect of tadalafil on levonorgestrel which suggests the effect on ethinylestradiol is due to inhibition of gut sulphation by tadalafil. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain, however, reliable contraception is mandatory for users of Yuvanci (see section 4.6).

## Terbutaline

A similar increase in AUC and Cmax seen with ethinylestradiol may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, probably due to inhibition of gut sulphation by tadalafil. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.

## CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline)

When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5 beats per minute) increase in heart rate.

## CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., R-warfarin)

Macitentan given as multiple doses of 10 mg once daily had no effect on exposure to S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) or R-warfarin (CYP3A4 substrate) after a single dose of 25 mg warfarin. The pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on International Normalised Ratio (INR) was not affected by macitentan. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its active metabolite were not affected by warfarin. Tadalafil (10 and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin , nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin and did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid.

## P-glycoprotein substrates (e.g., digoxin)

Tadalafil (40 mg once per day) had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (P-gp substrate).

## Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate drugs:

In in vivo studies, macitentan 10 mg once daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a BCRP substrate drug (riociguat 1 mg; rosuvastatin 10 mg).

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Nitrates

In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Therefore, administration of Yuvanci to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, such as nitroglycerin, isosorbide and amyl nitrate, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Riociguat

In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Anti-hypertensives (including Calcium channel blockers)

The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore, this combination is not recommended.

In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin.

In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of doxazosin -see above) is, in general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant.

## Alcohol

Alcohol concentrations were not affected by co-administration with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen after co-administration with alcohol. Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or approximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80 kg male), but in some subjects, postural dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were observed. Patients should be made aware of these potential side effects. The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg).

## Prostacyclin and its analogues such as epoprostenol or iloprost

The efficacy and safety of Yuvanci co-administered with prostacyclin or its analogues has not been studied in controlled clinical studies. Therefore, caution is recommended in case of co-administration.

## Treatments for erectile dysfunction

The safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Patients should be informed not to take Yuvanci with these medicinal products.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

Yuvanci treatment should only be initiated in women of childbearing potential when the absence of pregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contraception is practised (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Women should not become pregnant for 1 month after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation of Yuvanci. Monthly pregnancy tests during treatment with Yuvanci are recommended to allow the early detection of pregnancy.

Yuvanci is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception (see section 4.3).

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of Yuvanci in pregnant women.

There are no data from the use of macitentan in pregnant women. Studies with macitentan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is still unknown.

There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women.

Yuvanci is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).

## Breastfeeding

It is unknown whether active substances of Yuvanci are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of macitentan in milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded.

Yuvanci is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see section 4.3).

## Male fertility

The development of testicular tubular atrophy in male animals was observed after treatment with macitentan (see section 5.3). Decreases in sperm count have been observed in patients taking ERAs. Macitentan, like other ERAs, may have an adverse impact on spermatogenesis in men.

Two clinical studies with tadalafil suggested no impairment of fertility in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Yuvanci has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, undesirable effects may occur (e.g., headache, hypotension) that may influence the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be aware of how they react to Yuvanci, before driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions (occurring in the Yuvanci treated patients) from the combined double-blind / open-label A DUE study data were anaemia/haemoglobin decrease (22.2%), oedema/fluid retention (17.3%), and headache (14.1%). In this study, the most common serious adverse event was anaemia (1.1% or 2 patients), followed by palpitations, hypotension, intermenstrual bleeding, oedema/fluid retention and influenza, each reported in 1 patient (0.5%)

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile presented below is based on data for Yuvanci and the known safety profile of the individual components macitentan and tadalafil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety data for Yuvanci was obtained from a double-blind, active controlled, Phase 3 clinical study (A DUE) and an open-label extension in patients with PAH.  The total number of patients receiving Yuvanci was 185 patients with a median exposure to Yuvanci of 59.9 weeks.

Known adverse reactions for macitentan and tadalafil which have not been observed in the A DUE study, are included in table 1 based on the prescribing information for the individual components macitentan and tadalafil.

Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## White blood cells

In the double-blind period of the A DUE study with Yuvanci in patients with PAH, the mean decrease from baseline in leukocytes at week 16 was greater in the Yuvanci compared with macitentan and tadalafil: 1.4 × 10 9 /L in the Yuvanci and 0.5 × 10 9 /L in macitentan and tadalafil arms. In the combined double-blind / open-label phase of the study, treatment with Yuvanci was associated with a decrease in mean leukocyte count of 1.2 × 10 9 /L from baseline to week 47 (106 patients).

In SERAPHIN, macitentan 10 mg monotherapy was associated with a decrease in mean leucocyte count from baseline of 0.7 × 10 9 /L versus no change in placebo-treated patients.

## Platelets

In the double-blind period of the A DUE study with Yuvanci in patients with PAH, the mean decrease from baseline in platelets at week 16 was in the Yuvanci arm was 16.2 × 10 9 /L compared with 19.3 × 10 9 /L and 5.6 × 10 9 /L in macitentan and tadalafil arms, respectively. In the combined doubleblind / open-label phase of the study, treatment with Yuvanci was associated with a decrease in mean platelet count of 16.6 × 10 9 /L from baseline to week 47 (104 patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In SERAPHIN, macitentan 10 mg monotherapy was associated with a decrease in mean platelet count from baseline of 17 × 10 9 /L, versus a mean decrease of 11 × 10 9 /L in placebo-treated patients, respectively.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Macitentan has been administered as a single dose of up to 600 mg to healthy subjects. Adverse reactions of headache, nausea, and vomiting were observed. Tadalafil has been administered as a single dose of up to 500 mg to healthy subjects. Adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses. Based on the individual component data, dialysis is unlikely to be effective. In the event of an overdose, standard supportive measures must be taken, as required.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-hypertensives, anti-hypertensives for pulmonary arterial hypertension ATC code: C02KX54.

## Mechanism of action

Yuvanci is a single tablet combination therapy that contains two oral components with different mechanisms of action to improve pulmonary arterial hypertension: macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i).

Macitentan is an orally active potent endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist, active on both ET A and ET B receptors and approximately 100-fold more selective for ETA as compared to ETB in vitro . Macitentan displays high affinity and sustained occupancy of the ET receptors in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. ET-1 and its receptors (ETA and ETB) mediate a variety of effects such as vasoconstriction, fibrosis, proliferation, hypertrophy and inflammation. In disease conditions such as PAH, the local ET system is upregulated and is involved in vascular hypertrophy and in organ damage.

Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of PDE5, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations within the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of Yuvanci was demonstrated in a multi-national, multi-centre, double-blind, adaptive, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group study (A DUE) in 187 patients with PAH (WHO FC IIIII). The study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Yuvanci to each monotherapy, macitentan or tadalafil. Patients with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of at least 240 dyn×s/cm 5

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were randomised to receive Yuvanci (macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg) (n=108), 10 mg macitentan monotherapy (n=35) or 40 mg tadalafil monotherapy (n=44), once daily.

Patients who were not on a therapeutic PDE-5i dose at baseline, received a 1-week titration period of macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 20 mg.

Patients who received treatment during the double-blind treatment period (n=186) were either treatment-naïve (52.7%) to any PAH specific monotherapy, or on an ERA (17.2%), or a PDE5i (30.1%). Patients enrolled had idiopathic PAH (50.5%), heritable PAH (4.8%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (34.9%), or PAH associated with congenital heart disease (3.2%). The mean age was 50.2 years (range 18-80), 20.4% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age, 22% were male and 61.8% were white. At the time of enrollment, 51.1% of patients were WHO FC II and 48.9% were WHO FC III.

The primary endpoint of the study was change in PVR expressed as the ratio of Week 16 to baseline in patients with PAH, for the comparison of Yuvanci versus the individual monotherapies.

The key secondary endpoint was change in mean 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 16 weeks of therapy in patients with PAH, for the comparison of Yuvanci versus the individual monotherapies.

## Haemodynamics

Treatment with Yuvanci resulted in a statistically significant effect of 0.71 (95% CI 0.61, 0.82, p &lt; 0.0001) representing a 29% reduction in PVR as compared to macitentan, and of 0.72 (95% CI 0.64, 0.80, p &lt; 0.0001) representing a 28% reduction in PVR as compared to tadalafil (Table 2). Consistent efficacy of Yuvanci on the primary endpoint was seen across subgroups of age, sex, race, and baseline WHO FC. Additionally, consistent efficacy was observed in patients who were either treatment-naïve, or previously exposed to an ERA or PDE5i.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Yuvanci in all subsets of the paediatric population in PAH (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The bioavailability of macitentan and tadalafil administered as Yuvanci was comparable to when macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg were co-administered separately; bioequivalence was established following single-dose administration in healthy subjects. Bioequivalence of Yuvanci (10 mg macitentan / 20 mg tadalafil) was also established for the 10 mg macitentan and 20 mg tadalafil individual components.

## Absorption

When Yuvanci (10 mg macitentan/40 mg tadalafil) tablet was administered to healthy subjects with a high-fat meal, no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan was observed and the AUC for tadalafil remained unchanged, while Cmax increased by 45%. This increase in Cmax of tadalafil is not considered clinically significant.

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 20 mg were observed following administration of Yuvanci (macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 20 mg) tablet to healthy subjects following a high-fat, high calorie meal.

## Macitentan

Maximum plasma concentrations of macitentan are achieved about 9 hours after administration.

## Tadalafil

Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of about 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined.

## Distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Macitentan

Macitentan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99%), primarily to albumin and to a lesser extent to alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 are well distributed into tissues as indicated by an apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of approximately 50 L and 40 L for macitentan and ACT-132577, respectively.

## Tadalafil

The mean volume of distribution is approximately 77 L, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by impaired renal function.

Less than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects.

## Biotransformation

## Macitentan

Macitentan has four primary metabolic pathways. Oxidative depropylation of the sulfamide yields a pharmacologically active metabolite. This reaction is dependent on the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), mainly CYP3A4 (approximately 99%) with minor contributions of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The active metabolite circulates in human plasma and may contribute to the pharmacological effect. Other metabolic pathways yield products without pharmacological activity. For these pathways, CYP2C9 plays a predominant role with minor contributions from CYP2C8, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.

## Tadalafil

Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the CYP3A4 isoform. The major circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13 000-fold less potent than tadalafil for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations.

## Elimination

## Macitentan

Plasma concentrations of macitentan and its active metabolite decrease slowly, with an apparent elimination half-life of approximately 16 hours and 48 hours, respectively. Macitentan is only excreted after extensive metabolism. The major excretion route is via urine, accounting for about 50% of the dose.

## Tadalafil

The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 3.4 l/h and the mean half-life is 24 hours in healthy subjects.

Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose).

## Linearity/non-linearity

## Macitentan

After repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of macitentan are dose-proportional up to and including 30 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tadalafil

Over a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg, tadalafil exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose in healthy subjects. Between 20 mg to 40 mg, a less than proportional increase in exposure is observed. During tadalafil 20 mg and 40 mg once daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 5 days, and exposure is approximately 1.5-fold of that after a single dose.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

At their clinical doses, macitentan and tadalafil have no known effect on CYP450 isoforms or transporters.

## Macitentan or tadalafil as a substrate of drug transporters:

Macitentan is not a substrate for P-gp/MDR-1. Macitentan and its active metabolite are not relevant substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 but enter the liver by passive diffusion. Tadalafil is a substrate of P-gp.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of Yuvanci has not been studied in patients with renal impairment.

Exposure to macitentan and its active metabolite was increased by 1.3-and 1.6-fold, respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment. This increase is not considered clinically relevant for macitentan monotherapy.

In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In haemodialysis patients, C max was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

Yuvanci is not recommended in patients undergoing dialysis or in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min). due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), lack of clinical experience and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of Yuvanci has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Exposure to macitentan was decreased by 21%, 34%, and 6% and, for the active metabolite by 20%, 25%, and 25% in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, respectively. This decrease is not considered clinically relevant for macitentan monotherapy.

Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There are limited clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). There are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment.

## Patients with PAH

Exposure to macitentan and its active metabolite in patients with PAH was approximately 1.2-fold, and 1.3-fold higher than in healthy subjects, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Exposure to tadalafil in patients with PAH was 1.3-fold greater than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically relevant.

No clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan and tadalafil are observed in elderly or due to race or gender.

No clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of tadalafil are observed in patients with diabetes.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical studies with Yuvanci have not been performed. The nonclinical toxicology data are based on findings in studies with macitentan and tadalafil individually.

## Macitentan

Intimal thickening of coronary arteries was observed in dogs at 17-fold the human exposure after 4 to 39 weeks of treatment. Due to the species-specific sensitivity and the safety margin, this finding is considered not relevant for humans.

Macitentan was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. Macitentan was not phototoxic in vivo after single dose at exposures of up to 24-fold the human exposure. Carcinogenicity studies of 2 years' duration did not reveal a carcinogenic potential at exposures 18-fold and 116-fold the human exposure in rats and mice, respectively.

Testicular tubular dilatation was observed in chronic toxicity studies with male rats and dogs with safety margins of 11.6 and 5.8, respectively. Tubular dilatation was fully reversible. After 2 years of treatment, testicular tubular atrophy was seen in rats at 4-fold the human exposure. Hypospermatogenesis was observed in the life-long carcinogenicity study in rats and in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs at exposures that provide safety margins of 9.7 in rats and 23 in dogs. The safety margins for fertility were 18 for male and 44 for female rats.

Macitentan was teratogenic in rabbits and rats at all doses tested. In both species there were cardiovascular and mandibular arch fusion abnormalities.

Administration of macitentan to female rats from late pregnancy through lactation at maternal exposures 5-fold the human exposure, caused reduced pup survival and impairment of the reproductive capability of the offspring, which was exposed to macitentan during late intrauterine life and via the milk during the suckling period.

Treatment of juvenile rats from postnatal day 4 to day 114 caused reduced body weight gain leading to secondary effects on development (delay of descensus testis, reversible reduction of long-bone length, prolonged oestrous cycle). Increased pre- and post-implantation loss, decreased mean number of pups, and decreased testis and epididymis weights, were observed at exposures 7-fold the human exposure. Testicular tubular atrophy, and effects on reproductive variables and sperm morphology were recorded at exposures 3.8-fold the human exposure.

## Tadalafil

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Yuvanci is and what it is used for

Yuvanci contains two active substances, macitentan and tadalafil. Macitentan belongs to a class of medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Tadalafil belongs to a class of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i).

Yuvanci is used in adults for the long-term treatment of World Health Organization (WHO) Class II or Class III pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is used as an alternative to taking both macitentan and tadalafil as single tablets.

PAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries). In people with PAH, these arteries get narrower, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through them. This causes people to feel tired, dizzy, and short of breath. The class reflects the seriousness of the disease: patients with Class II PAH have slight limitation of physical activity and those with Class III disease have marked limitation of physical activity.

Yuvanci widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. This lowers the blood pressure, relieves the symptoms and results in an improved ability to do physical activity and improves the course of the disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Yuvanci

## Do not take Yuvanci if you:

-  are allergic to macitentan, tadalafil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
-  have had a heart attack within the last 90 days.
-  are pregnant or if you could become pregnant because you are not using reliable birth control (contraception). See section 2 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'.
-  are breastfeeding. See section 2 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  have severe liver disease or if you have very high levels of liver enzymes in your blood. Talk to your doctor, who will decide whether this medicine is suitable for you.
-  have very low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg).
-  are taking nitrates or riociguat. See section 2 'Other medicines and Yuvanci'
-  have ever had non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION, a condition also described as 'stroke of the eye'), a loss of vision due to reduced blood flow to the eye.

If any of these apply to you, please tell your doctor .

## Warnings and precautions

## You will need laboratory tests before using Yuvanci and during treatment, as indicated by your doctor:

If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start taking Yuvanci and regularly (once a month) during treatment. See section 2 'Pregnancy and breastfeeding'.

Your doctor will take blood to test:

-  whether your liver is working properly
-  whether you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells)

Yuvanci may cause increases in liver enzymes (proteins), which may be a sign that your liver is not working properly. Other signs that your liver may not be working properly include the following symptoms:

-  feeling sick (nausea)
-  vomiting
-  fever
-  pain in your stomach (abdomen)
-  yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
-  dark-coloured urine
-  itching of your skin
-  unusual tiredness or exhaustion (lethargy or fatigue)
-  flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever)

If you notice any of these signs during treatment with Yuvanci, tell your doctor immediately .

Yuvanci may cause anaemia (low levels of red blood cells). If you develop any of the following, which may be symptoms of anaemia, tell your doctor :

-  dizziness
-  tiredness
-  feeling generally unwell
-  weakness
-  fast heart rate,
-  palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be rapid or irregular)
-  pallor

## Before taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have

-  any cardiovascular (having to do with the heart and blood vessels) conditions other than your pulmonary hypertension including:
- o aortic and mitral valve disease (problems with the valves in the heart that can affect blood flow)
- o pericardial constriction (a condition where the pericardium, the sac around the heart, becomes tight, affecting the heart's ability to function correctly)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy (a condition where the heart muscle becomes stiff or weak, leading to problems in pumping blood effectively)
