* E.g. antipyretic, analgesic and/or antihistamine. Caution should be exercised with corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease unless clinically indicated (e.g. treatment of anaphylaxis). Special populations Elderly Crizanlizumab has not been studied in elderly patients. No dose adjustment is required as the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab in adults are not affected by age. Renal impairment Based on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. Hepatic impairment The safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism (i.e. breakdown into peptides and amino acids), and a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in paediatric patients from 6 months to 16 years have not been established. No data are available. There is no relevant use of crizanlizumab in infants aged less than 6 months for the indication of prevention of recurrent vaso-occlusive crises. Method of administration Adakveo should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5% before administration. The diluted solution must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic 0.2 micron in-line filter by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes. It must not be administered by intravenous push or bolus. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Infusion-related reactions In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (defined as occurring during infusion or within 24 hours of the infusion) were observed in 3 patients (2.7%) treated with crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg (see section 4.8). In the post-marketing setting, cases of infusion-related reactions were reported, including severe pain events, differing in location, severity, and/or nature from patient's baseline and requiring hospitalisation in several cases. The majority of these infusion-related reactions occurred during infusion or within a few hours of the completion of the first or second infusion. However, later onset of severe pain events has also been reported, following previous well-tolerated infusions. Some patients have also experienced subsequent complications such as acute chest syndrome and fat embolism, particularly those treated with steroids. Patients should be monitored for, and advised of, signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, which may include pain in various locations, headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, dizziness, pruritus, urticaria, sweating, shortness of breath or wheezing (see section 4.8). In the event of a severe infusion-related reaction, crizanlizumab should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted (see section 4.2). For recommendations on managing mild or moderate infusion-related reactions see section 4.2. Caution should be exercised with corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease unless clinically indicated (e.g. treatment of anaphylaxis). Laboratory test interference: automated platelet counts Interference with automated platelet counts (platelet clumping) has been observed in patients treated with crizanlizumab in clinical studies, in particular when tubes containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were used. This may lead to unevaluable or falsely decreased platelet counts. There is no evidence that crizanlizumab causes a reduction in circulating platelets or has a pro-aggregant effect in vivo . To mitigate the potential for laboratory test interference, it is recommended to run the test as soon as possible (within 4 hours of blood collection) or use citrate tubes. When needed, platelet counts can be estimated via a peripheral blood smear. Excipients with known effect This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Interactions between crizanlizumab and other medicinal products have not been investigated in dedicated studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Therefore, medicinal products that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab. In clinical studies, HU/HC had no effect on crizanlizumab pharmacokinetics in patients.

No effect on exposure of co-administered medicinal products is expected based on the metabolic pathways of monoclonal antibodies.

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (≥10% of patients) in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group were arthralgia, nausea, back pain, pyrexia and abdominal pain. These adverse drug reactions, along with myalgia, musculoskeletal chest pain and diarrhoea, may be signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction when observed during infusion or within 24 hours of an infusion (see section 4.4). Severe events were observed for pyrexia and arthralgia (each 0.9%). Severe pain events as part of infusion-related reactions were reported post-marketing.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There is a limited amount of data from the use of Adakveo in pregnant women. Based on data from animal studies, crizanlizumab has the potential to cause foetal losses when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Adakveo during pregnancy and in woman of childbearing potential not using contraception. To help determine the effects in pregnant women, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report all pregnancy cases and complications during pregnancy (from 105 days prior to the last menstrual period onward) to the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder (see package leaflet), in order to allow monitoring of these patients through the PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring programme (PRIM). In addition, all adverse pregnancy events should be reported via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether crizanlizumab is excreted in human milk after administration of Adakveo. There are no data on the effects of crizanlizumab on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk production. Because many medicinal products, including antibodies, can be excreted in human milk, a risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Adakveo therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility There are no data on the effect of Adakveo on human fertility. Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under crizanlizumab treatment (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Adakveo may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness, fatigue and somnolence may occur following administration of crizanlizumab. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in patients aged 16 and 17 years are expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of crizanlizumab was evaluated in 3 patients aged &lt;18 years.

Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Table 2 Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance *The following groupings contain the following MedDRA preferred terms: -Abdominal pain: abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal tenderness -Pruritus: pruritus and vulvovaginal pruritus -Infusion site reaction: infusion site extravasation, infusion site pain, and infusion site swelling # Pain in various locations occurring during infusion or within 24 hours of the infusion (e.g. potential infusion related reaction). This includes but is not limited to abdominal pain, arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, chest pain, general body pain, headache, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain in extremity. See section 4.4. Description of selected adverse reactions Immunogenicity In clinical studies, treatment-induced anti-crizanlizumab antibodies were transiently detected in 1 patient (0.9%) among the 111 patients who received Adakveo 5 mg/kg. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or of an altered safety profile with anti-crizanlizumab antibody development. Paediatric population Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

In this study, VOCs were defined as those leading to a healthcare visit, which captured all acute episodes of pain with no other cause than a vaso-occlusive event that required a healthcare visit and treatment with oral or parenteral opioids or parenteral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration and priapism (requiring a healthcare visit), by definition, were also considered VOCs.

4.9 Overdose No cases of overdose have been reported in clinical studies. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected overdose. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX01 Mechanism of action Crizanlizumab is a selective IgG2 kappa humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to P-selectin with high affinity and blocks the interaction with its ligands, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1. Crizanlizumab can also dissociate preformed P-selectin/PSGL-1 complex. P-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed on activated endothelial cells and platelets. It plays an essential role in the initial recruitment of leukocytes and the aggregation of platelets to the site of vascular injury during inflammation. In the chronic pro-inflammatory state associated with sickle cell disease, P-selectin is over-expressed and circulating blood cells and the endothelium are activated and become hyperadhesive. P-selectin-mediated multi-cellular adhesion is a key factor in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Elevated levels of P-selectin are found in patients with sickle cell disease. Binding P-selectin on the surface of the activated endothelium and platelets has been shown to effectively block interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, red blood cells and leukocytes, thereby preventing vaso-occlusion. Pharmacodynamic effects Throughout clinical studies, treatment with crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg resulted in dose-dependent, immediate and sustained P-selectin inhibition (as measured ex vivo ) in patients with sickle cell disease. Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy of crizanlizumab, with or without HU/HC, was evaluated in the pivotal study SUSTAIN, a 52-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical study in sickle cell disease patients with a history of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 198 sickle cell disease patients aged 16 to 63 years (inclusive; mean age 30.1±10.3 years), with any sickle cell disease genotype (including HbSS [71.2%], HbSC [16.2%],

HbSbeta0-thalassaemia [6.1%], HbSbeta+-thalassaemia [5.1%], and others [1.5%]) and a history of between 2 and 10 VOCs in the previous 12 months (62.6% and 37.4% of the patients had 2-4 or 5-10 VOCs, respectively), were randomised 1:1:1 to Adakveo 5 mg/kg, Adakveo 2.5 mg/kg or placebo. The majority of patients were Black or African American (91.9%). Patients received Adakveo with (62.1%) or without (37.9%) HU/HC. Randomisation was stratified by patients already receiving HU/HC (Y/N) and by number of VOCs in the previous 12 months (2 to 4, 5 to 10). Patients were allowed to take medicinal products to relieve pain (i.e. paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids) and to receive occasional transfusions on an 'as needed' basis. Patients participating in a chronic transfusion programme (pre-planned series of transfusions for prophylactic purposes) were excluded from the study.

Treatment with Adakveo 5 mg/kg resulted in a 45.3% lower median annual rate of VOCs compared to placebo (Hodges-Lehmann, median absolute difference of -1.01 compared with placebo, 95% CI [-2.00, 0.00]), which was statistically significant (p=0.010). The median annual rates of uncomplicated VOCs (any VOCs as defined above, excluding acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration or priapism) and days hospitalised were 62.9% and 41.8% lower in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg than in the placebo group, respectively. The VOCs occurring during the study were assessed by an independent review committee. Main efficacy outcomes of the pivotal SUSTAIN study are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 Results from SUSTAIN clinical study in sickle cell disease The primary (annual rate of VOC leading to healthcare visit) and key secondary (annual rate of days hospitalised) endpoints were the only ones formally tested for statistical significance according to protocol. The clinical effect demonstrated in the primary efficacy analysis was supported by multiple supplementary analyses including a negative binomial regression on investigator assessments with a conservative method to handle missing data due to early discontinuation of treatment based on outcomes in the placebo group (RR=0.74, 95% CI=0.52, 1.06). In the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group, clinically significant reductions in the annual rate of VOCs were observed across important subgroups (HU/HC use, 2-4 or 5-10 VOCs in the previous 12 months, and HbSS or non-HbSS genotypes; see Table 4).

A greater than two-fold increase in the proportion of patients with no VOC and who completed the study was observed in the Adakveo 5 mg/kg group compared to placebo (22% vs 8%; odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.57 [1.20, 10.63]). A similar difference was also observed across important subgroups (HU/HC use, genotype). Treatment with Adakveo 5 mg/kg was also associated with a three-fold longer Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to first VOC compared with placebo (4.07 vs 1.38 months; HR=0.495, 95% CI: 0.331, 0.741) (Figure 1) and a two-fold longer median time from randomisation to second VOC compared to placebo (10.32 vs 5.09 months; HR=0.534, 95% CI: 0.329, 0.866).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Adakveo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of sickle cell disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). Conditional approval This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption The median time to reach maximum serum concentration of crizanlizumab (Tmax) was 1.92 hours at steady state following intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg over a period of 30 minutes in sickle cell disease patients. Distribution Crizanlizumab distribution is typical of endogenous human antibodies within the vascular and extracellular spaces. The volume of distribution (Vz) was 4.26 litres after a single 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of crizanlizumab in healthy volunteers. Biotransformation Antibodies are primarily eliminated via proteolysis by lysosomal enzymes in the liver to small peptides and amino acids. Elimination In healthy volunteers, the mean terminal elimination half-life (T½) was 10.6 days and the mean clearance was 11.7 ml/h at crizanlizumab dose level 5 mg/kg. In patients with sickle cell disease, the mean elimination T½ during the dosing interval was 11.2 days. Linearity/non-linearity The exposure to crizanlizumab (mean Cmax, AUClast, or AUCinf) increased in non-linear manner over the dose range of 0.2 to 8 mg/kg in healthy volunteers. Special populations Renal impairment Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a population PK analysis in patients with eGFR ranging from 35 to 202 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , no clinically important differences in the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab were found between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of crizanlizumab in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is cleared via catabolism (i.e. breakdown into peptides and amino acids), and a change in dose is not expected to be required for patients with hepatic impairment.

Paediatric population Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been investigated. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, tissue cross-reactivity and repeated dose toxicity. In the 26-week repeated dose toxicity study, administration of crizanlizumab in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/dose once every 4 weeks (at least 13.5 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg once every four weeks) was generally well tolerated. There were no primary crizanlizumab-related findings on any endpoint evaluated. At 50 mg/kg, minimal to moderate inflammation of the vessels in multiple tissues considered to be an antigen-antibody complex reaction (primate antihuman antibody) was observed in 2 of 10 animals. There was one death attributed to aspiration of gastric contents following a peri-infusional reaction mediated by anti-drug-antibody-dependent hypersensitivity. Pharmacological effects of crizanlizumab on haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters in the cynomolgus monkey were evaluated in the 26-week repeated dose toxicology study. Respiratory rate and neurological parameters were also assessed. There were no crizanlizumab-related effects on arterial blood pressure or on heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT, and heart rate corrected QT (QTc) intervals on the electrocardiograms (ECG). No rhythm abnormalities or qualitative changes were observed during the qualitative ECG assessment. There were no crizanlizumab-related effects on respiration rate or any neurological parameter evaluated. Formal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted with crizanlizumab. In a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys were administered crizanlizumab once every 4 weeks at doses up to 50 mg/kg (at least 13.5 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg once every four weeks). There were no adverse effects of crizanlizumab on male and female reproductive organs. In an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys, pregnant animals received intravenous crizanlizumab once every two weeks during the period of organogenesis, at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg (approximately 2.8 and 16 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg/dose once every four weeks, respectively). No maternal toxicity was observed. There was an increase in foetal loss (abortions or stillbirths) at both doses and this was higher in the third trimester. The cause of the foetal losses in monkeys is unknown but may be due to the development of anti-drug antibodies against crizanlizumab. There were no effects on infant growth and development during the 6 months postpartum that were attributable to crizanlizumab. Measurable crizanlizumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at postnatal day 28, confirming that crizanlizumab, like other IgG antibodies, crosses the placental barrier.

## Preparing the infusion

The diluted solution for infusion should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic techniques. The total dose and required volume of Adakveo depend on the patient's body weight; 5 mg of crizanlizumab is administered per kg body weight. The volume to be used for the preparation of the infusion is calculated according to the following equation: Volume (ml) = Patient's body weight (kg) x prescribed dose [5 mg/kg] Concentration of Adakveo [10 mg/ml] 1. Obtain the number of vials required to deliver the prescribed dose and bring them to room temperature (for a maximum of 4 hours). One vial is needed for every 10 ml of Adakveo (see below table). 2. Visually inspect the vials. -The solution in the vials should be clear to opalescent. Do not use if particles are present in the solution. -The solution should be colourless or may have a slight brownish-yellow tint. 3. Withdraw a volume equal to the required volume of Adakveo from a 100 ml infusion bag containing either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5% and discard. -No incompatibilities between the diluted Adakveo solution and infusion bags composed of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) have been observed. 4. Withdraw the necessary volume of Adakveo from the vials and inject slowly into the previously prepared infusion bag. The solution must not be mixed or co-administered with other medicinal products through the same intravenous line. Keep the volume of Adakveo added to the infusion bag in the range of 10 ml to 96 ml to obtain a final concentration in the infusion bag within 1 mg/ml to 9.6 mg/ml. Mix the diluted solution by gently inverting the infusion bag. DO NOT SHAKE. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Adakveo 10 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion

## crizanlizumab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Adakveo is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Adakveo 3. How Adakveo is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Adakveo 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Adakveo is and what it is used for What Adakveo is Adakveo contains the active substance crizanlizumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). What Adakveo is used for Adakveo is used to prevent recurrent painful crises occurring in patients aged 16 years and over with sickle cell disease. Adakveo can be given in combination with hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, although it may also be used alone. Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. It causes affected red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and have difficulty passing through small blood vessels. Additionally in sickle cell disease the blood vessels are damaged and sticky due to ongoing chronic inflammation. This leads to blood cells sticking to the blood vessels, causing acute episodes of pain and organ damage. How Adakveo works Patients with sickle cell disease have higher levels of a protein called P-selectin. Adakveo binds P-selectin. This should stop blood cells sticking to the vessel walls and help prevent painful crises. If you have any questions about how Adakveo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor or nurse. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Adakveo

## You must not be given Adakveo:

- -if you are allergic to crizanlizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<!-- image -->

Adakveo could have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. If you experience tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness, do not drive or use machines until you feel better.

Warnings and precautions Infusion-related reactions Medicines of this type (called monoclonal antibodies) are administered into a vein (intravenously) as an infusion. They can cause unwanted reactions (side effects) when they are infused into your body. Such reactions may happen during infusion or within 24 hours of receiving an infusion. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms during infusion or within 24 hours of the infusion, as these may be signs of an infusion-related reaction: -Pain in various locations, headache, fever, chills or shivering, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tiredness, dizziness, itching, hives, sweating, shortness of breath or wheezing. See also section 4, 'Possible side effects'. Your doctor or nurse may monitor you for signs and symptoms of such infusion-related reactions. If you experience an infusion-related reaction, the Adakveo infusion may need to be stopped or slowed down. You may be given additional medicines to treat the symptoms of infusion-related reaction. Your next Adakveo infusions may continue to be given more slowly and/or with medicines to reduce the risk of an infusion-related reaction. Blood tests during Adakveo treatment If you need to have any blood tests, tell the doctor or nurse that you are on treatment with Adakveo. This is important because this treatment may interfere with a laboratory test used to measure the number of platelets in your blood. Children and adolescents Adakveo should not be used in children or adolescents below 16 years of age. Other medicines and Adakveo Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Adakveo has not been tested in pregnant women therefore there is limited information about its safety in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, or are a woman who could become pregnant and is not using contraception, it is not recommended to use Adakveo. It is not known whether Adakveo or its individual ingredients pass into breast milk. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk(s) of Adakveo during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Driving and using machines Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Adakveo contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How Adakveo is given

Adakveo will be given to you by a doctor or nurse.

If you have any questions about how Adakveo is given, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the infusion.

Your doctor will tell you when you will have your infusions and follow-up appointments. How much Adakveo you will be given The recommended dose is 5 mg per kilogram of body weight. You will be given the first infusion at Week 0 and the second infusion two weeks later (Week 2). After that you will be given an infusion every 4 weeks. How the infusion is given Adakveo is administered into a vein (intravenously) as an infusion lasting 30 minutes. Adakveo can be given alone or with hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide. How long Adakveo treatment lasts You should discuss with your doctor how long you will need to receive treatment. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. If you forget a Adakveo infusion It is very important that you receive all your infusions. If you miss an appointment for an infusion, contact your doctor as soon as possible to reschedule.

## Storage of the diluted solution

Chemical and physical in-use stability, from the start of preparation of the diluted solution for infusion until end of infusion, has been demonstrated for up to 8 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C) and at 2°C to 8°C for up to 24 hours overall.

From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, including 4.5 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C) from the start of preparation to completion of the infusion, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. Administration Adakveo diluted solution must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic 0.2 micron in-line filter by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes. No incompatibilities have been observed between Adakveo and infusion sets composed of PVC, PE-lined PVC, polyurethane, and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES), polyamide (PA) or polysulphone (PSU). After administration of Adakveo, flush the line with at least 25 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 5%. Disposal Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Medicinal product no longer authorised
