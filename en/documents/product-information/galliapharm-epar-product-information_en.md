## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

The radionuclide generator contains germanium ( 68 Ge) as mother nuclide which decays to the daughter nuclide gallium ( 68 Ga). The germanium ( 68 Ge) used for the production of the ( 68 Ge/ 68 Ga) generator is no carrier added. The total radioactivity due to germanium ( 68 Ge) and gamma-ray-emitting impurities in the eluate is not more than 0.001 %.

The GalliaPharm 1.11 - 3.70 GBq radionuclide generator is a system for the elution of sterile gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2464. This solution is eluted from a column on which the mother nuclide germanium ( 68 Ge), parent of gallium ( 68 Ga), is fixed. The system is shielded. Physical characteristics of both mother and daughter nuclides are summarised in table 1.

Data derived from nudat (www.nndc.bnl.gov)

5 ml of the eluate from the radionuclide generator with highest strength (3.70 GBq) contains a potential maximum of 3.70 GBq of  68 Ga and 0.000037 GBq (37 kBq) of  68 Ge (0.001 % breakthrough in the eluate). This corresponds to 2.4 ng of gallium and 0.14 ng of germanium.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The quantity of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling Ph.Eur. that may be eluted from the radionuclide generator is dependent on the quantity of germanium ( 68 Ge) present on the date/time of elution, the volume of eluent used (typically 5 ml), and the lapsed time since the previous elution. If mother and daughter nuclides are in equilibrium, more than 60 % of the present gallium ( 68 Ga) activity can be eluted.

Table 2 summarises the activity on the radionuclide generator, the minimum activities obtained by elution at the start of the shelf-life and at the end of the shelf-life as well as the potential maxima of 68 Ga and  68 Ge in the eluate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

This radionuclide generator is not intended for direct use in patients.

The sterile eluate (gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution) from the radionuclide generator GalliaPharm is indicated for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation developed and approved for radiolabelling with such eluate, to be used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

This medicinal product is for use in designated nuclear medicine facilities only and should only be handled by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling.

## Posology

The quantity of the eluate gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution required for radiolabelling and the quantity of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical that is subsequently administered will depend on the kit that is to be radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Paediatric population

Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled with 68 Ga for more information concerning its paediatric use.

## Method of administration

The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is not intended for direct use in patients but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation. The route of administration of the 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical is defined in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the respective kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation and should be adhered to.

For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution should not be administered directly to the patient.

The use of 68 Ga-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

For information on contraindications to particular 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals prepared by radiolabelling with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling is not to be administered directly to the patient but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation.

Unintended direct administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may lead to increased radiation exposure to patients (see sections 4.9, 5.2, and 11). Accidental administration of gallium ( 68 Ga)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chloride solution for radiolabelling containing 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid may also cause local venous irritation and, in case of paravenous injection, tissue necrosis. The catheter or affected area should be irrigated with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection.

Safe handling of GalliaPharm and its eluate in accordance with the instructions in this document should be permanently ensured to protect patients and healthcare professionals from unintentional excess radiation exposure (see sections 6 and 12).

68 Ge breakthrough can increase in the eluate above 0.001 % if the radionuclide generator is not eluted for several days (see section 12). All instructions provided in section 12 should be strictly followed to avoid the risk of excess exposure to 68 Ge.

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The radioactivity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required information.

## General warnings

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

Precautions with respect to environmental hazard are included in section 6.6.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies of the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling with other medicinal products have been performed, because it is used for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products.

For information concerning interactions associated with the use of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient.

## Pregnancy

Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. Only essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and the foetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Before administering a radiopharmaceutical to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breastfeeding. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be interrupted, and the expressed feeds discarded.

Further information concerning the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical in pregnancy and breast-feeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Fertility

Further information concerning the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical concerning fertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Effects on ability to drive and use machines following administration of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Possible adverse reactions following the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical will be dependent on the specific kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Excess radiation exposure may occur if higher than recommended activity of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical is administered to a patient. For further information refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

No toxic effects are to be expected from the free 68 Ga after an inadvertent administration of the eluate. The administered free 68 Ga decays almost completely to stable 68 Zn within a short time (97 % are decayed in 6 hours). During this time, 68 Ga is mainly concentrated in the blood/plasma (bound to transferrin) and in the urine. The patient should be hydrated to increase the excretion of the 68 Ga. Forced diuresis as well as frequent bladder voiding are recommended.

Human radiation dose in case of an inadvertent administration of the eluate should be estimated using the information given in section 11.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals; other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V09X.

The pharmacodynamic properties of  68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical prepared by radiolabelling with the radionuclide generator eluate prior to administration will be dependent on the nature of the carrier molecule to be labelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with GalliaPharm 1.11 - 3.70 GBq radionuclide generator in all subsets of the paediatric population as it is a radiolabelling agent. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is not intended for direct use in patients but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals will depend on the nature of carrier molecules to be radiolabelled.

The absorption, distribution, and excretion of free 68 Ga following direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution were investigated in rats. The rat study has shown that following direct intravenous administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, 68 Ga is slowly cleared from the blood with a biological halflife of 188 h in male and 254 h in female rats. This is because free Ga 3+ likely behaves in a similar way as Fe 3+ . However, as the biological half-life of 68 Ga is much longer than its physical half-life (67.71 min), at 188 h or 254 h almost all 68 Ga anyway decays to inactive 68 Zn. Already in 6 h approx. 97 % of the initial 68 Ga disappear via decay to 68 Zn.

In rats, 68 Ga was excreted predominantly into the urine, with some retention in the liver and kidneys. The organs with the highest 68 Ga activity, other than blood, plasma, and urine, were liver, lungs, spleen, and bones. In female rats, the 68 Ga activity in female genital organs, i.e., uterus and ovaries, was comparable to that seen in the lungs. 68 Ga activity in the testes was very low.

Extrapolating from the rat data, the estimated sex-averaged effective dose resulting from an inadvertently intravenously injected gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride would be 0.0216 mSv/MBq for an adult (see section 11 for more details).

The activity resulting from 68 Ge breakthrough in the rat study was extremely low and is not of clinical importance.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The toxicological properties of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals prepared by in vitro radiolabelling with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution will depend on the nature of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 6.1 List of excipients

Column matrix

Titanium dioxide

Solution for elution

Sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

Radiolabelling of carrier molecules with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.

It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acids should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.

It is recommended not to use uncoated stoppers for the elution vial as they may contain considerable amounts of zinc that is extracted by the acidic eluate.

## 6.3 Shelf life

## Radionuclide generator

18 months from calibration date. The calibration date and the expiry date are stated on the label.

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling

After elution, immediately use the eluate.

Sterile ultrapure hydrochloric acid solution for elution

2 years.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Warm temperatures substantially exceeding 25 °C can reversibly reduce the yield of 68 Ga in the eluate to below 60 %. Therefore, to obtain optimal elution yield (&gt; 60 %), the radionuclide generator should be operated at temperatures not exceeding 25 °C. If the radionuclide generator is routinely stored at higher temperatures, make sure to equilibrate it at &lt; 25 °C for several hours before elution. Elutions at temperatures above 25 °C are nevertheless possible and will not harm the radionuclide generator or have an impact on the quality of the eluate except for the possibly reduced yield of 68 Ga.

Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulations on radioactive materials.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use

The glass column consists of a borosilicate glass tube (type I) and Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) end plugs which are attached to PEEK inlet and outlet lines via HPLC-style fingertight fittings. These lines are connected to two ports that pass through the outer case of the radionuclide generator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The column is contained within the lead shield assembly. The shield assembly is secured in a stainless-steel outer case with two handles.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## General warnings

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used, and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

The radionuclide generator must not be disassembled for any reason as this may damage the internal components and possibly lead to a leak of radioactive material. Also, disassembly of the stainlesssteel case will expose the lead shielding to the operator.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.

The residual activity of the radionuclide generator must be estimated before disposal.

Any unused gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling or radiolabelled medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

The radiation dose received by the various organs following intravenous administration of a 68 Garadiolabelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation being radiolabelled. Information on radiation dosimetry of each different 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical following its administration will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the particular kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation.

The dosimetry tables 3 and 4 below are presented in order to support the assessment of the contribution by unbound 68 Ga to the radiation dose following the administration of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical or of the radiation dose resulting from an inadvertent intravenous injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

The dosimetry estimates were based on a rat distribution study. Time points for measurements were 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, and 180 minutes.

The effective radiation dose of 68 Ga for an adult is 0.0216 mSv/MBq, resulting in an approximate effective radiation dose of 5.6 mSv from an accidental intravenously injected activity of 259 MBq.

ND = not determined as organ/tissue not available in OLINDA/EXM v1.0.

1 calculations made in IDAC-Dose 2.1 v1.01 software.

2  calculations made in OLINDA v1.0 software.

3 sex-averaged dose derived according to ICRP Publication 103.

4 Due to the methodological limitations of the underlying distribution study in rats, it was not feasible to consider urinary bladder content as an explicit source region for the dosimetry. Since gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is excreted predominantly into the urine according to the rat data, the reported effective dose is thus possibly underestimated.

3 sex-averaged dose derived according to ICRP Publication 103.

4 Due to the methodological limitations of the underlying distribution study in rats, it was not feasible to consider urinary bladder content as an explicit source region for the dosimetry. Since gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is excreted predominantly into the urine according to the rat data, the reported effective dose is thus possibly underestimated.

## External radiation exposure

The average surface or contact radiation for the radionuclide generator is less than 0.14 µSv/h per MBq of  68 Ge, but local hot spots of higher radiation can occur. Nevertheless, a 3.70 GBq radionuclide generator will reach an overall average surface dose rate of approx. 518 µSv/h. It is generally recommended that the radionuclide generator is stored within auxiliary shielding to minimise dose to operating personnel.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Elution of the radionuclide generator must be performed in premises complying with the national regulations concerning the safety of use of radioactive products.

The general handling, the attachment of tubing, the exchange of the sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid container, the elution of the generator and other activities potentially exposing the generator to the environment should be undertaken using aseptic techniques in an appropriate clean environment according to current national legislation.

## Preparation

## Unpacking of the radionuclide generator:

1. Check outer shipping package for shipping damage. If damaged, perform radiation wipe survey of the damaged area. If counts exceed 40 counts per second per 100 cm 2 , notify your Radiation Safety Officer.
2. Cut security seal on top of shipping package. Remove the inner foam support from the shipping package. Separate the foam elements carefully.
3. 3.

CAUTION to avoid potential injuries. If radionuclide generator is dropped or if shipping damage extends into the shipping package, check for leaks and perform a wipe survey of the radionuclide generator. Also check for internal damage by slowly tilting the radionuclide generator 90°. Listen for broken/loose parts.

- Carefully remove radionuclide generator. : Drop hazard: The radionuclide generator weighs approx. 14 kg. Handle with care
4. Perform wipe survey of shipping package inserts and radionuclide generator outer surface. If wipes exceed 40 counts per second per 100 cm 2 , notify your Radiation Safety Officer.
5. Check sealed inlet and outlet ports for damage. Do not remove the port plugs before the elution lines are prepared and ready for installation.

## Optimal positioning:

1. When installing the radionuclide generator in its final position, i.e., with a synthesis device or for manual elutions, it is recommended to keep the outlet line as short as possible as the length of this tubing may influence the yield in the receiving/reaction vial. For this reason, the radionuclide generator is supplied with three different lengths of tubing to choose the appropriate length.
2. Local auxiliary shielding is recommended when positioning the radionuclide generator.

Please note: Moving the radionuclide generator after installation in its final position should be avoided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assembly of the radionuclide generator:

Accessories supplied with the radionuclide generator (minimum amounts):

1. 1 x PP - container with the eluent, 250 ml sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid (including a separate hanger for PP-bottles; PP = Polypropylene)
2. 1 x Vented spike (ABS = Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene/PE = Polyethylene).
3. 2 x Adapter 1/16\" to male LUER (PEEK)
4. 2 x Tubing 60 cm (PEEK)
5. 1 x Tubing 40 cm (PEEK)
6. 1 x Tubing 20 cm (PEEK)
7. 3 x Fingertight fitting 1/16\" 10-32 (PEEK)
8. 1 x Fingertight fitting 1/16\" M6 (PEEK)
9. 1 x Stopcock manifold (TPX = Polymethylpentene/HDPE = High Density
9. Polyethylene)
10. 1 x Male LUER union (PP)

Assemble the radionuclide generator in an appropriately clean environment. Aseptic working technique must be maintained during the whole assembly process. Wear gloves during preparation and connecting of the lines to the radionuclide generator and to the eluent container. This is critical for the maintenance of sterility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Assembling the outlet line:

For the outlet line, choose the appropriate length of tubing (20 cm, 40 cm, or 60 cm) based on your local setting.  Use  the  shortest  line  possible.  Attach  the chosen PEEK line (4,5 or 6) to the second adapter 1/16\"  to  male  LUER  (3)  using  a  1/16\"  10-32 fingertight fitting (7) [V] . Put the third 1/16' 10-32 fingertight  fitting  (7)  on  the  other  end  of  the prepared outlet line, but do not connect yet [VI] .

## 3. Connecting the hydrochloric acid container to the inlet line:

Hang  the  PP  -  container  with  the  250 ml  sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid solution close to the inlet port above the radionuclide generator. The valves of the stopcock manifold have a T-type flow pattern with three openings inside - one in each direction of the external prongs. Turn the valves at the stopcock manifold in the appropriate direction (3-6-9 clock position ┳ ) so that no liquid can enter through  the  spike [VII]. Remove  the  lid  of  the vented spike and push the vented spike into the PP container connection [VIII] .

Now the  air  must  be  removed  from  the  stopcock manifold and the attached inlet line. Be aware, that hydrochloric  acid  will  thereby  flow  through  and may  drip  out  of  the  line  and  the  side  ports.  Be prepared to remove the drops immediately.

To remove the air, start by turning both valves of the stopcock manifold as shown in the picture [IX] (the prongs of both valves should be in the 6-9-12 clock position ┫ ). This will fill the inlet line with liquid and push the air out of it. Then turn the upper valve into the 9-12-3 clock position ┻ and remove the cap of  the  upper  side  port  to  remove  the  air [X] . Afterwards, close the upper side port again with the cap. Now turn the upper valve back into the 6-9-12 clock position ┫ . Turn the lower valve into the 912-3 clock position ┻ and remove the cap of the lower  side  port  to  remove  the  air [XI] .  Close  the lower side port again with the cap. Finally, place the upper valve into the 3-6-9 clock position ┳ to stop flow  of  the  liquid  from  the  hydrochloric  acid container [XII] .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Connecting the inlet line to the port of the radionuclide generator:

Remove the plug from the inlet port of the radionuclide generator [XIII]. To connect prepared and filled inlet line using the 1/16\" M6 fingertight fitting,  push  the  line into  the  inlet  port [XIV] and screw  in  the  fingertight  fitting [XV] .  Avoid  hard bending or pinching of the line.

## 5. Connecting the outlet line to the port of the radionuclide generator:

Remove plug from the outlet port of the radionuclide generator [XVI] .  To  connect  prepared  outlet  line using  the  1/16\"  10-32  fingertight  fitting,  push  the line  into  the  outlet  port [XVII] and  screw  in  the fingertight fitting [XVIII] .  Avoid hard bending or pinching of the line.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Please note: The radionuclide generator is designed not to drain itself, when no lines are connected to the inlet and outlet ports, but it is not recommended to leave the ports open at any time.

When the container with the sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid is connected and the fluid path is open, the radionuclide generator will be eluted by gravity. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the inlet and outlet lines as well as the positions of the stopcock valves under control.

## First manual elution:

1. Prepare additional necessary materials:
2. -Personal protective equipment: elutions should be performed while wearing eye and hand protection, and appropriate laboratory cloth.
3. -Sterile syringe with 10 ml volume (avoid syringes with rubber plunger, preferably use twopiece syringes).
4. -Shielded receiving vial or vessel with 10 ml or larger volume. Avoid uncoated stoppers as they may contain considerable amounts of zinc that is extracted by the acidic eluate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Attach the syringe to the upper side port of the stopcock  manifold  and  fill  with  10 ml  of sterile  ultrapure  0.1 mol/l  hydrochloric  acid from the PP - container by turning the valve into  the  shown  position,  then  moving  the plunger of the syringe in the indicated direction  while  avoiding  any  air  inside  the syringe [XIX] .
3. Connect the shielded receiving vessel to the outlet line using the appropriate connector. The vessel must have sufficient capacity to accept the eluate volume. Avoid using metal syringe needles for connection.
4. Turn both valves of stopcock manifold towards  the  inlet  port  of  the  radionuclide generator.  Push  the  10 ml  sterile  ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid at a flow rate not greater than 2 ml/minute [XX] .  Eluting at a faster  flow rate may reduce the shelf-life of the radionuclide generator. Five millilitres of eluent will fully elute the radionuclide

generator,  but  for  the  first  elution  it  is  recommended  to  use  10 ml.  If  high  resistance  is encountered, do not force solution into radionuclide generator. If a peristaltic pump is used for elution, it should be set to a flow rate of not more than 2 ml/minute. The user should also verify that eluent is flowing without unusual resistance. If high resistance is noticed, discontinue elution.

## CAUTION:

Be sure to introduce eluent through the inlet port; do not elute the radionuclide generator in reverse direction.

Elution efficiency ( 68 Ga yield) may be reduced if air is introduced into the radionuclide generator column.

5. Collect eluate in shielded receiving vessel and measure solution with a calibrated dose calibrator to determine the yield. If less than 5 ml of eluate have been collected, measurement may not represent the total potential yield of radionuclide generator. Please decay correct the measured activity to the starting time of the elution. For optimal yield of the radionuclide generator in its final position it is recommended to determine the elution peak by collecting small fractions of 0.5 ml.
6. The first eluate should be discarded due to the potential 68 Ge breakthrough in this eluate.

It is recommended to test the eluate for 68 Ge breakthrough after the first elutions by comparing the activity level of the 68 Ga and the 68 Ge. For further details please refer to Ph. Eur. monograph 2464.

## Routine elution:

## CAUTION:

Free 68 Ge ions can accumulate in the column over time. If the radionuclide generator has not been used for a period of 96 hours or more, the column should be pre-eluted once, at least 7 hours prior to eluting for radiolabelling. If the radiolabelling procedure does not require maximum achievable eluate activity, the time between the pre-elution and the elution for radiolabelling can be reduced (see also table 6 and calculation example below it). The pre-elution should be done using 10 ml of sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Repeat the steps of the first elution but use only 5 ml eluent for the routine elution. The radionuclide generator is designed to elute all of the available 68 Ga activity in a volume of 5 ml.
2. The eluate is a clear, sterile, and colourless gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, with a pH between 0.5 and 2.0 and a radiochemical purity greater than 95 %. Check the clarity of the eluate before use and discard it if the solution is not clear.
3. It is recommended to test the eluate for 68 Ge breakthrough during routine elutions by comparing the activity level of the 68 Ga and the 68 Ge. For further details please refer to Ph. Eur. monograph 2464.

## CAUTION:

If fluid leaks are observed at any time, immediately stop eluting and attempt to contain the leaking fluid.

The radionuclide generator is supplied with 250 ml of sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid. This amount is usually sufficient for at least 40 elutions. The radionuclide generator should only be eluted with sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid supplied by the marketing authorisation holder. Additional containers may be purchased as consumables from the marketing authorisation holder only.

## Exchange of sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid container:

## CAUTION:

Aseptic technique is critical for maintenance of sterility and must be used during the exchange procedure.

1. When the sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid is almost consumed, the empty container can be replaced by a new sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid container.

## CAUTION:

No  air  should  enter  the  radionuclide generator. Before disconnecting the empty container, close all valves at the stopcock manifold and cap the side ports so that no air can enter into the manifold and spike [XXI] .  Disconnect  the  container  from  the vented spike [XXII] . It is recommended to replace the vented spike with the new sterile vented spike supplied with each new sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid container.

<!-- image -->

2. Hang the new container with the 250 ml sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid close to the inlet port above the radionuclide generator.
3. Push the connected vented spike into the container stopper; carefully check for air bubbles and slowly remove all air from the stopcock manifold using the valves. It is not necessary to detach the attached inlet line from the radionuclide generator or from the stopcock manifold. Entering of air into the radionuclide generator should be avoided.
4. When stopcock manifold is filled, close valves to stop flow. The radionuclide generator is now ready for elution again.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Radionuclide generator elution yield:

The activity stated on the label of the radionuclide generator is expressed in 68 Ge available at the calibration date (12:00 CET). The available 68 Ga activity depends on the 68 Ge activity at the time of elution and the elapsed time since the previous elution.

A radionuclide generator in full equilibrium yields more than 60 % of 68 Ga using an elution volume of 5 ml sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid.

The output will decrease with decay of the parent nuclide 68 Ge over time. For example, after 9 months' decay (39 weeks), the 68 Ge will be reduced by 50 % (see table 5). To calculate the current 68 Ge activity, multiply the 68 Ge activity at calibration date with the respective decay factor of the corresponding elapsed time in weeks.

After elution, the 68 Ga will be built up by the continuous decay of the parent 68 Ge. The radionuclide generator requires at least 7 hours to achieve almost full yield after being eluted, but in practice it is also possible to elute the radionuclide generator earlier, depending on its strength and the activity required for radiolabelling. Table 6 shows the build-up factor of 68 Ga activity over time, up to 410 minutes after an elution.

## Calculation examples

A 1.85 GBq radionuclide generator is 12 weeks old. According to table 5, the activity of 68 Ge on the column can be calculated as follows:

- 1.85 GBq × 0.81 = 1.50 GBq

In full equilibrium, the activity of 68 Ga on the column is also 1.50 GBq.

The radionuclide generator is eluted and the collected 68 Ga activity is 1.05 GBq which corresponds to a yield of 70 %.

The same radionuclide generator is eluted 4 hours later. The 7 hours needed to reach the 68 Ge/ 68 Gaequilibrium have not elapsed yet. The 68 Ga activity built up on the column in 4 hours (240 minutes) post-elution can be calculated according to table 6 as follows:

- 1.50 GBq × 0.91 = 1.37 GBq

With a typical yield of 70 % 68 Ga, the collected activity would then be:

- 1.37 GBq × 0.70 = 1.00 GBq

## Note:

The activity of 68 Ga in the eluate can be measured to check the quality with regard to identity and content. The activity should be measured immediately after elution but may also be measured up to 5 half-life periods after elution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the short half-time of 68 Ga (67.71 minutes), the elapsed time between the elution and the measurement of the activity has to be decay-corrected to determine the actual yield at the elution time with the decay chart of 68 Ga, table 7.

## Calculation Example

A new 1.85 GBq radionuclide generator is eluted. The activity of 68 Ga measured 10 minutes after the elution was 1.17 GBq.

The yield at the time of the elution can be obtained by dividing the measured activity by the corresponding decay factor of the elapsed time stated in table 7: 1.17 GBq / 0.90 = 1.30 GBq

This corresponds to a yield of 68 Ga of 70 % at the time of the elution: 1.30 GBq / 1.85 GBq × 100 % = 70 %

## Quality control

If possible, clarity of the solution, pH and the radioactivity should be checked before radiolabelling.

## 68 Ge breakthrough

A small amount of 68 Ge is washed from the radionuclide generator column with each elution. 68 Ge breakthrough is expressed as a percentage of total 68 Ga activity eluted from the column, corrected for decay, and does not exceed 0.001 % of the eluted 68 Ga activity. 68 Ge breakthrough can, however, increase above 0.001 % if the radionuclide generator is not eluted for several days. Therefore, if the radionuclide generator has not been eluted for 96 hours or more, it should be pre-eluted with 10 ml of sterile ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid at least 7 hours prior to the intended use (the time between the pre-elution and the elution for radiolabelling can be reduced if the intended radiolabelling procedure does not require maximum achievable eluate activity). When this instruction is followed, the 68 Ge breakthrough should constantly stay below 0.001 % in eluates obtained for radiolabelling. For testing the 68 Ge breakthrough, the activity levels of 68 Ga and  68 Ge in the eluate should be compared. For further details please refer to Ph. Eur. monograph 2464.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## GalliaPharm 1.11 GBq radionuclide generator

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What GalliaPharm is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm is used
3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm is used
4. Possible side effects
5. How GalliaPharm is stored
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What GalliaPharm is and what it is used for

GalliaPharm is a germanium ( 68 Ge)/gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here  68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm must not be used

- -if you are allergic to gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are using a 68 Ga-labelled medicine, you should read information on contraindications in the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Warnings and precautions

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Children and adolescents

Please speak to your nuclear medicine doctor if you or your child are under 18 years old.

## Other medicines and gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images by your doctor.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breastfeeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

## 3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution produced with GalliaPharm is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling, and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. GalliaPharm will only be used in special controlled areas. The production of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, radiolabelling of a specific carrier medicine, as well as administration of 68 Ga-labelled  medicine to you, will only be handled by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome.

## Administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution and conduct of the procedure

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## 1. What GalliaPharm is and what it is used for

GalliaPharm is a germanium ( 68 Ge)/gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here  68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm must not be used

## 1. What GalliaPharm is and what it is used for

GalliaPharm is a germanium ( 68 Ge)/gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here  68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalliaPharm must not be used

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## After the medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution has been given

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 68 Ga-labelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution than you should, or have received direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution inadvertently An overdose, or inadvertent direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is unlikely, because you will only receive the 68 Ga-labelled medicine precisely controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, or inadvertent direct injection you will receive the appropriate care.

Should you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 1. What GalliaPharm is and what it is used for

GalliaPharm is a germanium ( 68 Ge)/gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here  68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breastfeeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

The nuclear medicine doctor will only administer a 68 Ga-labelled medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.

## If you are breast-feeding

You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines. Please read the Package Leaflets of these medicines carefully.
