## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for PNEUMOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE CONJUGATE VACCINE (7-VALENT, ADSORBED), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Due to the long-standing post marketing experience, the well characterised safety profile and the large exposure of the product the PRAC recommended to amend the PSUR frequency to 10-yearly and to amend Annex II accordingly to reflect the current QRD template sentence referring to the EURD list.
