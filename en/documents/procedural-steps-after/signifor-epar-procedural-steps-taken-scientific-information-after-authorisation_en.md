1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0026            | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2 in order to amend the safety information on SOM230B2126 study 'A phase I, open-label, multicenter, single- dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of subcutaneous (sc) pasireotide in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment compared to a matched control group of healthy volunteers'. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make some additional editorial changes and bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template. The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/07/2016 | 18/11/2016 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Signifor (pasireotide) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed and for the treatment of adult patients with acromegaly for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative and who are inadequately controlled on treatment with another somatostatin analogue. Pasireotide was mainly eliminated as unchanged form in feces and urine. The purpose of this study (SOM230B2126) was to evaluate the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on the PK and safety of pasireotide in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment compared to a matched group of healthy subjects with normal renal function. The product information has been updated to include guidance on use of pasireotide in renally impaired patients based on the final results of the clinical pharmacology study SOM230B2126 and introduce some editorial changes in accordance with the QRD template. |

| II/0012   | Update of SmPC section 4.4 to include guidance regarding monitoring of glucose metabolism in the event of dose increase. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/04/2014   | 19/11/2014 | SmPC | After review of all available safety data regarding the increased risk of developing hyperglycaemia with pasireotide treatment, the MAH proposed to further strengthen the recommendations for glucose monitoring. The underlying mechanism for the increased risk of hyperglycaemia with pasireotide treatment has been well described. In study C2305, performed with the long-acting formulation in acromegalic patients, worsening in glucose metabolic control was observed not only after initiation of therapy but also after dose increases. Therefore the MAH proposed to amend the current wording regarding glucose monitoring in the SmPC with the recommendation to closely monitor blood glucose also after dose increase. This was endorsed by the CHMP and the wording proposed was considered acceptable. No amendment of the Package Leaflet is considered necessary. The benefit/risk balance for Signifor remains positive. |

It is considered possible to generalize the result to all P-gp inhibitors, given that verapamil is considered a strong/moderate P-gp inhibitor. However, in order to predict potential interactions involving pasireotide, the MAH is encouraged to in the future further characterise the biliary elimination of pasireotide. The results of the study do not have any impact on the   |

| II/0005 | Update of SmPC sections 4.5 and 5.2 based on three non-clinical in vitro studies undertaken to further investigate the role of pasireotide as inhibitor of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), multi- drug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to propose minor changes to the instructions for use in the Package Leaflet, to implement editorial changes in the annexes, align Annex II with the latest QRD template (version 8.3) and to update the contact details for the local representative in Malta in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/03/2013 | 12/08/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The MAH have submitted three in vitro studies that investigate the in vitro inhibitory potential of pasireotide of the enzyme UGT1A1 and the transporters BSEP, MRP2, P- gp and BCRP. The studies have been conducted with an acceptable setup and appropriate controls and concentrations have been utilised. Pasireotide was identified as an in vitro inhibitor of all investigated enzymes and transporters. However, the inhibition potency is unlikely to be of any relevance in the clinical setting and therefore no follow-up in vivo interaction studies is necessary. This variation application does not have any impact on the benefit/risk balance of Signifor which remains positive. |
