1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Cases of major bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding have been reported in patients receiving caplacizumab, mainly in those using concomitant anti-platelet agents or anticoagulants. Caplacizumab should be used with caution in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them to a higher risk of bleeding In case of clinically significant bleeding, treatment with Cablivi should be interrupted. If needed, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to correct hemostasis. Cablivi should only be restarted upon the advice of a physician experienced in the management of thrombotic microangiopathies. If Cablivi is restarted, monitor closely for signs of bleeding. In the setting of concomitant use of oral anticoagulants, |

Initiation or continuation of treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC] such as thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors), anti-platelet agents or heparin requires a careful consideration and close clinical monitoring. In patients with coagulopathies Due to a potential increased risk of bleeding, use of Cablivi in patients with underlying coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies) must be accompanied by close clinical monitoring. In patients undergoing surgery If a patient is to undergo elective surgery, an invasive dental procedure or other invasive interventions, the patient must be advised to inform the physician or dentist that they are using caplacizumab and it is recommended to withhold treatment for at least 7 days before the planned intervention. The patient must also notify the physician who supervises the treatment with caplacizumab about the planned procedure. After the risk of surgical bleeding has resolved, and caplacizumab is resumed, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding. If emergency surgery is needed, the use of von Willebrand Factor concentrate is recommended to correct hemostasis. For more information, please refer to the Summary of   |
