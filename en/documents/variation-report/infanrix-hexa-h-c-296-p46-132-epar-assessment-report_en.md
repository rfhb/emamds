<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

BOOSTRIX-049, A phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of Infanrix hexa in healthy infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.

## Description

This was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre, multi-country study with 2 parallel groups. The study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of booster dose of Infanrix hexa in infants who previously completed their primary vaccination series in study BOOSTRIX048.

The study was initiated on September 19th 2016 and completed on March 19th 2019.

## Methods

## Objectives

## 1. Primary

- To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection status for diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliovirus and Hib antigens, and in terms of booster response for the pertussis antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.

## 2. Secondary

- To assess the persistence of antibodies to all vaccine antigens before the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately postdelivery.
- To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of antibody concentrations or titres against all antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.
- To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seropositivity rates against pertussis antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.
- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
- To assess the neurodevelopmental status of infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery, at 9 and 18 months of age.

A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the level defining clinical protection.

The following seroprotection thresholds were applicable:

- Anti-D antibody concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL.
- Anti-T antibody concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL.
- Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥ 8 ED50.
- Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 μg/mL.
- Anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibody concentrations ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL.

A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to the assay cut-off defined in the study ( Table 1 ).

Booster response to the pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) antigens, was defined as:

- -for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cut-off, postvaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the assay cut-off,
- -for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration between the assay cut-off and &lt; 4 times the assay cut-off, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration, and
- -for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the assay cut-off, postvaccination antibody concentration ≥ 2 times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.

## Study design

This was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre, multi-country study with 2 parallel groups (figure 1).

All subjects received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa coadministered with Prevenar 13 between 11-18 months of age according to the routine national/local immunisation schedule or as specified in the study procedure manual (SPM).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blood samples were to be drawn from all subjects before the booster dose administration and one month after the booster dose.

Data collection was done through an electronic case report form.

An IDMC (Independent data monitoring committee) was established to oversee the safety aspects including neurodevelopmental status of infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery in this clinical study.

The intended study duration was approximately 9-10 months, per subject.

N: Maximum Number of subjects planned to be enrolled; Mo: Age in Months

*The neurodevelopmental status was to be recorded when the subject was 9 months and 18 months of age. It was encouraged that subjects who were getting vaccinated at 18 months of age at Visit 2 or coming for Visit 3, complete their Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) during their visit to the study centre. In case subjects completed Visit 3 before 18 months of age, the study staff contacted the parents/LAR(s) via phone and conducted an interview to complete the child's ASQ-3 at 18 months of age. For Czechia, the phone call at 18 months could be replaced by a clinic visit if deemed preferable by the study team. Refer to Section 5.9.4.4 for further details.

**Subjects received either 2 or 3-doses of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 during the course of the study 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI], depending on the nationallocal routine immunisation schedule.

Pre-Bst: Blood sample collected before the booster dose.

Post-Bst: Blood sample collected 1 month after the booster dose.

## Figure 1. Study design

## Study population /Sample size

Healthy male or female infants aged 9 months at the time of enrolment, born to mothers who were vaccinated in BOOSTRIX-047 study and who had completed their primary vaccination series as per protocol requirement in the study BOOSTRIX-048.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A maximum of 680 infants aged 9 months were planned to be enrolled in the study to receive the booster dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 at 11-18 months of age.

Infants were divided in 2 groups in the study as follows:

- dTpa Group: This group comprised infants, born to mothers belonging to the dTpa Group in BOOSTRIX-047 (i.e., mothers who had received a single dose of Boostrix during pregnancy and a dose of placebo immediately post-delivery).
- Control Group: This group comprised infants, born to mothers belonging to the Control Group in study BOOSTRIX-047 (i.e., mothers who had received a single dose of placebo during pregnancy and a dose of Boostrix immediately post-delivery).

## Statistical Methods

1. Analysis of immunogenicity

The primary analysis was based on the According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. As the percentage of enrolled subjects excluded from this ATP cohort was more than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5%, a second analysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort (TVC) was performed to complement the ATP analysis. All analyses were descriptive.

For each group, at each time point that a blood sample result was available:

- Seropositivity rates against PT, FHA and PRN antigens and pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
- Seroprotection rates against diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, HBs, PRP antigen and poliovirus types 1, 2, 3 antigens (with exact 95% CI) were calculated.
- Percentage of subjects with anti-pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) antibody concentrations ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL (invasive pneumococcal disease threshold of protection for electrochemiluminescence GSK assay) was calculated along with its exact 95% CI.
- Percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 IU/mL was calculated along with its exact 95% CI.
- Percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 μg/mL and anti -HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL was calculated along with its exact 95% CI.
- Geometric mean concentration/titre with 95% CI was tabulated for antibodies against each antigen.
- The booster response rates to PT, FHA and PRN (with exact 95% CI) 1 month after the booster dose were calculated.

The above summaries were also provided by primary vaccination schedule, by gestational age and age of the mother at dose 1 in the primary study.

- The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each antigen was displayed using reverse cumulative distribution curves.
- The immunogenicity analysis for the pertussis antigens was generated on the adapted ATP cohort taking in to account all the time points from 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] up to the current study.
2. Analysis of safety

The primary analysis was based on the TVC. All analyses were descriptive.

- The percentage of subjects with at least 1 local AE (solicited or unsolicited), with at least 1 general AE (solicited or unsolicited) and with any AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period was tabulated with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity, for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) leading to medical advice and for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) assessed as causally related to vaccination.
- The incidence of local AEs (solicited and unsolicited) was calculated at each injection site as well as overall (all sites considered) for each group.
- The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE during the 4-day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period was tabulated after the vaccine dose, with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for each individual solicited AE rated as grade 3 in intensity and for each individual solicited AE assessed as causally related to vaccination. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

computations were also done for grade ≥ 2 (solicited AEs only) and grade 3 AEs, for AEs considered related to vaccination (general AEs only), for grade 3 AEs considered related to vaccination (general AEs only) and for AEs that resulted in a medically-attended visit.

- Occurrence of fever and related fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative temperature increments as well as the occurrence of grade 3 fever (&gt;39.0°C axillary temperature) with causal relationship to vaccination.
- The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities. Every verbatim term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects with unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after any dose with its exact 95% CI was tabulated by group, and by preferred term. Similar tabulation was done for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3, for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination and AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study.
- The percentage of subjects who received concomitant medication and antipyretic medication during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period and during the entire study period was tabulated (with exact 95% CI) after the booster dose.
- Any large injection site reaction (defined as any local swelling with diameter &gt;50 mm and/or any noticeable diffuse injection site swelling [diameter not measurable] and/or any noticeable increased circumference of the injected limb) reported during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period after the booster dose was described in detail.
- Subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE from booster vaccination up to study end were described.
- Subjects who reported at least 1 SAE after the end of primary study 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI] and before 201334 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-049 BST: 048] study were described.
- Withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs following vaccinations were described in detail.
- Neurodevelopmental status of the subjects was assessed depending on the ASQ-3 score. The proportion of subjects in the black zone for any domain, for gross motor skills, fine motor skills, communication, problem solving skills and personal-social skills was tabulated. The proportion of infants referred for formal neurodevelopmental evaluation using BSID-III and those with at least 1 indicator of neurodevelopmental impairment using BSID-III was also tabulated. In order to account for subjects who withdrew from the study after Visit 1 (after completion of ASQ-3 questionnaire but had not received booster vaccination), the analysis was to be performed on the Total enrolled cohort.
- The percentage of subjects with congenital anomalies reported across the 3 studies (116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047], 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI] and 201334 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-049 BST: 048) with its exact 95% CI was tabulated by group, and preferred term.

## Assessor's comment

Methods are overall acceptable.

Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are relevant. The seroprotection thresholds proposed as associated with clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis,

Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are appropriate.

The definition of booster response to pertussis antigens is acceptable.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 540 subjects were vaccinated, of which 4 subjects from the dTpa Group were withdrawn from the study (1 subject due to consent withdrawal and 3 subjects were lost to follow-up). Hence, 536 subjects completed the study.

For the ATP analysis, 6 subjects were excluded from safety analysis and further 55 subjects were excluded from immunogenicity analysis (Table 4). Therefore, 534 subjects comprised the ATP cohort for safety and 479 subjects comprised the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

## Asses sor's comment

Similar proportion of subjects were withdrawn from the ATP cohort for safety and for immunogenicity in both groups. ATP cohort for safety consists of 99.3 and 98.6% of the TVC for dTpa and control groups, respectively. ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 87.1 and 90.3% of the TVC for dTpa and control groups, respectively. This is acceptable.

## Baseline data

The demographic characteristics for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity is presented in Table 5. The demographic characteristics of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity were similar to the TVC.

## Assessor's comment

Demographic characteristics are appropriately balanced between groups.

## Efficacy results

1. Immune responses to Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids (Table 6)
- Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 81.2% and 90.2% of subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). The geometric mean concentration (GMC) value for anti-D was lower in dTpa group (0.207) when compared to control group (0.322).
3. Similar proportion of subjects (96.4% and 95.1%) were seroprotected against tetanus respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-T.
- At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , the percentage of subjects seroprotected against diphtheria was 100% in both groups (Primary objective). Slightly lower anti-D GMC value was observed in the dTpa group (6.114) when compared to the control group (8.402).
5. The percentage of subjects seroprotected against tetanus was 100% in both groups (Primary objective). There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-T GMCs.

## Assessor's comment

As expected, the percentage of seroprotected (cut-off of 0.1 IU/ml) subjects against diphtheria before the boost was lower for dTpa group. Around 20%, instead of 10%, of the infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would be susceptible to diphtheria infection during a certain laps of time between post-primary and booster vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus 1 month after the booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa , independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, maternal age and dose schedule of infant's vaccination. Most of the dTpa and control subjects achieved the threshold of 1.0 IU/ml associated with long term protection, even if lower anti-D GMC value was observed in the dTpa group. Conversely, a trend for a lower anti-T GMC value was observed in the control group compared to the dTpa group. These data suggest that the primary vaccination induced adequate immune memory in both group, i.e. independently of maternal immunisation (MI).

2. Immune response to HBs antigen (

## Table 7 )

- Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 94.1% and 94.2% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-HBs.
- At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 99.5% and 99.2% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B respectively in dTpa group and control group (Primary objective). There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-HBs GMCs.

## Assessor's comment

Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off of 10 mIU/ml) against Hepatitis B before and 1 month after the boost with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of vaccination of the mother, the mother's maternal age and the dose schedule of infant's vaccination. Percentages of subjects mounting an Ab response ≥ 100 mIU/ml and GMT were similar between groups suggesting t hat maternal immunization does not interfere with the infant's vaccine induced -protection against Hepatitis B.

3. Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (Table 8)
- Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 88.3-91.7% and 89.5-95.1% of subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-poliovirus Ab.
- At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 100% of subjects were seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 in both groups (Primary objective). There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-poliovirus GMCs.

## Assessor's comment

All the children were seroprotected (cut-off of 8 ED50) against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3  one month after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa , independent of the time of vaccination of the mother, the mother's maternal age and the dose schedule of infant's primary vaccination.

4. Immune responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b PRP (Table 9)
- Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 72.5% and 68.0% of subjects were seroprotected against Hib respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). A trend for slightly lower anti-PRP GMC values were observed in the control group compared to the dTpa group.
- At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , 100% and 99.6% of subjects were seroprotected against Hib respectively in dTpa group and control group (Primary objective). A trend for lower anti-PRP GMC values were observed in the control group compared to the dTpa group.

## Assessor's comment

Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off of 0.15 µg/ml) against Haemophilus influenzae type b 1 month after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of vaccination of the mother , the mother's maternal age and the dose schedule of infant's primary vaccination. Most of the subjects of both groups achieved the Ab threshold associated with long-term protection (1.0 µg/ml).

5. Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) (Table 10)
- Before  the  booster  dose  of Infanrix  hexa ,  68.6-96.4%  and  82.4-98.8%  of  subjects  were seropositive (antibody concentration ≥ assay cut-off) against pertussis antigens respectively in dTpa  group  and  control  group  (Secondary  objective).  The  GMCs  for  the  anti-pertussis antibodies were slightly lower in the dTpa group (anti-PT: 4.4; anti-FHA: 11.2; anti-PRN: 6.9) when compared to control group (anti-PT: 6.3; anti-FHA: 16.5; anti-PRN: 9.6).
- At  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  of Infanrix  hexa ,  the  booster  response  rates  against pertussis antigens was 92.1-98.1 % in dTpa group and 96.7-99.6 % in control group (Primary objective). All subjects in both groups were seropositive (antibody concentration ≥ assay cutoff)  against  pertussis  antigens,  except  for  1  subject  in  the  dTpa  group  who  did  not  reach seropositive antibody level for anti-PT.
- Lower GMCs values were observed in the dTpa group for anti-PT (52.4) and anti-FHA (152.5) when compared to the control group (anti-PT: 80.3; anti-FHA: 187.2). However, lower GMC value in the dTpa group compared to the control group was not observed for anti-PRN (dTpa group: 333.9; control group: 262.3). Large fold increases of the GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster was observed in dTpa group (anti-PT: 11.9-fold, anti-FHA: 13.6-fold, anti-PRN: 48.4-fold), and this in similar ranges as observed in the control group (anti-PT: 12.7fold, anti-FHA: 11.3-fold, anti-PRN: 27.3-fold).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- At  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  of Infanrix  hexa ,  the  difference  of  GMC  values  observed between the dTpa and the control groups was more pronounced for infants that received the study  vaccines  as  a  2-dose  schedule  when  compared  to  the  infants  that  received  the  study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. A difference in anti-PRN GMC was also observed between 2dose schedule dTpa and control groups.
- At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa , differences of anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC values observed between the dTpa and the control groups were more pronounced for infants that were born from younger women (25-34Y).

## Assessor's comment

Since there is no correlate of protection (CoP) regarding the B. pertussis infection, it is considered that the most appropriate way to study a potential effect of maternal immunizati on (MI) on infant's vaccination is to compare the GMC induced by the infant's vaccination in the dTpa and in the control groups. Seropositive rates and booster responses were not considered.

The concentrations of circulating Ab before the boost were comparable (only slightly lower values were observed in the control group compare to the dTpa group) between dTpa and control groups and in the same range than the titers observed in cord blood of infants born from non-vaccinated mothers.

A blunting of the PT- and FHA- Ab responses are however still observed at 1 month post-boost. 95% CI were not overlapping. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa group when compared to the control group.

Large fold increases of the GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster was observed in both dTpa and control groups, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis .

Although the analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results, it is to be noted that the difference of anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC values observed between the dTpa and the control groups was more pronounced for infants that received the study vaccines as a 2-dose schedule when compared to the infants that received the study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. A difference in antiPRN GMC was also observed between 2-dose schedule dTpa and control groups (176.1 vs 233.4 IU/ml).

Nevertheless, in the absence of CoP, the observed blunting of the pertussis response is difficult to interpret in term of clinical relevance.

## 6. Immune responses to Prevenar 13 (Table 11)

- Before the booster dose of Prevenar 13 , 57.8-99.5% and 63.4-100% of subjects were seropositive against pneumococcal antigens respectively in dTpa group and control group. Slightly lower seroprotection rates for 2 serotypes (4 and 18C) were observed in dTpa group when compared to control group. No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-pneumococcal Ab except for both serotypes 4 and 18C for which slightly lower GMCs were observed in dTpa group when compared to control group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- At 1 month after the booster dose of Prevenar13 , in both groups for anti-pneumococcal Ab serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F, &gt;98% of subjects presented antibodies ≥ the assay cut-off and &gt;79% of subjects presented Ab ≥ 0.35 µg/mL. There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-pneumococcal Ab GMCs.

Lower Streptococcus pneumoniae immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 vs 34.2%) in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. Around twofold of the infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would therefore be susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection due to serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain (unknown) laps of time between post-primary and booster vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One month post-boost, similar proportion of infants achieved the threshold associated with protection (0.35 µg/ml) between groups, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother , the mother's maternal age and the dose schedule of infant's primary vaccination.

GMCs were in general slightly lower for infants in dTpa group when compared to infants in control group but CI 95% were always overlapping.

There were no SAEs reported in the dTpa group.
- Withdrawals due to AEs/SAEs: In the dTpa group, the same subject with a fatal outcome was withdrawn from the study after Visit 1. This fatal case was not considered by the investigator as related to the primary vaccination received in BOOSTRIX-048 study and this case occurred before the booster dose administration in the current study.
4. Congenital Anomalies:

During the 3 clinical studies, at least 1 congenital anomaly in infants was reported for 10.4% and 12.9% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. Of which, atrial septal defect was the most frequent congenital anomaly reported in both groups (1.5% in dTpa group and 2.3% in control group).

5. Neurodevelopmental status:
- At 9 or 18 months of age, 11.5% and 11.0% of subjects in the dTpa group and the control group, respectively, reported a score in the black zone for at least 1 domain of ASQ-3.
- At 9 or 18 months of age, 4.61% and 5.84% of subjects in the dTpa group and the control group, respectively, had at least 1 indicator of neurodevelopmental delay.

## Assessor's comment

Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 were generally well tolerated. The safety profile of the Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 co-administration is acceptable and similar between groups.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The study BOOSTRIX-049 was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of Infanrix hexa in healthy infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.

The study is part of a clinical data generation plan consisting of 3 studies that document the maternal vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy with Boostrix (BOOSTRIX-047), and the impact thereof on the response to the infant primary vaccination (BOOSTRIX-048) and toddler booster vaccination (BOOSTRIX-049).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were defined by their serological correlates of protection. The seroprotection thresholds were ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti -D and anti-T antibody (Ab) concentrations, ≥10 mIU/mL for anti -HBs Ab concentrations, ≥8 ED50 for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 Ab titres, ≥0.15 μg/mL for anti -PRP Ab concentrations and ≥ 0.35 µg/mL for anti-PnPS Ab concentrations.

The percentage of seroprotected subjects against diphtheria before the boost was lower for dTpa group (81.2%) when compare to the control group (90.2%). Similarly, lower Streptococcus pneumoniae immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 vs 34.2%) in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. Around twofold of the infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would therefore be susceptible to diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection due to serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain (unknown) laps of time between post-primary and booster vaccination. Only few data are currently available in the literature. Lower anti-D (Maertens 2016, Zimmermann 2019) and lower anti-Pn specific to several serotypes, including 4 and 18C, (Zimmermann 2019) were also observed before the booster dose in infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy compared to infants whose mothers did not receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy. Conversely, no difference in pre-boost anti-D titers were observed between similar groups in Munoz 2014. The MAH is invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological relevance of these observations in the Variation II dossier that will be submitted in March 2020. Changes in the SmPC reflecting these observations would be needed, unless adequately justified by the MAH.

At 1 month after the booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa , all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria, tetanus, and poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3, &gt;94% against hepatitis B, and &gt;99% against Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, maternal age and dose schedule of infant' s vaccination.

In addition most the dTpa and control subjects achieved Ab thresholds associated with long term protection or robust immune responses against tetanus (1.0 IU/ml), hepatitis B (100 mIU/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (1.0 µg/ml). For diphtheria, most of the subjects of both groups also achieved the threshold of 1.0 IU/ml, even if lower anti-D GMC value was observed in the dTpa group. Overall, these data suggest that the primary vaccination induced adequate immune memory in both group, i.e. independently of maternal immunisation (MI).

A trend for lower GMCs of Ab specific to most of the serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae was observed for the dTpa group compared to the control group post-boost. However 95% CI were always overlapping and the percentages of subjects achieving the protective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml to the various serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were generally high (ranging from 79 to 100%) and comparable between groups, suggesting that the subjects of both groups are comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. Thus, the observed (slight) interference of MI on infant's Ab concentration post -booster vaccination is not likely to be clinically relevant in the short term.

One month post-boost, lower PT- and FHA- Ab responses were observed in infants whose mothers did receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy when compare to control infants. 95% CI were not overlapping. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa group when compared to the control group. The observed results are in line with those found in the literature; Lower/trend for lower Ab responses to pertussis antigens were also observed post-boost in Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Maertens 2016a, Maertens 2016b, Halperin 2018. Nevertheless, comparable fold increases of the anti-pertussis antigens GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster were observed in both dTpa and control groups, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis . Yet, even if data of BOOSTRIX-049 study suggest that an immune memory was induced by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the vaccination, it is not known for which duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected.

Although the analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results, it is to be noted that the difference of anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC values observed between the dTpa and the control groups was more pronounced for infants that received the primary vaccination as a 2-dose schedule when compared to the infants that received the study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. A difference in antiPRN GMC was also observed between 2-dose schedule dTpa and control groups (176.1 vs 233.4 IU/ml).

Nevertheless, in the absence of correlate of protection (CoP), the observed blunting of the pertussis response is difficult to interpret in term of clinical relevance and the 'real' (long -term) impact of MI for the infants. As already discussed in the BOOSTRIX-048 AR, the VWP considered that it could be appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa under a heading of Infant immune responses following maternal immunisation (or similar). The section could shortly describe the observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis antigens.

Finally, both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of mother's vaccination (during or post -pregnancy). An update of the section 4.8 would be proposed by the MAH as part of a variation in March 2020.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In the present study, infants born from mother either vaccinated during pregnancy (dTpa group) or post-delivery (control group) and having completed their primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (according to a 2- or 3-dose schedule) were boosted with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 around 15 months of age.

Lower immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4 and 18C in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. The MAH is invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological relevance of these observations in the Variation II dossier that will be submitted in March 2020. Changes in the SmPC reflecting these observations would be needed, unless adequately justified by the MAH.

Immunogenicity results at post-boost timepoint demonstrated that maternal immunization (MI) does not interfere with vaccine-induced seroprotection against diphtheria, tetanus, Hepatitis B, poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b and, Streptococcus pneumoniae .

A slight blunting effect was however observed for diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae inducedimmune responses (in terms of GMT). Nevertheless, 1 month after the booster dose, &gt;99% of the subjects of dTpa group achieved the anti-D Ab threshold associated with long-term protection and comparable percentage of subjects had anti-PnPs Ab titers ≥ 0.35 µg/ml in both groups. It is thus unlikely that the observed interference is clinically relevant in the short term.

Anamnestic responses to pertussis antigens were observed after the boost, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis . It is however not known for which duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected. Indeed, in line with the literature, a blunting effect of the MI on infant vaccine-induced pertussis antibody responses was observed post-boost (in terms of GMT). In the absence of CoP, it is difficult to estimate the clinical relevance of this blunting of pertussis responses and the 'real' (long -term) impact of MI for the infants. As already discussed in the BOOSTRIX-048 assessment report, the VWP considered that it could be appropriate to add the results of the studies in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of mother's vaccination (during or post -pregnancy). An update of the section 4.8 of the SmPC would also be proposed.

The MAH committed to submit a variation in March 2020 in which the outcome of the three maternal vaccination studies dTpa-047, -048 and -049 will be discussed. An update of the product information will be proposed as part of this variation.
