## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Quadramet 1.3 GBq/mL solution for injection.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each mL of solution contains 1.3 GBq of samarium ( 153 Sm) lexidronam pentasodium at the reference date (corresponding to 20 to 80 µg/mL of samarium per vial).

Samarium specific activity is approximately 16 - 65 MBq/µg of samarium.

Each vial contains 2-4 GBq at the reference date.

Samarium-153 emits both medium-energy beta particles and an imageable gamma photon, and has a radioactive half-life of 46.3 hours (1.93 days). The primary radiation emissions of samarium-153 are shown in Table 1.

* Maximum energies are listed for the beta emissions, the average beta particle energy is 233 keV.

Excipient with known effect: sodium 8.1 mg/mL.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection.

Clear, colourless to light amber solution with pH ranging between 7.0 and 8.5.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Quadramet is indicated for the relief of bone pain in patients with multiple painful osteoblastic skeletal metastases which take up technetium ( 99m Tc)-labelled bisphosphonates on bone scan.

The presence of osteoblastic metastases which take up technetium  ( 99m Tc)-labelled  bisphosphonates must be confirmed prior to therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Quadramet should only be administered by physicians experienced in the use of radiopharmaceuticals and after full oncological evaluation of the patient by qualified physicians.

## Posology

The recommended activity of Quadramet is 37 MBq per kg body weight.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible in these patients.

## Paediatric population

Quadramet is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.

## Method of administration

## For single use only.

Quadramet is to be administered by slow intravenous route through an established intravenous line over a period of one minute. Quadramet should not be diluted before use.

Patients who respond to Quadramet generally experience the onset of pain relief within 1 week after treatment. Relief of pain may persist for 4 weeks up to 4 months. Patients who experience a reduction in pain may be encouraged by their physician to decrease their use of opioid analgesics.

Repeat administration of Quadramet should be based on an individual patient's response to prior treatment and on clinical symptoms. A minimum interval of 8 weeks should be respected, subject to recovery of adequate bone marrow function.

The data on the safety of repeated dosing are limited and based on compassionate use of the product.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

For patient preparation, see section 4.4.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance (ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate (EDTMP)) or similar phosphonates or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- Pregnancy (See section 4.6).
- Patients having received chemotherapy or hemi-body external radiation therapy in a preceding period of 6 weeks.
- Concomitant use with myelotoxic chemotherapy (see section 4.5)

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions

If hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate action in  emergencies,  the  necessary  medicinal  products  and  equipment  such  as  endotracheal  tube  and ventilator must be immediately available.

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For  each  patient,  the  radiation  exposure  must  be  justifiable  by  the  likely  benefit.  The  activity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect.

In  patients  with  evidence  of  compromised  bone  marrow  reserve  from  previous  therapy  or  disease involvement, the use of Quadramet is not recommended unless the potential benefit of the treatment outweighs its risks.

## Renal impairment

Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

For  information  on  the  use  in  paediatric  population  see  section 4.2.  Careful  consideration  of  the indication is required since the effective dose per MBq is higher than in adults.

It  should  not  be  used  concurrently  with  other  bisphosphonates  if  an  interference  is  shown  on  the technetium ( 99m Tc)-labelled bisphosphonate bone scans.

## Myelosuppression

Treatment of patients with compromised bone marrow function is not recommended. Complete Blood Counts should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to the start of therapy. The following thresholds should be considered prior to initiating therapy:

- Haemoglobin &lt;100 g/L
- Total white cell count &lt;5 × 10 9 /L
- Absolute neutrophil count &lt;2 x 10 9 /L
- Platelet count &lt;100 × 10 9 /L

## Patient preparation

The patient should be encouraged to ingest (or receive by intravenous administration) a minimum of 500 mL of fluids prior to injection and should be encouraged to void as often as possible after injection to minimise radiation exposure to the bladder.

Patients with urinary problems (obstruction or incontinence) should be catheterised after administration to minimise the risk of radioactive contamination of clothing, bed linen, and the patient's environment. Patients' release has to be aligned with local regulations.

The clearance of Quadramet being rapid, the precautions relating to the excreted urinary radioactivity has to be aligned with local regulations.

## After the procedure

Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during 48 hours.

Because of potential bone marrow suppression after administration, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 8 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after administration of Quadramet, or until recovery of adequate bone marrow function.

## Specific warnings

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

Paravenous injection must be avoided due to the risk of local tissue necrosis. Injection should be strictly intravenous to avoid local deposit and irradiation. In the event of paravenous injection, the injection should  be  immediately  stopped  and  the  site  of  injection  should  be  warmed  and  rested  in  elevated position. When radiation necrosis occurs, surgical intervention may be necessary.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Because  of  the  potential  for  additive  effects  on  bone  marrow,  the  treatment  should  not  be  given concurrently  with  chemotherapy  or  external  beam  radiation  therapy.  Quadramet  may  be  given subsequent to either of these treatments after allowing for adequate marrow recovery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has  missed  a  period,  if  the  period  is  very  irregular,  etc.),  alternative  techniques  not  using  ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. The possibility of pregnancy must strictly be ruled out.

## Contraception

Women of childbearing potential and men have to use effective contraception after the administration and the whole period of follow-up.

## Pregnancy

The use of samarium ( 153 Sm) lexidronam pentasodium is contraindicated in pregnant women (see section 4.3).

## Breast-feeding

Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding consideration should be given  to  the  possibility  of  delaying  the  administration  of  radionuclide  until  the  mother  has  ceased breastfeeding.

There  are  no  available  clinical  data  relating  to  the  excretion  of  Quadramet  in  human  milk. If  the administration is considered necessary,  formula feeding should be substituted for breast-feeding and the expressed feeds discarded.

Close contact with infants should be restricted during 48 hours.

## Fertility

No studies on fertility have been performed.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Quadramet may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In clinical studies in individuals who received Quadramet, the most frequently reported reactions were thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia.

The most important serious adverse reactions associated with Quadramet are disseminated intravascular coagulation,  bone  marrow  failure,  hypersensitivity,  anaphylactic  reaction,  intracranial  haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident and spinal cord compression.

1 Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting

2 See section Description of selected adverse reactions

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Post marketing reports of thrombocytopenia have included isolated reports of intracranial haemorrhage, and cases in which the outcome was fatal.

Decreases in  white  blood cell  and  platelet  counts  and  anaemia  were  observed  in  patients  receiving Quadramet.

In clinical trials white blood cell and platelet counts decreased to a nadir of approximately 40 % to 50 % of baseline 3 to 5 weeks after a dose, and generally returned to pre-treatment levels by 8 weeks post treatment.

The few patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 hematopoietic toxicity usually either had a history of recent external beam radiation therapy or chemotherapy or had rapidly progressive disease with probable bone marrow involvement.

A small number of patients have reported a transient increase in bone pain shortly after injection (flare reaction). This is usually mild and self-limiting and occurs within 72 hours of injection. Such reactions are usually responsive to analgesics.

A  few  patients  experienced  cord/root  compressions,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  and cerebrovascular  accidents.  The  occurrence  of  these  events  may  be  linked  to  the  patients'  disease evolution. When there are spinal metastases at the cervico-dorsal level, an increased risk of spinal cord compression cannot be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself. The effective dose is 798 mSv when the maximal recommended activity for a 70 kg weight patient of 2600 MBq is administered.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with Quadramet the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that was applied.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Various pain palliation radiopharmaceuticals. ATC Code: V10BX02

## Mechanism of action

Quadramet has an affinity for skeletal tissue and concentrates in areas of bone turnover in intimate association with hydroxyapatite.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Studies in rats have demonstrated that Quadramet is cleared rapidly from the blood and localises to growing areas of bone matrix, specifically the layer of osteoid undergoing mineralisation.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In  clinical  studies  employing  planar  imaging  techniques,  Quadramet  accumulates  with  a  lesion-tonormal bone ratio of approximately 5 and a lesion-to-soft tissue ratio of approximately 6. Thus, areas of metastatic involvement can accumulate significantly greater amounts of Quadramet than surrounding normal bone.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Distribution

In patients, Quadramet is rapidly cleared from the blood. Thirty minutes after injection of the agent to 22 patients, only 9.6 ± 2.8 % of the administered activity remained in plasma. At 4 and 24 hours, plasma radioactivity had decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7 % to 0.05 ± 0.03 %.

## Organ uptake

Total skeletal uptake of Quadramet in studies of 453 patients with a variety of primary malignancies was  65.5 ± 15.5 %  of  the  administered  activity.  A  positive  correlation  was  found  between  skeletal uptake and the number of metastatic sites. In contrast, skeletal uptake was inversely proportional to plasma radioactivity at 30 minutes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Urinary  excretion  occurred  predominantly  during  the  first  4 hours  (30.3 ± 13.5 %).  At  12 hours, 35.3 ± 13.6 %  of  the  administered  activity  had  been  excreted  into  the  urine.  Less  urinary  excretion occurred in patients who had extensive bony metastases, regardless of the amount of radiopharmaceutical administered.

## Biotransformation

Analysis of urine samples found the radioactivity to be present as the intact complex.

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment has not been characterised.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The radiolysis products of Sm-EDTMP showed a renal toxicity in rats and dogs with a no effect level of 2.5 mg/kg.

Repeated dose administration of samarium ( 153 Sm)-EDTMP to dogs indicated a slightly longer time for depressed  bone  marrow  and  peripheral  haematological  parameters  to  recover  when  compared  to recovery following only single dose administration.

Radioactive Sm-EDTMP has not been tested for mutagenicity/carcinogenicity but due to the radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure it should be regarded as presenting a genotoxic/carcinogenic risk.

Non-radioactive Sm-EDTMP showed no mutagenic potential in a battery of in vivo and in vitro tests. The same results were observed for Sm-EDTMP enriched with radiolysis degradants.

In  a  carcinogenic  potential  study  of  EDTMP,  osteosarcomas  occurred  in  rats  at  high  doses.  In  the absence  of  genotoxic  properties,  these  effects  can  be  assigned  to  the  EDTMP  chelatant  properties leading to osseous metabolism disturbances.

No studies have been performed to assess the effect of Quadramet on reproduction.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## General warning

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

If at any time in the preparation of this product, the integrity of this vial is compromised it should not be used.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting etc.

The preparation is likely to result in a relatively high radiation dose to most patients. The administration of Quadramet may result in significant environmental hazard. This may be of concern to the immediate family of those individuals undergoing treatment or the general public depending on the level of activity administered.

Suitable precautions in accordance with national regulations should be taken concerning the activity eliminated by the patients in order to avoid any contaminations.

Quadramet may contains 154-Eu with a half-life of 8.5 years which will be retained in the skeleton after Quadramet therapy. This should be taken into account for the disposal of radioactive waste and when Radiation Alarm Systems are activated.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient from an intravenous injection of Quadramet are shown in Table 3. The dosimetry estimates were based on clinical biodistribution studies using  methods  developed  for  radiation  dose  calculations  by  the  Medical  Internal  Radiation  Dose (MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine.

Because Quadramet is excreted in the urine, radiation exposure was based on a urinary voiding interval of 4.8 hours. Radiation dose estimates for bone and marrow assume that radioactivity is deposited on bone surfaces, in accordance with autoradiograms of bone samples taken from patients who received Quadramet.

## 1. What Quadramet is and what it is used for

Quadramet contains the active substance samarium ( 153 Sm) lexidronam pentasodium.

This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for therapy only.

Quadramet is used for the treatment of bone pain due to your disease.

Quadramet has a high affinity for skeletal tissue. Once injected it concentrates in bone lesions. Because Quadramet contains small amounts of a radioactive element, samarium ( 153 Sm), radiations is delivered locally to the bone lesions, allowing to develop the palliative action on bone pain.

The use of Quadramet involves exposure to amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweights the risk due to radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before Quadramet is used

## Quadramet must not be used

- If you are allergic to samarium ( 153 Sm) lexidronam pentasodium or similar phosphonate compounds, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6),
- If you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant,
- If you have received chemotherapy or hemibody radiation therapy in a preceding period of 6 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
