| II/0063 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to include the risk of hepatic failure further to the PRAC recommendation as requested in LEG 037. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. Minor changes were also proposed to the labelling. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the | 21/11/2013 | 18/12/2013 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Further to PRAC request, the MAH conducted a cumulative review of cases of hepatic failure and related terms with temozolomide. The review identified 38 cases including fatal outcomes. The CHMP identified 6 additional cases from the literature. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last treatment with temozolomide. As a consequence, it is recommended that baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should be repeated midway during this cycle and for all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each treatment cycle. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated. |

| II/0062   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information with reported cases of fatal respiratory failure and to include pulmonary fibrosis as an adverse drug reaction further to the CHMP request following the assessment of the PSUR 13 (period 13/07/2008 to 12/07/2011). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in the Package Leaflet and to update the list of local representatives. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.2. C.I.3.z - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Other variation | 13/12/2012   | 18/12/2013 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Following the assessment of PSUR 13 (covering the period 13/07/2008 to 12/07/2011), the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH agreed to include pulmonary fibrosis as an adverse drug reaction. However, the MAH submitted a justification for not updating the SmPC to include respiratory failure providing additional information. The CHMP did not agree with the MAH´s justification since available information indicates a causal role of temozolomide for the development of respiratory failure and its associated risk of fatality. Therefore, an update of the SmPC with this information was requested (section 4.4 and 4.8). |

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

The majority of the cases discussed were related to myelosuppression with bone marrow failure, pancytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or aplastic anaemia. As a consequence, the CHMP requested the MAH to include a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to update the product information in line with the latest version of the QRD template (version 7.3.1), to remove the version number of the DDPS in Annex II, to use the short standard term 'powder for infusion' in the small immediate packaging material and to introduce editorial changes. Furthermore, the MAH updated the list of local representatives in the PL. The PLs for hard capsules sachet and bottles was also combined in one. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |     |             | (TMZ) from 9 June 2007 to 12 July 2010 a total of eight cases were identified. Based on the evaluation of this search and on the review of the most recent post- marketing data, in addition to the previously completed assessments, a possible association between TMZ therapy and hepatotoxicity cannot be ruled out. The section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the information on possible risk of hepatotoxicity. The PL has been updated accordingly.   |
