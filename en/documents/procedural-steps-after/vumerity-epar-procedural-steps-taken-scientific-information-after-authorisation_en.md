1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| WS/2587     | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Submission of the final report from Study 109MS401, a multicenter, global, observational study to collect information on safety and to document the drug utilization of Tecfidera (Dimethyl Fumarate) when used in routine medical practice in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ESTEEM), listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (MEA007.6). Section 4.8 is updated to change the frequency category of DILI from 'not known' to 'rare'. The PL is updated accordingly. The EU-RMP for Tecfidera is updated to version 17.0 and the EU-RMP for Vumerity is updated to version 3.0.
