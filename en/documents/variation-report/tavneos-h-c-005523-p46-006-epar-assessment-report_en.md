## 1. Introduction

On 23 March 2023, the MAH submitted a completed study for Tavneos, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that 'A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE)' is a stand alone study. The study enrolled 2 pediatric subjects, both of whom were randomized to receive placebo in the initial double-blind period followed by avacopan in the open-label treatment period. On 21 October 2022, the MAH submitted an abbreviated report of the results of Study CL011\\_168 which was reviewed under Art. 46 (procedure EMA/CHMP/930450/2022).

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was not met, and the MAH does not plan to submit the results of Study CL011\\_168 as a subject of a Variation to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Tavneos.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Avacopan is an orally administered, selective inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor (C5aR). Avacopan 10 mg capsules were administered in the study.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- CL011-168: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Clinical study number and title

CL011-168: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE)

## Description

A clinical trial to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of avacopan in subjects with C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G). Subjects with biopsy-proven C3G with or without a renal transplant, were stratified by elevated or normal levels of C5b-9 and then were randomized 1:1 to receive avacopan or placebo twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks in a double-blind manner followed by open-label avacopan for an additional 26 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Eligible subjects were men and women ≥ 18 years of age with biopsy-proven C3G, either Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) or C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN), with or without a renal transplant. Adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) were enrolled only in countries and at study centers for which respective approval by Regulatory Authorities and Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) was granted. Key exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, women who were pregnant or nursing, tubulointerstitial fibrosis that appears to be more than 50 % , use of eculizumab or another anti-C5 antibody within 26 weeks before dosing, and secondary C3 disease.

## Treatments

The 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, Phase 2 study, included a 26week, double-blind treatment period (Period 1), followed by a 26-week, open-label, active-treatment period (Period 2), and an 8-week off-treatment Period. Study participants were stratified by baseline C5b9 level (&gt;244 ng/mL, ≤244 ng/mL) and randomized 1:1 to avacopan 30 mg BID or placebo for an initial 26-week double-blind treatment period (Period 1). At Week 26, study participants initially randomized to avacopan 30 mg BID remained on this regimen and participants initially randomized to placebo were switched to avacopan 30 mg BID for a 26-week active treatment period through Week 52 (Period 2). After the open-label treatment period, all subjects were followed for an additional 8 weeks (56 days) without study drug treatment. For adolescent subjects, the dose of avacopan or placebo on day 1 of the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period was calculated based on body weight at screening. Dose could be adjusted based on avacopan plasma exposures (AUC0-6hr) on day 1. Starting on day 183 (open-label avacopan treatment period), adolescent subjects dose was reset based on their body weight determined on that day.

## Sample size

Planned enrollment in the study was approximately 88 subjects total with 44 subjects in each arm of the study (ie, avacopan, placebo) and 22 subjects within each C5b-9 strata (ie, elevated and normal) of each arm. Two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) were randomized to placebo during the double-blind treatment period.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Randomization was performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system and minimization algorithm, using the stratification factors. In order to protect blinding, the randomization schedule was not accessible to study personnel who had contact with study centers or who were involved in data management and analysis.

Figure 2: Randomization

<!-- image -->

Avacopan and placebo capsules were identical in appearance as were the bottles containing investigational product. Blinding of the study was also achieved by limited access to the randomization code, unblinded avacopan plasma concentration results were not shared with the study site personnel or study staff who have direct contact with study sites during the study. Data that could potentially be unblinding were not made available unless required for safety monitoring. Investigators, however, were provided with safety laboratory data reports, flagging abnormally high and low values in order to make informed decisions regarding patient care. An individual subject's treatment assignment was only unblinded in order to provide appropriate treatment or management of the subject in the case of an adverse event. The study monitor and sponsor were to be notified as soon as possible in all events of unblinding before study completion.

## Statistical Methods

Please refer to table under heading 'Objectives, Endpoints and Statistical methods'.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 57 subjects (28 avacopan, 29 placebo) were enrolled and randomized into the study. Twenty-six (92.9 % ) and 28 (96.6 % ) subjects, respectively, completed investigational product in the double-blind treatment period. At the time of the primary analysis, 4 subjects were still ongoing in the double-blind treatment period. These 4 subjects were excluded from the primary analyses of efficacy but were included in the final analysis tables. Three subjects (2 avacopan, 1 placebo) discontinued investigational product and the study during the double-blind period; reasons for investigational product withdrawal were sponsor decision and 'other' (1 avacopan subject each) and adverse event (1 placebo subject). The remaining 54 (94.7 % ) subjects (26 avacopan, 28 placebo) entered the avacopan treatment period. Forty-nine (86.0 % ) subjects completed the avacopan and follow-up treatment period; 47 (82.5 % ) subjects completed investigational product.

One adolescent subject showed improvement (ie, decrease of 3.0) in the C3G Histological Index of disease activity from baseline to week 26; there was no change from baseline to week 26 for the second adolescent subject.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Because the primary study endpoint was not met, the results from analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints should be considered exploratory according to the MAH.

Table 6: Percent Change from Baseline to Week 26 in UPCR In Subjects with Abnormal UPCR at Baseline - Subjects with Elevated C5b-9 in the ITT Population (Primary Analysis)

|                  | Placebo N = 20   | Avacopan 30 mg N = 18   |

| LS Mean (95% CI) | -14 (-34 to 12)  | -16 (-36 to 12)         |
| p-value          | 0.9284           |                         |

Among the 2 adolescent subjects, 1 had large decreases (ie, improvement) in percent change in UPCR from both baseline to week 26 (-78.3 % ) and baseline to week 52 (-86.0 % ) while the second adolescent subject had large increases at both time points (66 % and 90 % , respectively).

Both adolescent subjects entered the study with normal eGFR values (142 and 105 mL/min/1.73m 2 , respectively) and values remained in the normal range for both subjects at week 26 (152 and 118 mL/min/1.73m 2  , respectively) following 26 weeks of placebo and at week 52 (167 and 89 mL/min/1.73m 2  , respectively) following 26 weeks of avacopan.

## Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Adolescent Subjects

The types and severity of adverse events reported by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those observed in the entire safety population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One adolescent subject experienced nonserious, grade 1 adverse events of nausea, nasopharyngitis, and increased weight; none of these events were considered related to investigational product by the investigator. The second adolescent subject experienced nonserious, grade 1 adverse events of pyrexia (3 events), hyperkalaemia, cough, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, and asthenia. This subject also experienced serious adverse events of bronchitis (grade 1) from day 141 to day 145 and pneumonia (grade 2) from day 175 to day 184. The nonserious events of pyrexia and cough, and the serious adverse events of pneumonia and bronchitis in this subject were considered possibly related to investigational product by the investigator. All adverse events in both adolescent subjects, except for the nonserious event of increased weight which was reported as ongoing, resolved; both subjects completed investigational product and the study.

For chemistry parameters, 1 adolescent subject had transient grade 1 elevations in ALT (week 48) and creatine kinase (week 57) that returned to normal by the next visit; AST and ALP values in the subject remained normal throughout the study. The second adolescent subject had grade 1 increases in ALP and bilirubin at baseline; ALP values remained elevated throughout the study while bilirubin values were normal at all postbaseline time points. AST and ALT in the subject were normal throughout the study. This subject also reported grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 elevations in potassium at several time points throughout the study; 1 of the grade 3 elevations corresponded temporally with an adverse event of hyperkalaemia in the subject. Transient grade 1 elevations in creatine kinase at weeks 32, 54 and 57 were also noted in this subject.

For haematology parameters, 1 adolescent subject had transient grade 1 decreases in haemoglobin reported intermittently at 7 study visits; in each case, values returned to normal within 1 to 3 study visits. The second adolescent subject had grade 1 and grade 2 decreases in haemoglobin at every study time point (including baseline) and a transient grade 1 decreases in leukocytes at a single time point (week 28).

For urinalysis, 1 adolescent subject had grade 3 positive protein results at screening that remained elevated and fluctuated between grades 1 and 4 at every study visit. The 2nd adolescent subject had grade 2 positive protein urine results at baseline that remained elevated and fluctuated between grade 2 and grade 3 at every study visit. Urine chemistry results for both adolescent subjects also returned grade 1 to grade 3 elevations in protein at each study visit, including baseline. No notable changes from baseline in vital signs, weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were observed during the study in the overall safety population. One adolescent subject had gradual increases in weight and BMI of 12.5 kg (77.5 kg at baseline to 90.0 kg at week 60) and 3.530 kg/m2 (26.2 kg/m2 at baseline to 29.7 kg/m2 at week 60), respectively, over the course of the study (week 60) accompanied by a 2 cm increase in height over the same time period. The weight gain for this subject was reported as an adverse event. The other adolescent subject also had gradual increases in height (8 cm) and weight (4.3 kg) over the same time period, but a slight decrease in BMI (-0.183 kg/m2). ECG results for both adolescent subjects enrolled in the study were normal or considered nonsignificant by the investigator.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for paediatric studies, the MAH submitted the final study report of 'A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE)' which is not part of any Paediatric Investigation Plan. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was not met and the MAH does not plan to submit the results as a subject of a Variation to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Tavneos. This is agreed.

Only two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) participated in the study, both of whom were randomized to receive placebo in the initial double-blind period. The types and severity of adverse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

events reported by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those observed in the entire safety population. The study does not significantly contribute to the safety and efficacy data of Tavneos considering only two adolescent patients participated in the study.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Subjects with biopsy- proven C3G with or without a renal transplant, were stratified by elevated or normal levels of C5b-9 and then randomized 1:1 to receive avacopan or placebo twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks in a double-blind manner followed by open-label avacopan for an additional 26 weeks. Only two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) participated in the study, both of whom were randomized to receive placebo in the initial double-blind period. The types and severity of adverse events reported by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those observed in the entire safety population.

The study does not significantly contribute to the safety and efficacy data of Tavneos considering only two adolescent patients participated in the study.

The CHMP consider the application approvable. No regulatory actions are warranted.

The benefit risk ratio for the approved indication remains unchanged.
