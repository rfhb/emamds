## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Clinical aspects

ViraferonPeg/PegIntron is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection in combination with ribavirin. This combination is also indicated in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy.

- In the PEG2a arm, the dose was to be decreased to 600 mg regardless of initial dose.

The  approved  dose  of  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (PEG2b)  is  1.5 μ g/kg.  To  date  the  efficacy  of  the 1.0 μ g/kg dose and the 1.5 μ g/kg dose in combination with ribavirin has not been compared. The study 'IDEAL' (P03471) was therefore designed, in accordance with a post-approval commitment to the FDA, to compare the safety and efficacy of the two PEG2b dosing regimens. IDEAL also included the use of an active comparator, peginterferon alfa-2a (PEG2a) 180 µg/week plus weight-based ribavirin to  allow  for  the  evaluation  of  comparative  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin (PEG2b/R) and PEG2a/R treatment regimens. The  IDEAL  study  (P03471)  supports  a  therapeutic  extension  of  indication  to  include  treatment  of patients with compensated cirrhosis. On the basis of the IDEAL study results the MAH proposes to maintain the approved dose of peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG2b) as 1.5 μ g/kg. A change in the scheme for dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b in case of adverse effects and a change in the weight-based dosing algorithm for Rebetol are also proposed. The MAH also proposed an increase in the dose of Rebetol in the 81-85 kg weight category across all genotypes. 1.2 Scientific Overview and discussion Study design IDEAL was a randomised, parallel-group multicentre trial conducted in the USA, in treatment-naive genotype 1 patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  C.  Patients  were  randomised  to  three  different  treatment arms: · Peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μ g g/kg/week plus ribavirin (PEG2b 1.5/R). · Peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 μ g/kg/week plus  ribavirin (PEG2b 1.0/R) · Peginterferon alfa-2a 180 μ g/week plus ribavirin (PEG2a/R). In all arms, the pegylated interferon was combined with weight-based ribavirin. The dosing algorithm for ribavirin, however, was different between arms, reflecting the different posologies for ribavirin cotreatment in the ViraferonPeg and Pegasys SPCs: · In the PEG2b arms, ribavirin was dosed at 800 mg/day when body weight (BW) was 40-65kg, 1000 mg/day if BW &gt;65-85, 1200 mg/day if BW &gt;85-105 and 1400 mg/day if BW &gt;105kg. · In the PEG2a arm, patients with BW &lt; 75 kg received 1000 mg/day and those with BW &gt;75 kg received 1200 mg. The predefined algorithms for ribavirin dose modification in case of anaemia differed between arms: · In  the  PEG2b  arm,  the  ribavirin  dose  was  to  be  decreased  stepwise  by  200  mg  (400  mg  if initial dose 1400 mg), and again by 200 mg if necessary. edicinal product no longer authorise

Treatment duration was planned to 48 weeks, and stopping rules were applied in case of detectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks, or detectable and less than &gt;2 log10 decline of HCV-RNA at week 12.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

The  comparison  between  PEG2b  doses  was  double-blinded,  whereas  the  assignment  to  PEG2a  or PEG2b was open-label.

## Endpoints

- The primary endpoint variable was SVR (sustained virological response = undetectable HCVRNA 24 weeks post treatment completion).
- Comparison of proportions with SVR of arm 1 vs arm 2, and arm 1 vs arm 3 were defined as co-primary endpoints.

· Patients were stratified as to race (black vs non-black) and baseline HCV-RNA ( ≤ 600 000 vs &gt;600 000 IU/mL). Differential response in these strata were predefined secondary endpoints. Power considerations The  comparison  between  the  two  PEG2b  was  designed  to  have  an  80%  power  to  detect  a  6.5% difference in response rate, given a one-sided test, on the assumption of a greater efficacy of the higher dose, for an alpha of 0.025. The comparison between PEG2b1.5/R and PEG2a/R had 80% power to detect a 7% difference in response rate, at a two-sided alpha of 0.025. Results Patient disposition A total of 3070 subjects (1019 in the PEG2b 1.5/R arm, 1016 in the PEG2b 1.0/R arm, and 1035 in the PEG2a/R arm) were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug. Baseline characteristics The study population  consisted  of  mostly  male  (60%),  Caucasian  subjects,  over  40  years  old,  with 82% having a high viral load (&gt;600,000 IU/mL).  Most subjects had METAVIR F0/1/2 scores, and 11% of each arm had bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis. 1.3 Clinical Efficacy Primary endpoint The  study  demonstrated  that  each  of  the  three  treatment  regimens  results  in  similar  SVR  rates (Table  1)  that  did  not  differ  significantly.  The  response  rates  for  the  PEG2b  1.5/R  and  the PEG2b 1.0/R arms were 39.8 and 38%, respectively. The point estimate for  the  difference  was  1.8 with a 95% CI of -2.3 - +6.0. Table 1: Sustained Virologic Response rates in IDEAL comparator groups Protocol No. P03471 CI = confidence interval; PEG2b 1.5/R = peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μ g/kg/wk plus ribavirin; PEG2b 1.0/R = peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 μ g/kg/wk plus ribavirin; PEG2a/R = peginterferon alfa-2a 180 μ g/wk plus ribavirin; SVR = sustained virologic response. a: The p values and odds ratios are based on a logistic regression model that includes treatment and baseline stratification factors:  viral load ( ≤ 600,000 IU/mL vs &gt;600,000 IU/mL, measured by the SP laboratory) and race (Black vs non-Black). edicinal product no longer authorise

- b: The  primary  efficacy  analysis  utilizing  only  the  available  FW 24  data  (ie,  no  carry-forward  of  FW 12  data  for  missing  FW 24  data), resulted in similar trends in SVR rates: 36.1% (368/1019) in PEG2b 1.5/R vs 35.9% (365/1016) in PEG2b 1.0/R vs 38.5% (398/1035) in PEG2a/R, with nonsignificant P-values.

The PEG2b 1.5/R arm showed a higher proportion of SVR among black patients, compared with the PEG2b 1.0/R arm (23 vs 16.6%). This difference was discernable regardless of baseline HCV-RNA. In the subgroup with high baseline viral load (&gt; 600 000 IU/mL), the probability of SVR was roughly

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

similar  (35.3  vs  33.4%;  difference  1.9%;  95%  CI  -3.1  -  +6%).  Among  non-black  patients,  the probability of SVR in patients with high baseline viral load was similar between arms (38.8 vs 38.6%).

In subjects with cirrhosis (METAVIR F4), SVR rates for PEG2b 1.5/R was strikingly lower than for PEG2b 1.0/R (9.8 vs 30%).

Predictability of Response

Ribavirin dose and probability of SVR Table 3 shows SVR rates by assigned ribavirin dose. The large difference in SVR rates between the PEG2b arms and the PEG2a arm in the 80-85 kg stratum, where the formers received 1000 mg/day and the latter 1200 mg/day, is notable. Table 3  Sustained Virologic Response Rates by Assigned Ribavirin Dose Protocol No. P03471 Bold = higher dose of ribavirin in PEG2a arm. Italics = higher dose of ribavirin in PEG2b arms. Normal text = equivalent ribavirin dosing in PEG2b and PEG2a arms.

As shown in previous studies with interferon and ribavirin, early negativity is an important predictor for achieving a SVR. Subjects who achieve HCV negativity by TW 4 (rapid virologic response) have a high  probability  of  being  sustained  responders  (high  PPV).  As  shown  in  Table  5,  subjects  with  an undetectable HCV-RNA level at TW 4 who were treated with PEG2b 1.5 μ g/kg/wk (92.2%) had the highest response, followed by subjects treated with PEG2b 1.0 μ g/kg/wk (87.3%) or PEG2a (79.7%).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Consistent with the higher relapse rate observed with PEG2a/R, the PPV was lower in the PEG2a/R arm than in the PEG2b/R arms.

Among  those  subjects  who  had  detectable  HCV-RNA  at  TW  12  and  met  the  criteria  of ≥ 2-log decrease,  reassessment  at  TW  24  allowed  for  good  predictability  in  the  two  PEG2b  groups (44.6%/48.7%). Predictability for the PEG2b/R arms was better than for the PEG2a/R arm.

## Discussion Efficacy

Table 5:   Positive Predictive Values at TW 4 and TW 12 Protocol No. P03471 CI = confidence interval; FW = Follow-up Week; N/A = not available; PPV = positive predictive value; PEG2b 1.5/R = peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 µg/kg/wk plus ribavirin; PEG2b 1.0/R = peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 µg/kg/wk plus ribavirin; PEG2a/R = peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg/wk plus ribavirin; TW = Treatment Week. Note: TW 4 and TW 12 HCV-RNA results are independent of one another. a:   Sensitivity Analysis Week 4 PPV : Subjects with missing data at FW 24 were included in the analysis if TW 4 and TW 24 were undetectable:  PPVs at TW 4 are 94%, 91%, and 89% for PEG2b 1.5/R, PEG2b 1.0/R, PEG2a/R, respectively. b:   Sensitivity Analysis Week 12 PPV : Subjects with missing data at FW 24 were included in the analysis if TW 12 and TW 48 were undetectable:  PPVs at TW 12 are 82%, 84%, and 76% for PEG2b 1.5/R, PEG2b 1.0/R, PEG2a/R. The negative predictive value (NPV) is defined as the probability of not achieving SVR given that a subject did not achieve undetectable HCV-RNA at a specific time point. The decrease in HCV-RNA levels at TW 4 is highly sensitive and specific in identifying those subjects who are unlikely to achieve SVR. In this study, a failure to achieve a 1-log decrease in HCV-RNA level at TW 4 was associated with a 95% to 97% probability that the subject would fail to respond to treatment (Table 6). Subjects with greater decreases in viral load had a better chance of achieving SVR.

The  presently  approved  dose  of  PEG2b  is  1.5 μ g/kg.  The  IDEAL  study  tested  the  superiority hypothesis that a higher end of treatment rate seen in monotherapy phase 3 trials for the 1.5 µg/kg dose as compared to the 1.0 μ g/kg would translate into a higher rate of the clinically relevant SVR for the 1.5 µg/kg compared to 1.0 µg/kg, when combined with ribavirin. The IDEAL study did not deliver

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

evidence in support of this hypothesis. The overall SVR rates for PEG2b 1.5 and 1.0 μ g/kg/week were similar (40% and 38%, respectively).

Regarding  the  extension  to  include  patients  with  compensated  cirrhosis,  11  %  of  patients  in  the IDEAL  study  had  bridging  fibrosis/cirrhosis,  approximately  35  %  had  a  normal  baseline  ALT.  It should be noted that the IDEAL study was not designed to evaluate treatment of subjects with normal ALT level. However the results according to baseline ALT appeared to be comparable between the three  treatment  arms  with  somewhat  higher  SVR  rates  for  patients  with  elevated  ALT  at  baseline. Therefore the extension of indication is considered approvable.  Overall the addition of patients with cirrhosis is sufficiently substantiated by the IDEAL study.

Subgroups of patients with HCV known to have a lower likelihood of successful treatment outcome include those with genotype 1, high baseline HCV-RNA, black race and/or cirrhosis. In patients with baseline HCV-RNA &gt;600 000 there was however  no significant difference in the SVR rate between doses in the IDEAL study, and point estimates are roughly similar (35.3 vs 33.4%; difference 1.9%; 95%  CI  -3.1  -  +6%).  This  equivalence  of  effect  is  supported  by  data  from  the  dose-ranging monotherapy study [1], where the SVR rates for PEG2b 1.5 and PEG2b 1.0 were similar regardless of baseline HCV-RNA. In black patients there was a non-significant trend towards a higher SVR rate in patients treated with PEG2b  1.5/R  compared  to  PEG2b  1.0/R  (23.0  vs  16.6%).  These  results  imply  that  the  exposureresponse relation of peginterferons may be different in this population. The fact that similar rates of dose modifications and discontinuations due to neutropenia are seen regardless of race, despite lower baseline neutrophil counts in black, may corroborate this implication. A number of studies have established that African-Americans (AA) are less responsive to interferon therapy than Caucasians and that higher initial doses of interferon in difficult to treat patients have limited effect in increasing SVR. This suggests that increasing interferon doses for African-Americans will have led to only a small improvement in SVR, especially in contrast to using a protease inhibitor as  a  third  therapeutic  agent.  As  such  no  change  in  the  posology  for  black  patients  has  been recommended. Importantly,  in  patients  with  cirrhosis  (METAVIR  F4;  n  =  61  and  70),  there  was  a  striking  and statistically significant difference in SVR rates, to the advantage of the lower PEG2b 1.0/R arm on the PEG2b  1.5/R  arm  (30.0  vs.  9.8%;  difference  20.2%,  95%  CI  7-33%).  In  the  broader  category  of patients  with  fibrosis  or  cirrhosis  (F3/F4;  n  =  111  and  107),  point  estimates  were  also  clearly,  and almost statistically significantly, in favour of the lower dose (29.9 vs. 20.7%; difference 9.2%; 95% CI 20.7 - -2.3). The CHMP considered whether a lower starting dose could be considered for cirrhotic patients who may  have  lower  haematological  reserve  and  could  potentially  tolerate  higher  total  regimen  when receiving a lower PEG2b dose. However the CHMP agreed that the IDEAL study is not robust enough to demonstrate this taking into account that the conclusion are based on a subgroup analysis from a failing global analysis and this subgroup represents around 7% of the whole population of the study. There are also critical  imbalances  in  favour  of  the  PEG2b  lower  dose,  including  factors  potentially influencing  the  treatment  response  (i.e.  VL&gt;600K,  black).  An  unexpected  sharp  decrease  in  the response rate between F3 and F4 was also noted in the PEG2b 1.5/R (from 34% to 9.8%). Furthermore the difference between both treatment arms in favour of the PEG2b 1.0 µg/kg dose is already observed at week 2 suggests a sampling bias more than a true difference due to a differential tolerance. Finally the higher rate of EPO in the PEG2b 1.0 µg/kg allowing a higher dose ribavirin might in part explain the better response rate in the PEG2b 1.0 µg/kg arm. edicinal product no longer authorise

As such the CHMP agreed that the higher dose (1. 5 µg/kg) should be used for patients with cirrhosis.

Taking  into  account  the  higher  response  rates  with  higher  doses  of  ribavirin  per  body  weight  the CHMP accepted the proposed change in ribavirin dose from 1000 mg to 1200 mg (or 14-15 mg/kg) in

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

patients with a body weight of 81-85 kg and Genotype 1. There were concerns that the higher ribavirin dose might have an impact on adherence and thus SVR rates. However data provided by the MAH did not show a falling adherence rate within the range of mg/kg in question for the proposed change in posology.

The  MAH also  proposed  an  increased  ribavirin  dose  from  1000  to  1200  mg  in  Genotype  2  and  3 patients in the 81-85 kg stratum, although IDEAL exclusively studied patients with Genotype 1. The CHMP had concerns that putative gain in efficacy with the increased dose is at best marginal in these genotypes, and would mainly cause an increased rate of anaemia. Taking this into account the CHMP considered  that  the  posology  for  ribavirin  when  treating  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  might  be harmonised with the flat dosing of ribavirin that is used when co-treating with peginterferon alfa-2a. The  only  randomised  comparison  between  a  flat  dose  of  800  mg  and  a  weight  based  regimen (800-1400 mg/day) for PEG2b 1.5 μ g/kg  is  the  WIN-R  [2]  study,  in  which  there  was  no  genotype restriction. In a subgroup of 1500 patients with Genotype 2/3, point estimates for SVR in the weightbased and flat dose arms were 61.8% and 59.5% respectively, a non significant difference. Of note, the WIN-R study had a rather high rate of missing data, as reflected by the relatively low point estimates. The 800 mg flat dose posology for ribavirin in Genotype 2/3 is mainly based on a phase III clinical trial  published  by  Hadziyannis  et  al  [3].  In  this  study,  including  over  1000  patients  of  whom approximately 500 patients had Genotype 2/3, an 800 mg flat dose of ribavirin was compared to a higher, weight-based ribavirin dose regimen (1000/1200 mg below/above 75 kg), both in combination with PEG2a. The study, which had a factorial design, also compared 24 versus 48 weeks of therapy. There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  efficacy  in  patients  with  Genotype  2/3  given  the  higher, weight-based dose, point estimates for SVR rates being very similar at around 80%. Data from this study also show a higher rate of serious adverse events and anaemia with the higher, weight-based dose. Overall  the  available  randomised  evidence  with  PEG2a  or  PEG2b  fail  to  support  any  clinically significant  efficacy  advantage  of  a  higher  dose  of  ribavirin.  Available  observational  evidence including suboptimal interferon regimens such as IntronA or peginterferon alfa-2b  dosed at 0.5 µg/kg imply that there may be a lower response rate in very heavy individuals (&gt;110 kg), where effects of dose  and  baseline  factors  could  hardly  confidently  be  separated  by  multiple  regression  approaches. Importantly the ribavirin exposure response relationship when co-treating with standard interferon is not relevant to the question at hand. With regards to safety, the two studies comparing flat dose and weight based ribavirin treatment have, as is expected, shown a greater degree of anemia in patients treated  with  the  higher  dosed  weight  based  ribavirin  algorithms.  Taking  into  account  the  lack  of supportive  evidence  for  weight  based  ribavirin  dosing  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  a rational for the differing dosing recommendations between the different peginterferons. The MAH provided a putative rational as to why data from studies with PEG2a in Genotype 2/3 might not be applicable to PEG2b. Importantly the size and position of the PEG molecule used for PEG2b and  PEG2a  differ  significantly  in  their  respective  physical-chemical  characteristics.  Of  note  it  also results in loss of in vitro biological activity. The antiviral activity of PEG2b is approximately 28% of the interferon alfa-2b core protein while the antiviral activity of PEG2a ranges between 1% to 7% of the antiviral activity of the interferon alfa-2a core protein. It has also been demonstrated that the size and position of the PEG moiety on the interferon alpha molecule markedly affects its specific activity, presumably by stearic hindrance imposed upon the peptide by the addition of a larger PEG molecule. Silva  et  al [ 4 ] compared  pharmacokinetics  and  assessed  mRNA  expression  of  selected  interferoninduced RNA gene transcripts for the two pegylated interferons (PEG2b and PEG2a).  In this trial (COMPARE), 26 Genotype 1 patients received PEG2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) or PEG2a (180 µg/week) monotherapy for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks with the addition ofribavirin (~13 mg/kg/day). edicinal product no longer authorise

Overall  there  is  a  much  greater  protein  exposure  with  the  larger  PEG2a  at  the  recommended  dose which,  in  part,  reflects  the  lower  specific  activity  of  the  molecule  thus  requiring  more  product  to achieve  optimal  antiviral  activity.  Despite  the  greater  exposure  with  PEG2a,  there  was  consistently greater  up-regulation  of  RNA  transcripts  in  patients  treated  with  PEG2b  compared  with  patients

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

treated with PEG2a for the majority of the interferon-response genes investigated. Similarly, with a greater up-regulation in interferon response genes, PEG2b demonstrated significantly greater antiviral activity  vs.  PEG2a  at  week  one,  with  greater  maximum  antiviral  activity  (P&lt;0.001)  and  greater cumulative antiviral activity (P=0.017); the slope of the viral load reduction for PEG2b was greater over the eight-week study duration (P&lt;0.002).  In addition, 72% percent of patients in the PEG2b arm achieved at least a 2.0 log10 reduction in viral load as compared to 44% of patients in the PEG2a arm during the study (p=0.09).  The mean maximum and time-weighted decreases in log10 viral load were significantly  greater  with  PEG2b than PEG2a on Week 1 and Week 4. These results show that the viral kinetics are very different for both of these interferons with apparent periods of viral replication with  PEG2b  vs.  PEG2a.  This  may  also  affect  the  mechanism  by  which  the  pegylated  interferons interact with ribavirin.  Thus, the two molecules, while each exerting interferon antiviral activity, do so in a very different manner, and it cannot be assumed that the ribavirin interaction at a given dose will be the same.

The CHMP considered that it is questionable whether these differences in PK/PD really imply that the need of ribavirin dosing is actually higher for PEG2b in Genotype 2/3, given that the total viral load decline over time in this cited study was greater with PEG2b than with PEG2a and that ribavirin has virtually no direct effect on HCV viral load [ 5 ] .  Overall however the CHMP acknowledged that the MAH has provided an argument that data generated with PEG2a might not be applicable to PEG2b, due to the clear differences in the PK/PD relation between these two drugs. As such the CHMP agreed to  maintain  weight  base  dosing  for  ribavirin  in  combination  with  PEG2b  and  therefore  to  the  dose increase of ribavirin in Genotype 2 and 3 patients weighing 81-85 kg. Regarding the predictive value of response at treatment week 4 and 12 and their usefulness in clinical practice for the management of HCV-infected patients, this has been increasingly highlighted in the recent years. Some data suggest that rapid and early virological response to treatment (at treatment week 4 (TW4) and 12 (TW12)) rather than genotype might be better factor to guide optimal treatment duration  (24  weeks,  48  weeks  or  longer  treatment  duration).  In  the  IDEAL  study  a  null  response (defined  as  less  than  1  log  decline  in  HCV  RNA  from  baseline)  at  TW4  was  found  to  be  a  strong predictor of lack of response and is a relevant early stopping rule. Furthermore among those subjects who had detectable HCV-RNA at TW12 and met the criteria of ≥ 2-log decrease, reassessment at TW 24  allowed  for  good  predictability  in  the  two  PEG2b  groups  (44.6%/48.7%).    Rebetol  and ViraferonPeg SPC have been revised in order to include these observations on predictiveness, in order to better guide physicians in their clinical decision making. 1.4 Clinical Safety Patient Exposure 3070 patients received at least one dose of study medication. Approximately half of the subjects (54% and 49%) received 48 weeks of PEG2b 1.5/R and PEG2b 1.0/R treatment. 61% of the subjects in the PEG2a/R arm received 48 weeks of treatment. Adverse events The  incidence  of  treatment  related  AEs  were  similar  in  the  PEG2b  1.5  arm  compared  with  the PEG2b 1.0  arm.  AEs  in  which  the  difference  was ≥ 3%  in  incidence  between  the  PEG2b  1.5  and PEG2b 1.0 treatment arms are shown in Table 7. edicinal product no longer authorise

Dose modification

The higher rates of anaemia and neutropenia in the 1.5 µg/kg arm as compared to the 1.0 µg/kg arm is noted and expected. The study drug discontinuation rate was higher in the 1.5 µg/kg arm than in the 1.0 µg/kg arm (12.7 vs. 9.6%). The frequency of SAE was similar: 8.6% vs 9.3%. The incidence of treatment-related, treatment-emergent depression was 6% higher in the PEG2b 1.5 treatment arm compared with the PEG2b 1.0 treatment arm, although the more severe outcomes of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were similar among the three arms of the study. The incidences of psychiatric disorders were similar among the treatment arms (58% in the PEG2b 1.5 arm and 55% in the PEG2b 1.0 arm). Deaths Twelve subjects died during this study: 5 subjects in the PEG2b 1.5/R arm, 1 in the PEG2b 1.0/R arm, and 6 in the PEG2a/R arm.  One of these events, a completed suicide in the PEG2b 1.5/R was judged by the investigator as possibly related to the treatment. Discontinuation AEs led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  12.7%  of  subjects  in  the  PEG2b  1.5/R  arm,  9.6%  in  the PEG2b 1.0/R arm, and 13.0% in the PEG2a/R arm. The difference in discontinuation rates between PEG2b 1.5/R and PEG2b 1.0/R was statistically significant (3%; 95% CI 0.2-5.7%). The  proportion  of  subjects  (excluding  those  who  discontinued)  that  required  dose  modifications  of PEG2b where 25% in the PEG2b 1.5/R and 17% in the PEG2b 1.0/R. The percentages  of  patients reporting  typical  peginterferon  side  effects  were  higher  in  the  PEG2b 1.5/R  arm  compared  to  the PEG2b 1.0/R: Pyrexia/Chills 51 vs. 47%, Neutropenia/leukopenia 27 vs. 20%, depression 25 vs. 19%. edicinal product no longer authorise

## Proposed  change  in  the  scheme  of  dose  reduction  for  ViraferonPeg  and  Rebetol  in  case  of adverse effects.

The MAH proposed a new dose-reduction schedule for ViraferonPeg of 1.5 → 1.0 → 0.5 μ g/kg, in case of adverse events. Presently, the SPC for ViraferonPeg states that the ViraferonPeg dose be reduced to

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

one-half if WBC count falls below 1.5*10 9 /L, if neutrophils falls below 0.75*10 9 /L or if the platelet count falls below 50*10 9 /L (and that ViraferonPeg be discontinued if these levels fall below 1*10 9 /L, 0.5*10 9 /L and 25*10 9 /L, respectively). A large proportion of patients randomised to 1.5 μ g/kg, who had a one step dose reduction, did not require a second dose reduction, maintaining a high exposure. This  dose  reduction  schedule  appears  justified  as  the  1.5 μ g/kg  starting  dose  has  been  endorsed. However, the dose reduction scheme did not prevent a significantly higher number of discontinuations in  patients  randomised  to  the  higher  dose:  12.7%  of  subjects  discontinued  treatment  in  the  PEG2b 1.5/R arm, compared to 9.6% in the PEG2b 1.0/R arm, and 13.0% in the PEG2a/R arm. The difference in discontinuation rates between PEG2b 1.5/R and PEG2b 1.0/R was 3%; 95% CI 0.2-5.7%.

Table 8: Summary of dose modification steps due to adverse events The MAH also proposed a change to the algorithm for dose adjustment of Rebetol in case of anaemia to be modified in accordance with that used in the PEG2b 1.5/R and PEG2b 1.0/R arms of the IDEAL study. In the PEG2b arm, the ribavirin dose was decreased stepwise by 200 mg (400 mg if initial dose 1400 mg), and again 200 mg if necessary. This strategy was also used in the WIN-R study [ 2 ] .  The dose modification algorithm has been extensively evaluated, and is in line with available evidence that maintaining a high ribavirin exposure is important for the optimisation of the likelihood of SVR. Discussion Clinical Safety The  safety  profile  of  PEG2b  and  PEG2a  when  used  in  combination  with  ribavirin  in  this  study  is consistent with that in the respective current product information; no new or unexpected AEs were observed.  The  study  drug  discontinuation  rate  was  higher  in  the  PEG2b  1.5 μ g/kg  arm  than  in  the PEG2b 1.0 μ g/kg arm (12.7 vs. 9.6%). The frequency of SAE was similar: 8.6% vs 9.3%. There was however a higher rate of anemia and neutropenia in the 1.5 μ g/kg arm as compared to the 1.0 µg/kg arm which is as expected. The proportion of patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, as defined by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Data, was compared for the two ViraferonPeg doses (32%  in  the  PEG2b  1.5  arm  and  29.4%  in  the  PEG2b  1.0  arm).  From  a  clinical  perspective  the difference of 2.6% is not meaningful, although due to the large sample size of the study the difference is statistically significant. Study sites were notified in case of critical values of CES-D assessment and patients were to be assessed and managed clinically according to a pre specified plan at site. The CES-D evaluation was included in the IDEAL study to determine if a patient self-administered assessment  could  provide,  in  addition  to  physician  assessment,  an  indicator  of  development  of psychiatric  adverse  events.  The  CES-D  scores  during  the  study  did  not  predict  the  most  severe psychiatric outcomes and cannot therefore supersede a physician's clinical assessment. In an attempt to  determine  the  physician  utility  of  the  CES-D  and  the  potential  to  use  baseline  CES-D  scores  to predict the likelihood of a particular patient developing a psychiatric adverse event(s), further analyses are being performed by the MAH. edicinal product no longer authorise

The  new  dose-reduction  schedule  for  ViraferonPeg  of  1.5 → 1.0 → 0.5 μ g/kg,  and  the  stepwise  dose reduction of 200 mg (400 mg if initial dose 1400 mg), and again 200 mg of ribavirin if necessary in case of adverse events is accepted. This dose reduction schedule of ViraferonPeg appears justified also

taking  into  account  that    the  1.5 μ g/kg  starting  dose  has  been  endorsed    The  dose  modification algorithm  for  ribavirin  has  been  extensively  evaluated,  and  is  in  line  with  available  evidence  that maintaining a high ribavirin exposure is important for the optimisation of the likelihood of SVR.

## Risk management

The CHMP agreed that a EU - Risk management plan would not be required for the extension of indication in for the target population of patients with compensated cirrhosis. II. BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSION The  IDEAL  study  did  not  demonstrate  any  overall  difference  in  efficacy  between  the  doses investigated.  No  major  safety  disadvantage  of  the  higher  dose  has  emerged.  Furthermore  for  many Caucasians  the  higher  dose  is  likely  to  be  more  efficacious.  Therefore  1.5 μ g/kg  remains  the recommended dose in the overall population. Regarding  the  extension  to  include  patients  with  compensated  cirrhosis,  11  %  of  patients  in  the IDEAL  study  had  bridging  fibrosis/cirrhosis,  approximately  35  %  had  a  normal  baseline  ALT.  It should be noted that the IDEAL study was not designed to evaluate treatment of subjects with normal ALT level. However the results according to baseline ALT appeared to be comparable between the three  treatment  arms  with  somewhat  higher  SVR  rates  for  patients  with  elevated  ALT  at  baseline. Therefore the extension of indication is considered approvable. Overall the addition of patients with compensated cirrhosis is sufficiently substantiated by the IDEAL study. The CHMP considered whether a lower starting dose could be recommended for cirrhotic patients who may  have  lower  haematological  reserve  and  could  potentially  tolerate  higher  total  regimen  when receiving  a  lower  PEG2b  dose.  However  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  study  is  not  robust  enough  to demonstrate this and thus agreed to maintain the 1.5 μ g/kg posology in this subgroup. In black patients there was a non-significant trend towards a higher SVR rate in patients treated with PEG2b  1.5/R  compared  to  PEG2b  1.0/R.  A  number  of  studies  have  established  that  AfricanAmericans (AA) are less responsive to interferon therapy than Caucasians and that higher initial doses of  interferon  in  difficult  to  treat  patients  have  limited  effect  in  increasing  SVR.  This  suggests  that increasing interferon doses for African-Americans will have led to only a small improvement in SVR, especially in contrast to using a protease inhibitor as a third therapeutic agent. As such no change in the posology for black patients has been made. Concerning the weight based dosing of Rebetol, PK/PD data give a putative pharmacologic rationale for  why  data  from  studies  with  PEG2a  in  Genotype  2/3  might  not  be  applicable  to  PEG2b. Discounting the Hadziyannis study, the evidence base for a flat dose is considerably weakened. There is  clearly  more  experience  with  weight  based  regimens  when  co-treating  with  PEG2b,  though  the relative  merit  of  this  remains  undecided.  The  generalisation  of  the  suggested  dose  increase  is  not mandated by data, but there are no prohibitive safety concerns. From a practical point of view, two very  similar  posologies  for  Genotype  1  and  2/3  should  be  avoided.  Finally,  the  putative  benefit  of harmonised  ribavirin  dosing  between  peginterferons  in  Genotype  2/3  would  depend  on  this  being implemented  also  outside  EU.  As  this  presently  does  not  appear  feasible,  the  main  argument  for pursuing harmonised dosing falls. Therefore, the generalisation of the dose increase to all genotypes is recommended. edicinal product no longer authorise

Overall the risk benefit balance of peginterferon alfa-2b is considered positive taking into account the changes implemented to reflect the results of the IDEAL study.
