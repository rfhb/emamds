| II/0005/G | This was an application for a group of variations. C.I.1.a - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a Union referral procedure - The product is not covered by the defined scope of the procedure C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 22/06/2017 | 16/03/2018 | SmPC and PL | Changes introduced are based on clinical data from the monocomponents of this fixed dose combination. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC were updated with data from the trial 1245.25, which analysed the effect of the empagliflozin component of Glyxambi on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. The adverse drug reaction 'thirst' was added with a frequency of common based on post-marketing data from empagliflozin. Several minor changes to the SmPC were added to align with changes introduced for the SmPCs of Jardiance/Synjardy (empagliflozin) and Trajenta/Jentadueto (linagliptin). Section 4.4 was also updated to add a warning on the risk of lower limb amputations of SGLT2 inhibitors as follows: an increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing long-term clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot- care. |
