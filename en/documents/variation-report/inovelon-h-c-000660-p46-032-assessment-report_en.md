## 1. Introduction

On 11 th  of December 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Inovelon® 100 mg and 200 mg Film-coated Tablets, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Rufinamide is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant approved in EU and other countries globally as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in patients from 1  year  old.  Rufinamide  was  first  approved  via  the  Centralised  Procedure  on  16  January  2007 (International Birth Date) in the EU, for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years and older. It was approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan (PMDA) on Mar 25, 2013. Cumulatively, rufinamide 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg tablets have been approved for marketing in over 52 countries.

Rufinamide is marketed under the trade name Inovelon and is available as 100-, 200- and 400- mg tablets and 40 mg/ml oral suspension.

EISAI is hereby submitting the final Clinical Study Report for Study INO01T. Study INO01T was a specified prospective,  post-marketing,  multicentre,  observational  study  conducted  in  Japan  in  children  over  4 years old and adults with LGS. The planned sample size of the study was 300 patients (patients whose case report forms [CRFs] were obtained), including at least 150 patients aged 4 to less than 15 years of age and at least 100 patients aged ≥ 15 years. Patients included in the study were treated with Inovelon after a diagnosis of LGS.

The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrences of expected and unexpected adverse reactions and priority study items, as well as the long term efficacy and the factors that may affect safety or efficacy related to the long-term use of Inovelon Tablets in routine clinical practice in patients with LGS.

The submission of these final data is being made to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the obligation to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a paediatric population.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

## · INO01T

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## INO01T

## Description

This is a specified prospective post-marketing observational study conducted following approval (date of approval: March 25, 2013) of Inovelon 100 mg/200 mg Tablets. The study was conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the protocol submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (prepared on April 4, 2013).

Study INO01T was a specified prospective, post-marketing, multicentre, observational study conducted in Japan in children over 4 years old and adults with LGS.

This study was conducted to investigate the following matters related to the long-term use of Inovelon Tablets in routine clinical practice in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS):

- (1) Unexpected adverse reactions
- (2) Occurrences of adverse reactions
- (3) Long-term efficacy
- (4) Factors that may affect the safety or efficacy

(5)  Occurrences  of  status  epilepticus,  skin  disorders,  drug-induced  hypersensitivity  syndrome  and oculomucocutaneous  syndrome  (Stevens-Johnson  syndrome),  and  central  nervous  system  (CNS) adverse events (e.g., ataxia, somnolence, dizziness)

The planned sample size of the study was 300 patients (patients whose case report forms [CRFs] were obtained), including at least 150 patients aged 4 to less than 15 years of age and at least 100 patients aged ≥ 15 years. Patients included in the study were treated with Inovelon after a diagnosis of LGS.

The  study  and  enrolment  periods  were  from  the  initial  marketing  date  of  Inovelon  in  Japan  to  the completion time point of the regulatory authorities' (PMDA) evaluation of the appropriate conduct of the study. Patients were enrolled using the central registration system and were observed for 2 years at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from the initiation of Inovelon treatment. If the patient discontinued Inovelon or did not attend the study visits, the patient was discontinued from the study and the investigators recorded the date and reasons for study discontinuation, and assessments until 2 weeks after study discontinuation into the CRFs.

## CHMP comment:

This observational post marketing study wa s conducted in patients aged ≥4 y-o treated with Inovelon after a diagnosis of LGS . In the context of this PAM P46, CHMP focused only on paediatric and adolescent population (e.g. 294 /702 patients).

Screening and enrolment were done at Day 1 and Treatment period lasted 2 years. Visit during the treatment period has been done at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.

## Methods

## Study participants

All patients treated with Inovelon after receiving a diagnosis of LGS.

## Treatments

Children aged 4 years and older

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children weighing 15.0 to 30.0 kg: The recommended dosage is 200 mg/day of rufinamide administered orally in 2 divided doses after meals for the first 2 days, followed by dose titration in increments of 200 mg/day or less as frequently as every two days. The maintenance dosage is 1000 mg/day administered orally in 2 divided doses after meals. The dose may be adjusted appropriately according to symptoms, up to a maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg/day. Dose titration should be performed in increments of 200 mg/day or less at intervals of not less than 2 days.

Children  weighing  ≥30.1  kg :  Inovelon  should  be  administered  in  accordance  with  the  dosage  and administration for adults.

## Adults

The recommended dosage is 400 mg/day of rufinamide administered orally in 2 divided doses after meals for the first 2 days, followed by dose titration in increments of 400 mg/day or less as frequently as every two days. The maintenance dosage is 1800 mg/day for patients weighing 30.1 to 50.0 kg, 2400 mg/day for patients weighing 50.1 to 70.0 kg, and 3200 mg/day for patients weighing 70.1 kg or more. Each daily dose amount is to be administered orally in 2 divided doses after meals. The dose may be adjusted appropriately according to symptoms, within the range that would not exceed the maintenance dose. Dose titration should be performed in increments of 400 mg/day or less at intervals of not less than 2 days.

## CHMP comment:

Of note, it seems there is some differences between European SmPC and the Japanese one regarding dose administration.

For  children  weighing  15.0  to  30.0  kg ,  it  is  specified  in  the  European  SmPC  that  the  dose  ma y  be increased by 200 mg/day increments, as frequently as every third day , whereas it seems to be every two days in Japan. No recommendation seems to be made for children aged 4 years and older weighting less than 15 kg. However, the dosage seems the same as in Europe.

Moreover, no dose recommendations are made for patients also receiving valproate, as it is specified in the European SmPC.

No consideration will be raised concerning these observations as it seems non -relevant with the study assessed for this PAM.

## Objective(s)

The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrences of expected and unexpected adverse reactions and priority study items, as well as the long-term efficacy and the factors that may affect safety or efficacy related to the long-term use of Inovelon Tablets in routine clinical practice in patients with LGS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy evaluation criteria

The efficacy evaluation criteria included seizure frequency by seizure type and percent change from Baseline  (at  the  initiation  of  Inovelon  treatment)  in  seizure  frequency  and  overall  improvement,  as described in Section 1.2.8 of the INO01T Study Report.

## (1) Seizure frequency and percent change

The efficacy evaluation criteria included seizure frequency by seizure type and percent change from baseline (at the initiation of Inovelon treatment) in seizure frequency, which were calculated at treatment initiation and at each assessment time point (Week 12, Month 6, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2 [or at the time of treatment discontinuation and 2 weeks after treatment discontinuation in discontinued cases]).

## (2) Overall improvement

The  overall  improvement  was  rated  as  \"Markedly  improved,\"  \"Considerably  improved,\"  \"Slightly improved,\" \"Unchanged,\" \"Slightly worsened,\" \"Considerably worsened,\" \"Markedly worsened,\" or \"Not assessable\" at each assessment time point (Week 12, Month 6, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2 [or at the time of treatment discontinuation]), compared with patients' conditions at baseline at the initiation of Inovelon treatment. Patients whose conditions were assessed as 'Markedly improved,' 'Considerably improved,' or 'Slightly improved' were defined as responders, and the proportion of responders (efficacy rate) was included in the efficacy evaluation criteria.

## Safety evaluation criteria

Adverse events were defined as any undesirable or unintended diseases or their symptoms or signs, or abnormal changes in laboratory test values that occurred in patients treated with Inovelon, regardless of the causal relationship with Inovelon. Among adverse events, those in which a causal relationship with Inovelon could not be ruled out were defined as adverse reactions. However, existing epileptic seizures and these seizures-related events (e.g., abnormal EEG, CT, MRI, or other findings) were not handled as adverse events, while status epilepticus was handled as an adverse event.

## Sample size

The planned sample size of the study was 300 patients (patients whose case report forms [CRFs] were obtained), including at least 150 patients aged 4 to less than 15 years of age and at least 100 patients aged ≥ 15 years. Patients included in the study were treated with Inovelon after a diagnosis of LGS.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## NA

## Statistical Methods

## Safety

(1) The number and proportion of patients in whom adverse reactions occurred and the numbers and incidence rates of events reported as adverse reactions based on their types were calculated. In addition, the number and proportion of patients with serious adverse events and the numbers and incidence rates of these events based on their types were calculated. Similar analyses were performed for suiciderelated adverse events, and adverse events related to QT/QTc interval shortening or proarrhythmic effects.

(2)  To  investigate  for  factors  possibly  affecting  the  safety,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  adverse reactions were calculated based on patient backgrounds, treatment status, the numbers and types of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

coadministered oral AEDs, and presence/absence of co-administered drugs that inhibit carboxylesterases or co-administered drugs primarily metabolized by carboxylesterases, and the Fisher's exact test or χ 2 test was performed. Similar analyses were performed for suicide-related adverse events, and adverse events related to QT/QTc interval shortening or proarrhythmic effects.

(3)  The  number and proportion of patients in whom adverse events occurred and the numbers and incidence  rates  of  these  events  based  on  their  types  were  calculated.  In  addition,  the  number  and proportion of patients with serious adverse events and the numbers and incidence rates of these events based on their types were calculated.

(4)  Effects  on  the  growth  of  children  (body  height  and  body  weight).  Summary  statistics  of  body height/weight were calculated at each assessment time point.

(5) Occurrences of withdrawal symptoms. The occurrences of withdrawal symptoms and relationships with the administration status of Inovelon were investigated.

## Efficacy

(1) Seizure frequency and percent change. Summary statistics of seizure frequency and percent change were calculated at each assessment time point.

(2)  Overall  improvement.  Patients  in  whom  the  efficacy  was  assessed  as  \"Markedly  improved,\" \"Considerably improved,\" or \"Slightly improved\" based on the overall improvement rating (\"Markedly improved,\" \"Considerably improved,\" \"Slightly improved,\" \"Unchanged,\" \"Slightly worsened,\" \"Considerably worsened,\" \"Markedly worsened,\" or \"Not assessable\") were defined as effective cases. The efficacy rate (proportion of effective cases in the efficacy analysis set excluding \"Not assessable\" cases) at each assessment time point and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

(3)  To  investigate  for  factors  possibly  affecting  the  efficacy,  the  efficacy  rates  using  the  overall improvement rating were calculated based on patient backgrounds and treatment status, and the Fisher's exact test or χ 2 test was performed.

## Results

## Participant flow / Recruitment / Number analysed

Of the enrolled patients, 729 were patients whose CRFs were to be obtained (patients who had started to receive Inovelon at contracted sites prior to and including February 28, 2014). The disposition of these patients was 576 newly-treated LGS patients, 110 newly-treated non-LGS patients, and 43 patients on continued treatment.

Of the 729 patients whose CRFs were to be obtained, 707 patients' CRFs were obtained from 178 sites, excluding 9 patients who were transferred to another hospital and 13 patients whose CRFs were not obtained.  The  13  patients  whose  CRFs  were  not  obtained  were  \"patients  whose  CRFs  (1)  were unobtainable due to inconvenience on the part of medical institutions.\"

The disposition of the 707 patients whose CRFs were obtained was 560 newly-treated LGS patients, 106 newly-treated non-LGS patients, and 41 patients on continued treatment. Of the 560 newly-treated LGS patients, 11 were patients under 4 years of age, 227 were patients ≥4 to &lt;15 years of age, and 322 were patients ≥15 years of age. The planned target populations of \"at least 150 patients ≥4 to &lt;15 years of age and at least 100 patients ≥15 years of age\" were ensured. Of the 707 patients whose CRFs were obtained, 702 patients were included in the safety analysis, and 5 patients were excluded from the safety analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 702 patients included in the safety analysis, 558 were newly treated LGS patients (294 patients aged &lt;18 years at Baseline; hereafter referred to as paediatric and adolescent patients), 104 were newly treated non-LGS patients (80 paediatric and adolescent patients), and 40 (22 paediatric and adolescent patients)  were  patients  on  continued  treatment.  Of  the  702  patients  in  the  safety  analysis  set,  495 patients (250 paediatric and adolescent patients; all newly treated patients with LGS) were included in the efficacy analysis, and 207 patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis (106 patients treated with Inovelon off-label, 56  patients treated  with  Inovelon  outside  the  approved  dosage  and administration, 40 patients who continued Inovelon treatment from the post-marketing clinical study, and 23 patients who were unevaluable for efficacy evaluations, as described in the study report). Thus, 396 and 250 paediatric and adolescent patients were included in the safety and efficacy analysis sets, respectively.

## CHMP comment:

702 patients were included in the safety analysis: 558 were newly treated LGS patients, with 294 patients aged less than 18 years.

In this 702 patients, 495 were included, of which 250 newly treated LGS patients aged less than 18 years.

In total, 396 and 250 paediatric and adolescent patients were included in the safety and efficacy analysis sets, respectively .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

The  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  in  this  study  were  predominantly  male  (56.8%;  225/396). Regarding  the  'presence/absence  of  pregnancy,'  100.00%  of  the  305  female  patients  were  'not pregnant' at study initiation. Median age of these patients was 10.0 years (range: 1 to 17 years). Median duration  of  primary disease  was  6.14  years  (range:  0.0  to  17.3  years).  At  Baseline,  most  (77.8%; 308/396) paediatric and adolescent patients had comorbid diseases and none had congenital short QT syndrome; almost all (96.2%) patients had a form of intellectual disability.

Status epilepticus in the 28 days before patients entered the study was confirmed in 51 (12.9%) patients, 41 of whom where newly treated patients with LGS. In the week before participating in the study, most (60.1%) patients had seizures other than tonic and atonic, 36.9% of patients had tonic or atonic seizures, and 3.0% of patients had no seizures.

All  patients  received  at  least  1  AED,  with  the  most  common  one  being  sodium  valproate  (78.0%  of patients).  Most  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  received  3  or  more  concomitant  AEDs.  For  most baseline disease characteristics, there were no clinically meaningful differences among the newly treated patients with LGS, newly treated non-LGS patients, and patients on continued treatment in the paediatric and adolescent patients or between the paediatric and adult patients (Table ADD3.2.1.2).

## Efficacy results

All efficacy analyses were based on the efficacy analysis set. The efficacy analysis set included all newly treated patients with LGS in the study (N=495); of those, 250 were paediatric and adolescent patients. The main efficacy endpoints were evaluation of seizure frequency (by seizure type and percent change from Baseline; Table ADD3.3.2.3.2(2); Table 2 -67 to Table 2-77 in the INO01T Study Report) and overall improvement  (rated  as  markedly  improved,  considerably  improved,  slightly  improved,  unchanged, slightly worsened, considerably worsened, markedly worsened, or not assessable) at each assessment time point.

The efficacy rate based on the overall improvement (number of effective cases assessed as \"Markedly improved,\"  \"Considerably  improved,\"  or  \"Slightly  improved\"/total  number  of  cases  excluding  \"Not assessable\" cases) at the final assessment time point was 43.01% (83/193 patients) in the paediatric group; the efficacy rate was comparable with 48.03% (134/279 patients) in the non-paediatric group (Table 2).

## CHMP comment:

The efficacy rate at the final assessment time point (2 years of treatment) was 42% (100/243 patients) in the less than 18 years group. This rate is comparable to the more than 15 years group for which the overall improvement was 48% (134/279 patients). The efficacy rate for the adult population only (more than 18 years) is not av ailable.

In the efficacy analysis set, the proportions of paediatric and adolescent patients achieving a ≥ 50% decrease in seizure frequency at the final assessment time point were:

- [ ]  Partial seizures: 35.0% (14/40; 33.8% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Absence seizures: 50.0% (1/2; 42.9% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Atypical absence seizures: 60.5% (23/38; 50.0% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Myoclonic seizures: 38.9% (14/36; 38.1% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Clonic seizures: 62.5% (5/8; 47.1% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Tonic seizures: 39.1% (54/138; 37.7% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Tonic- clonic seizures: 37.9% (11/29; 39.4% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Atonic seizures: 63.4% (26/41; 56.8% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Unclassified epileptic seizures: 40.0% (4/10; 43.5% for all -ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Tonic/atonic seizures (sum of tonic seizures and atonic seizures): 44.2% (65/147; 41.0% for all- ages patients in the study)

- [ ]  Unspecified seizures: 100.0% (3/3)

- [ ] 

- [ ] All types of seizures: 41.8%

## CHMP comment:

The proportions of less than 18 years patients achieving a ≥50% decrease in all types of seizure frequency at the final assessment time point (2 years of treatment) were 42% (59/141), which is comparable to the overall population of this study (40%). Moreover, 27% of less than 18 years patients have achieved a ≥75% decrease in all types of seizure frequency at the final assessment time point.

Direct comparisons of preapproval versus post-marketing data are difficult to make due to a difference in the treatment period. However, the percent change in pre-approval data (treatment period: 2-week dose escalation period and 10-week dose maintenance period) was -24.2%, and the percent change at Month 6 of treatment in the postmarketing study was -33.3%, showing no significant difference between pre-approval and post-marketing data.

## CHMP comment:

The MAH has compared the results of this study with the pre-approval data. On the overall population of this study, no significant difference was observed in the percent change in tonic/atonic seizure frequency.

## Safety results

The safety analysis set included 702 patients; of those, 396 patients were below 18 years of age at Baseline (294 newly treated patients with LGS, 80 newly treated non-LGS patients, and 22 patients on continued treatment).

All safety analyses were based on the safety analysis set.

The main safety endpoints were the incidence and seriousness of AEs (defined as any undesirable or unintended diseases or their symptoms or signs, or abnormal changes in laboratory test values that occurred in patients treated with Inovelon, regardless of the causal relationship with Inovelon) and of adverse reactions (defined as AEs where a causal relationship with Inovelon could not be ruled out), including priority study items (status epilepticus events, skin-related events, and CNS events). Other safety endpoints included occurrences of Inovelon withdrawal symptoms, effect of Inovelon on growth of children, use in children under 4 years of age or weighing less than 15.0 kgs, occurrences of suicidal behaviour  or  suicidal  ideation,  interactions  with  sodium  valproate,  use  in  patients  with  hepatic impairment,  use  in  pregnant  women  or  in  patients  who  may  be  pregnant,  drug-drug  interactions mediated by carboxylesterases.

## Extent of Exposure

For the overall paediatric and adolescent patient population (396 patients), the mean daily dose was 842.15 mg/day, the mean maximum daily dose was 1091.7 mg/day (both associated to lower body weight of these patients compared with the adult patients) and the mean treatment duration was 485.9 days (481.6 days for all-ages patients in the study).

For the newly treated paediatric and adolescent patients with LGS (294 patients), the mean daily dose was 860.98 mg/day, the mean maximum daily dose was 1118.2 mg/day, and the mean treatment duration was 494.6 days (483.9 days for newly treated all-ages patients)

## Adherence to Treatment

Adherence to Inovelon treatment in paediatric and adolescent patients by the Kaplan-Meier method is shown in

Figure 2 below. The treatment adherence rate at Year 2 was 52.5% (51.9% in all-ages patients).

## CHMP comment:

The treatment adherence rate at Year 2 was 52.5% in pediatric patients treated with rufinamide, compared to 53.1% in patients newly treated with rufinamide. Treatment adherence reached similar proportions according to these numbers. Moreover, the Kaplan -Meier curve for adherence to Inovelon treatment shows a very similar profile for treatment adherence in both groups.

## Adverse Reactions and Adverse Events

In the safety analysis set, 180 paediatric and adolescent patients had adverse reactions; the incidence of adverse reactions was 45.5% (48.6% for all-ages patients in the study).

## Adverse Reactions and Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation or Interruption of Inovelon Treatment

Overall,  59  (14.9%;  17.2%  in  all -ages  patients)  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  had  84  adverse reactions that resulted in the discontinuation or interruption of Inovelon treatment. The most common (≥2.0% incidence) were somnolence (3.0%; 3.1% in all -age s patients), decreased appetite (2.5%; 3.4% in allages patients), and epilepsy (2.0%; 2.0% in all -ages patients).

In total, 69 (17.4%; 18.7% in all -ages patients) paediatric and adolescent patients had 99 AEs that resulted  in  the  discontinuation  or  interruption  of  Inovelon  treatment.  The  most  common  (≥2.0% incidence) were decreased appetite and somnolence (3.0% each; 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively, in allages patients), and epilepsy (2.5%; 2.3% in all -ages patients).

## Occurrences of Unexpected Adverse Reactions and Adverse Events

Six (1.5%; 1.3% in all -ages patients) patients had a total of 10 unexpected serious adverse reactions. The most common (≥0.3% incidence) unexpected, serious  adverse  reaction  was  pyrexia  in  3  patients  (0.8%;  0.4%  in  all -ages  patient s);  all  other unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported in 1 subject each.

In total, 166 (41.9%; 38.9% in all -ages patients) paediatric and adolescent patients experienced 357 events reported as unexpected AEs. The most common (≥2.0% incidence) unexpected AEs were upper respiratory  tract  infection  (8.8%;  7.1%  in  all -ages  patients ),  bronchitis  (4.6%;  4.3%  in  all -ages patients), gammaglutamyltransferase increased and pyrexia (3.5% each; 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively, in allages patients), contusion, nasopharyngitis and pneumonia (3.0% each; 2.6%, 4.0%, and 2.3%, respectively, in allages patients), fall (2.8%; 3.1% in all -ages patients), insomnia (2.5%; 3.0% in all -ages patients), influenza (2.3%; 1.9% in all -ages patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirtyfive  (8.8%; 6.4% in all -ages patients) patients had a total of 58 unexpected SAEs. The most common (≥1.0% incidence) unexpected SAEs were pneumonia in 9 patients (2.3%; 1.6% in all -ages patients) and pyrexia in 7 patients (1.8%; 1.1% in all -ages patients).

## Adverse Reactions and Adverse Events Resulting in Fatalities

The incidence of AEs resulting in death was 1.0% for paediatric and adolescent patients (0.7% for allages patients in the study). The AEs were cardiorespiratory arrest, renal failure, trisomy 18 and pyrexia; none of these events were adverse reactions.

## CHMP comment:

The MAH presented the most reported AE s and ARs for overall population under 18 years old and the newly treated patients with LGS under 18 years old. The reportin g rates were compared to the overall population (including patients older than 18 years old).

Most  of  the  effects  reported  were  listed  in section  4.8  of  the  EU  SmPC  (somnolence,  decreased appetite, constipation, decreased weight, vomiting…). The frequency of listed effects was in line with the actual table presented in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Some e ffects not listed in the EU SmPC could be explained by patient's conditions or other coufounding factors. Indeed, pyrexia is noted in the subsection 'Pediatric population' but could be connected to effects listed in the SOC 'Infections and infestations' ,  e.g.  Pneumonia, influenza. Moreover, ' fall ', 'contusion' and other seizure-related events could be counfounded by the patient's condition or the following listed effects: 'convulsions' and 'status epilepticus'.

The MAH described unexpected events. The PTs reported were gammaglutamyltransferase increased, alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  and  aspartate  aminotransferase increased ,  which are  not consistent  with  the  listed  effects  'hepatic  enzyme  increase' in  section  4.8.  Moreover, irritability , insomnia and pneumonia were reported as unexpected events. Irritability is well described in the subsection 'Pediatric population' and is under close monitoring for the next PSUR (as part of the broad SMQ 'Hostility/Aggression').  Additional ly,  i nsomnia  and  pneumonia  are  well  listed  in  the  table  in section 4.8. Therefor e, it does not require further investigtion as the reported unexpected events were mainly in line with the safety profile of rufinamide.

Agitation is the most frequently reported PT within the SOC 'Psychiatric Disorders ' in both the overall paediatric population and paediatric patients newly treated with rufinamide. In the overall population there  were  13  cases  of  agitation corresponding  to  3,28%  of  the  study 's  enrolled  patients.  When focusing on patients under 18 years old, 11 cases were identified, and in newly treated patients under 18 years old, 9 cases were identified. Additionally, agitation led to six discontinuations of treatment, according to the MAH, in total. During the last PSUSA, the MAH was requested to provide detailed information on cases reported under the broad SMQ 'Hostility/Aggression.' Following the review, there was  insufficient  evidence  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between  the  reported  effects  and rufinamide. This topic remains under close monitoring and will be further discussed in the next PSUR. The MAH is requested to provide the CIOMS of cases of agitation (serious and non -serious cases) reported during the interval of the study INO01T in patients under 18 years old. Moreover, the MAH is requested to discuss the potential role of rufinamide in the occurrence of this effect by providing a detailed cumulative review of reports found. Each case should be thoroughly assessed, and the MAH should discuss the need for an update of the Product Information. ( RSI )

## Priority Study Items

- -Status Epilepticus Events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of status epilepticus as an adverse reaction (and serious adverse reaction) was 2.3% in paediatric and adolescent patients (3.4% in all-ages patients in the study).

The incidence of status epilepticus as an adverse reaction was 2.7% in newly treated paediatric and adolescent patients with LGS (3.6% in newly treated all-ages patients in the study).

- -Skin Disorders, Drug -Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome and Oculomucocutaneous Syndrome (StevensJohnson Syndrome) Events

The incidence of skin-related adverse reactions was 2.5% in paediatric and adolescent patients (3.0% in allages patients in the study). The most common (≥0.5% incidence) skin -related adverse reactions were drug eruption and rash (0.8% each) in these patients (0.6% and 1.6%, respectively, in all-ages patients in the study). Serious adverse reactions were erythema multiforme and rash (0.3% each) in these patients (0.1% each in all-ages patients in the study).

In  newly  treated  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  with  LGS,  the  incidence  of  skin-related  adverse reactions was 3.1% (3.6% in newly treated allages patients in the study) and the most common (≥0.5% incidence) skin-related adverse reactions were rash (1. 0%; 2.0% in newly treated all -ages patients) and drug  eruption  (0.7%;  0.5%  in  newly  treated  all -ages  patients).  Serious  adverse  reactions  in  these patients were erythema multiforme and rash (0.3% each; 0 .2% each in newly treated all-ages patients). There were no occurrences of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or oculomucocutaneous syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in any patient in the study.

- -Central Nervous System Events

## CHMP comment:

The priority study items were status epilepticus events, skin disorders, Drug -Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome  and  Oculomucocutaneous  Syndrome  (StevensJohnson  Syndrome)  events  and  central Nervous System events.

Regarding  status  epilepticus,  the  frequency  in the  all  population  is  consi stent  with  the  frequency discribed in section 4.8 of the SmPC [1/10 - 1/100].

The incidence of skin-related adverse reactions was 2.5% in the overall paediatric population and reached 3.1% in the newly treated paediatric and adolescent patients with LGS. However, in the overall populati on under 18 years old, hypersensibility reported events were 'drug eruption', 'rash' and  'erythema  multiforme'  and  the  frequency  reported was 0.3%  and  0.8%.  In  the  SmPC Hypersensibility is referenced with a frequency between 1/1000 and 1/100, which is consistent with the study data. When focusing on ne wly treated paediatric and adolescent patients with LGS, the incidence of hypersensibility related reactions was 1.0% and 0.7% which is also consistent with the information in the SmPC. There were no occurrences of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or oculomucocutaneous syndrome (StevensJohnson syndrome) in any patient in the study.

The incidence of CNS adverse reactions was 26.0% in paediatric and adolescent patients (28.6% in all-ages  patients  in  the  study).  The  most frequently reported PTs were somnolence, epilepsy and status epilepticus. For each effect , the reporting rate was in line with the SmPC's information. In newly treated  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  with  LGS,  the  incidence  of  CNS  adverse  reactions  was 26.2% and the most common CNS adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the general population under 18 years old, with comparable proportion. Serious adverse reactions included status epilepticus, epilepsy, seizure, somnolence, LGS, and seizure cluster.

There is no signal identified through the priority study items.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of CNS adverse reactions was 26.0% in paediatric and adolescent patients (28.6% in allages  patients  in  the  study).  The  most  common  (≥2.0%  incidence)  CNS  adverse  reactions  were somnolence (18.2%), epilepsy (3.5%) and status epilepticus (2.3%) in these patients (18.4%, 4.0% and  3.4%,  respectively,  in  all-ages  patients  in  the  study).  Serious  adverse  reactions  were  status epilepticus (2.3%), epilepsy (0.8%), and seizure, somnolence, LGS, and seizure cluster (0.3% each) in these patients (3.4%, 1.3%, 0.1% each, respectively, in all-ages patients in the study). In newly treated paediatric and adolescent patients with LGS, the incidence of CNS adverse reactions was 26.2%; the most common (≥2.0% incidence) CNS adverse reactions were somnolence (18.4%), epilepsy (3.7%) and  status  epilepticus  (2.7%).  Serious  adverse  reactions  in  these  patients  were  status  epilepticus (2.7%), epilepsy (0.7%), and LGS and seizure cluster (0.3% each).

## Occurrences of Adverse Reactions Related to QT/QTc Interval Shortening or Proarrhythmic Effects

The following events (preferred terms) were tabulated as events related to QT/QTc interval shortening or proarrhythmic effects, with reference to the definitions in the clinical studies:

- Events included in the Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Query (SMQ) 'Cardiac arrhythmias' (broad scope)
- Events included in the high-level term 'ECG investigations,' excluding events whose description contains the word 'normal' and events corresponding to test names/test items
- Events classified as 'postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,' 'sinusoidal foetal heart rate pattern,' or 'sudden unexplained death in epilepsy'

There were no incidences of adverse reactions related to QT/QTc interval shortening or proarrhythmic effects in paediatric and adolescent patients.

## Occurrences of Decreased Appetite-Related Adverse Reactions

The incidence of decreased appetite-related adverse reactions in paediatric and adolescent patients was 8.1% (9.8% in allages patients); the reported event was decreased appetite (8.1%; 9.8% in all -ages patients).

The  incidence  of  decreased  appetite-related  adverse  reactions  for  newly  treated  paediatric  and adolescent  patients  was  9.5%  (11.3%  in  newly  treated  allages  patients);  the  reported  event  was decreased appetite (9.5%; 11.3% in newly treated all -ages patients).

## Occurrences of Withdrawal Symptoms-Related Adverse Reactions

The following events (preferred terms) were tabulated as withdrawal symptoms-related events:

- Events included in the SMQ 'Drug withdrawal' (broad scope)
- Of events classified as 'epilepsy' or 'status epilepticus,' events in which exacerbation of epileptic seizures occurred during the period from the start date of Inovelon administration tapering until 2 weeks after treatment discontinuation.
- Events classified as 'epilepsy' or 'status epilepticus' at the onset of withdrawal symptoms in patients who were reported to 'have' withdrawal symptoms based on the assessment of the 'presence/absence of withdrawal symptoms'.

The incidence of withdrawal symptoms-related adverse reactions in paediatric and adolescent patients was  0.5%  (1.3%  in  allages  patients);  the  reported  events  were  epilepsy  (0.3%;  0.7%  in  all -ages patients) and withdrawal syndrome (0.3%; 0.3% in all -ages patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP comment:

There were no incidences of adverse reactions related to QT/QTc interval shortening or proarrhythmic effects in paediatric and adolescent patients.

The incidence of decreased appetite-related adverse reactions in paediatric and adolescent patients (newly treated or not) was in line with the frequency known and noted in the SmPC. In both arms, the reported event was decreased appetite.

The incidence of withdrawal symptoms-related adverse reactions in paediatric and adolescent patients was 0.5% and the reported events were epilepsy and withdrawal syndrome .  Section  4.2  and  4.4 mention specific warnings about discontinuation and withdrawal risk.

## Other Safety Findings

## Occurrences of Adverse Reactions in Patients With Renal Impairment

Overall, 12 paediatric and adolescent patients had renal impairment at Baseline; 3 (25.0%; 44.0% in all-ages patients with renal impairment) patients experienced 3 adverse reactions, 1 of which was a serious adverse reaction (seizure). There were 284 (29 serious) events reported as adverse reactions among  176  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  without  renal  impairment;  the  incidence  of  adverse reactions was 46.2% (49.0% in all-ages patients without renal impairment). Direct comparisons on the patient groups with and without renal impairment were inconclusive because the number of patients with renal impairment was very small; however, the incidence rates of adverse reactions in the presence and absence  of  renal  impairment,  in  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients  and  in  all-ages  patients  were comparable.

## Occurrences of Adverse Reactions in Patients With Hepatic Impairment

Overall, 11 paediatric and adolescent patients had hepatic impairment at Baseline; 4 (36.4%; 53.1% in all-ages patients with hepatic impairment) patients experienced 5 adverse reactions, 2 of which were serious  adverse  reactions  (2  patients  with  status  epilepticus).  There  were  282  (28  serious)  events reported as adverse reactions among 175 paediatric and adolescent patients without hepatic impairment; the incidence of adverse reactions was 45.8% (48.6% in all-ages patients without hepatic impairment). Direct comparisons on the patient groups with and without hepatic impairment were inconclusive because the  number  of  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  was  very  small;  however,  the  incidence  of  adverse reactions in the presence and absence of hepatic impairment, in paediatric and adolescent patients and in all-ages patients were comparable.

## Effects of Inovelon on Intellectual Disability and Sexual Dysfunction

In  the  overall  population  (including  paediatric  and  adolescent  patients),  there  were  no  relevant observations in any patient in the study.

## Occurrences of SuicideRelated Adverse Events

In the overall population (paediatric and adolescent patients), there were no relevant observations in any patient in the study.

## Use in Children 3 Years Old or Younger

Inovelon was administered in 17 children 3 years old or younger. The incidence of adverse reactions was 35.3%; the most common (≥10.0% incidence) adverse reactions were pyrexia (17.7%) and agitation (11.8%). Serious adverse reactions were pyrexia (11.8%), rash and rhabdomyolysis (5.9% each). The incidence and profile of adverse reactions are consistent with that observed in the all-ages population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Use in Children with Body Weight Below 15 Kilograms

Inovelon was administered to 52 paediatric patients weighing less than 15.0 kg. The incidence of adverse reactions was 44.2%; the most common (≥10.0% incidence) adverse reaction was somnolence (19.2%). Serious adverse reactions were pyrexia (3.9%), rash and rhabdomyolysis (1.9% each). The incidence and profile of adverse reactions are consistent with that observed in the all-ages population.

SuicideRelated Adverse Events

In the overall population (paediatric and adolescent patients), there were no relevant observations in any patient during the study.

Use in Children 3 Years Old or Younger

Inovelon was administered to 17 children aged 3 years old or younger. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia (17.7%) and agitation (11.8%). The incidence and profile of adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in the all-ages population or with the events described in the Peadiatric population section of SmPC 4.8 Further information is requested in RSI regarding agitation.

Use in Children with Body Weight Below 15 Kilograms

Inovelon was administered to 52 paediatric patients weighing less than 15.0 kg. The most common adverse reaction was somnolence. The incidence and profile of adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in the all-ages population.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study INO01T was a specified prospective, post-marketing, multicentre, observational study conducted in Japan in children over 4 years old and adults with LGS. Patients included in the study were treated with Inovelon after a diagnosis of LGS.

The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrences of expected and unexpected adverse reactions and priority study items, as well as the long term efficacy and the factors that may affect safety or efficacy related to the long-term use of Inovelon Tablets in routine clinical practice in patients with LGS.

Based on the overall data for paediatric and adolescent patients and all-ages patients derived from this study, Inovelon was effective in reducing seizure frequency over long-term (up to 2 years of observation) treatment, as assessed by the proportion of less than 18 years old subjects with a 50% reduction in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seizures from Baseline (42% [59/141 patients]) and the efficacy rate in the patients aged&lt;18 years old with LGS in the study (42% (100/243 patients )) . These results are consistent with those observed for the all-ages population (all study patients, regardless of age).

The safety results of the study reported that 180 paediatric patients (45.5%) experienced at least one AE. When scrutinizing in more detail with the PT classification, the most common AEs were those already stated in the SmPC, with a similar frequency: somnolence, decreased appetite, constipation, decreased weight, vomiting... Some AEs were reported as unexpected, such as pyrexia, fall, contusion, seizure, gamma-glutamyltransferase increase, alanine aminotransferase increase and aspartate aminotransferase increase. However, they could be explained and/or confounded by other listed effects (Pneumonia,  influenza,  convulsions,  status  epilepticus,  hepatic  enzyme  increase).  Overall,  the  AEs reported were largely consistent with the known safety profile of the substance, and no new information was identified through the priority study items or the review focused on specific effects or populations.

Regarding agitation events, 11 cases were reported in patients under 18 years old, and more specifically 9 cases in newly treated patients. Events of agitation led to six treatment discontinuations without further details. As this PT was one of the most reported PTs in the SOC Psychiatric disorders in the last PSUR and is under close monitoring as part of the broad SMQ 'Hostility/Aggression', the MAH is requested to provide the CIOMS of cases of agitation (serious and non-serious cases) reported during the interval of the study INO01T in patients under 18 years old. Moreover, the MAH is requested to discuss the potential role of rufinamide in the occurrence of this effect by providing a detailed cumulative review of reports found. Each case should be thoroughly assessed, and the MAH should discuss the need for an update of the Product Information. ( RSI )

Overall, the cases detailed by the MAH did not provide enough information to conclude on the role of rufinamide in the occurrence of agitation, due to co-suspect medications, poor documentation of cases and/or concomitant medical history. Agitation is included in the SMQ 'hostility/aggression', which will be closely  monitored  for  the  next  PSUR:  'The  MAH  is  requested  to  provide  a  detailed  review  of  cases retrieved with the broad SMQ Hostility/aggression that occurred in the period. CIOMS forms should be provided  for  the  serious  cases.  Cases  must  be  thoroughly  assessed  (time  to  onset,  co-suspect  and concomitant medications, outcome, risk factors, dechallenge or rechallenge if applicable) and the MAH should propose an update of the product information if necessary.'

The conclusions of the MAH are considered acceptable and no changes to the product information are deemed necessary.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.

## Not fulfilled:

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. The MAH is requested to provide the CIOMS of cases of agitation (serious and non-serious cases) reported during the interval of the study INO01T in patient under 18 years old. Moreover, the MAH is requested to discuss the potential role of rufinamide in the occurrence of this effect by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

providing  a  detailed  cumulative  review  of  reports  found.  Each  case  should  be  thoroughly assessed, and the MAH should discuss the need for an update of the Product Information.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

1. The MAH is requested to provide the CIOMS of cases of agitation (serious and non-serious cases) reported during the interval of the study INO01T in patient under 18 years old. Moreover, the MAH is requested to discuss the potential role of rufinamide in the occurrence of this effect by providing  a  detailed  cumulative  review  of  reports  found.  Each  case  should  be  thoroughly assessed, and the MAH should discuss the need for an update of the Product Information.

Among the 702 patients included in the safety analysis, there were 294 patients under the age of 18 who received rufinamide during Study INO01T. Of the 294 patients, 12 experienced an adverse event under the MedDRA PT of agitation. Of these 12 events, 1 was serious and 11 nonserious.

The serious verbatim event of excitement is described below:

- This report () describes a  who received Inovelon 1600 mg/day for the treatment of LennoxGastaut syndrome. Approximately 603 days after initiating Inovelon, the patient experienced excitement and was hospitalized. Inovelon was discontinued approximately 3 months later, and the event improved 2 months following discontinuation. The patient had no reported medical history. Concomitant medications included valproate sodium, clobazam, levetiracetam, carbocisteine,  ambroxol  hydrochloride,  cromoglicate  sodium,  and  bisacodyl.  The  reporter considered the event to be probably related to Inovelon treatment.

In each of the 11 nonserious reports, excitement was reported as the adverse event. The ages of the patients ranged from 3 years to 16 years, with a mean age of 8 years and consisted of 7 males and 4 females. The latency period ranged from 3 days to 215 days, with an average of 44 days and a median of 14 days. Rufinamide doses varied from 200 mg to 1200 mg. Among these patients, the actions taken with rufinamide, and the outcomes of the adverse event are as follows: 4 continued with  rufinamide  (2  recovered,  2  recovering),  5  discontinued  rufinamide  (1  not  recovered,  1 recovering, 3 recovered), and 2 had their dose reduced (1 recovered, 1 recovering). All patients were receiving adjunctive antiepileptic medication, with 2 also on antipsychotics. Eight of the 11 patients had underlying nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, such as autism, tuberous sclerosis, microencephaly, dementia, intellectual disabilities, and developmental delays.

A cumulative review of the reports of agitation (serious and non-serious) reported during the interval of Study INO01T in patients under 18 years old looking at such factors as, seriousness, sex and age distribution, comorbidities, concomitant medications, individual type of event, underlying incidence of such events in the population, and the number of patients exposed to rufinamide, does not suggest any trend or pattern to indicate a new safety concern with the pediatric use of rufinamide.

Agitation in children and adolescents can stem from various causes, with pain and anxiety often being primary factors. Additionally, patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) frequently exhibit hyperactivity, inattention, anxiety, agitation, depression, and aggression.  These  symptoms complicate their care, disrupt daily activities, hinder educational and social progress, and significantly impact  their  quality  of  life.  LGS  also  affects  cognitive  development,  with  approximately  90%  of children  with  LGS  experiencing  intellectual  impairment.  Many  patients  (20-60%)  show  delayed development at onset of LGS.  Research by Sabaz et al. indicates that children with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities have a higher rate of behavioural disturbances compared to those without intellectual disabilities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, the agitation events observed in this study align with the established safety profile of rufinamide  and  the  medical  conditions  typically  seen  in  children  and  adolescents  prescribed  this medication. Therefore, these findings do not alter the overall safety profile of rufinamide as outlined in the product information. Consequently, this review does not warrant an update to the product information at this time.

## CHMP comment:

During study INO01T, 12 cases in patient under 18 years old were reported for the PT agitation. The exposure was 294 patients under 18 years old among a total of 702 patients. One case was serious and the 11 remaining were non serious.

Serious case () describes a  who received Inovelon 1600 mg/day for the treatment of Lennox -Gastaut syndrome. Approximately 603 days after initiating Inovelon, the patient experienced excitement and was hospitalized. Inovelon was discontinued approximately 3 months later, and the event improved 2 months  following  discontinuation.  The  patient  had  no  reported  medical  history.  Concomitant medications included valproate sodium, clobazam, levetiracetam, carbocisteine, ambroxol hydrochloride, cromoglicate sodium, and bisacodyl. The reporter considered the event to be probably related to Inovelon treatment.

Despite the lack of medical history and the late positive dechallenge, agitation appeared after a long latency of about 20 months after introduction of rufinamide and 17 months since last dose escalation. Moreover, the patient was treated with three concomitant medications associated with agitation, as listed  in  their  SmPC  valproate  sodium  (common),  clobazam  (common),  and  levetiracetam (uncommon) - without detailed information on the timing of the introduction of these treatments. This case was reviewed in the procedure P SUSA/00002671/201601 .

The MAH provided a line listing of the 11 remaining nonserious events reported for PT agitation. The ages of the patients ranged from 3 years to 16 years, with a mean age of 8 years and consisted of 7 males and 4 females. 8 of the 11 patients had underlying nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, such as autism, tuberous sclerosis, microencephaly, dementia, intellectual disabilities, and developmental delays. The latency period ranged from 3 days to 215 days, with an average of 44 days and a median of 14 days. Rufinamide doses varied from 200 mg to 1200 mg. Adverse events severity was mild (8 patients) to moderate (3 patients). The actions taken with rufinamide, and the outcomes of  the  adverse  event  are  as  follows:  4  continued  with  rufinamide  (2  recovered,  2  recovering),  5 discontinued rufinamide (1 not recovered, 1 recovering, 3 recovered), and 2 had their dose reduced (1 recovered, 1 recovering). All patients were receiving adjunctive antiepileptic medication (valproate sodium,  lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topirmate…), with 2 also on antipsychotics (olanzapine, aripiprazole).

According to the MAH, agitation in children and adolescents can have various causes, with pain and anxiety as primary factors. Children with epilepsy and LGS more frequently exhibit symptoms such as agitation and are at a higher risk of developing delayed development and intellectual impairment. In conclusion, the MAH cites the research of Sabaz et al., which indicates that children with epilepsy and intellectual  disabilities  have  a  higher  rate  of  behavioral  disturbances  compared  to  those  without intellectual disabilities. This is agreed.

Overall, the cases detailed by the MAH did not provide enough information to conclude on the role of rufinamide in the occurrence of agitation, due to co-suspect medications, poor documentation of cases and/or concomitant medical history. Agitation is included in the SMQ 'hostility/aggression', which will be closely monitored for the next PSUR: 'The MAH is requested to provide a detailed review of cases retrieved with the broad SMQ Hostility/aggression that occurred  in  the  period.  CIOMS  forms  should  be  provided  for  the  serious  cases.  Cases  must  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

thoroughly assessed (time to onset, co -suspect and concomitant medications, outcome, risk factors, dechallenge  or  rechallenge  if  applicable)  and  the  MAH  should  propose  an  update  of  the  product information if necessary.'

The conclusions of the MAH are considered acceptable and no changes to the product information are deemed necessary. Issue solved.
