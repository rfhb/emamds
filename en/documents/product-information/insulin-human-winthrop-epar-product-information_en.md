<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Shelf life after first use of the cartridge

The cartridge in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

The pen containing a cartridge must not be stored in the refrigerator.

The pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

## Unopened cartridges

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).

Do not freeze.

Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

## In-use cartridges

For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container 3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)). Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 cartridges are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Insulin pen The Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the cartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cartridges

Before insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents.

Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times).

After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cartridge yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement changes substantially.

Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). Empty cartridges must not be refilled.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

## It must be remembered that

- -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range,
- -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Mixing of insulins Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

## Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).

Each pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 25% dissolved insulin and 75% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must never be injected intravenously.

Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Handling of the pen

Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

## Eyes disorders

A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.

Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)).

Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). The cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector. Injection needles are not included in the pack. Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 pens are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Before first use, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes substantially. Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Handling of the pen

The patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet carefully before using SoloStar.

Schematic diagram of the pen

<!-- image -->

## Important information for use of SoloStar:

- Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be performed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed without a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar.

· Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. · The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. Storage instructions Please check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. If SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. The used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. Maintenance SoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. The outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. The pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should avoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be damaged, he must use a new one. Step 1. Check the insulin Medicinal product no longer authorised

The label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used.

After removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked:

The insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should be mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should be turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

## Step 2. Attach the needle

Only needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should be carefully attached straight onto the pen.

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Prior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly and to remove air bubbles.

## A dose of 2 units has to be selected.

The outer and inner needle caps should be removed.

While holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.

Then the injection button should be pressed in completely. If insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. If no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. Step 4. Select the dose The dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. The dose window must show '0' following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. Step 5. Inject the dose The patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. The needle should be inserted into the skin. The injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle The needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles mut not be re-used. Special caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). Each vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% dissolved insulin and 70% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli . For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a vial. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

Special populations

Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must never be injected intravenously. Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -alcohol consumption,
- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Medication errors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.

Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Eyes disorders A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles
- and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

Protamine sulphate, metacresol, phenol, zinc chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, glycerol, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water for injections.

Pharmacodynamic effects Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved insulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. 6.

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such as thioles and sulphites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mixing of insulins

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with insulin human formulations designed specifically for use in insulin pumps.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must also not be mixed with insulins of animal origin or with insulin analogues.

Insulins of different concentration (e.g. 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml) must not be mixed.

Care must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

## Shelf life after first use of the vial

The product may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose.

Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Unopened vials Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Opened vials For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container 5 ml suspension in a vial and 10 ml suspension in a vial (type 1 colourless glass) with a flanged cap (aluminium), a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a tear-off cap (polypropylene). Packs of 1 and 5 vials are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It must be remembered that

- -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range,
- -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

## Mixing of insulins

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2.

If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.

-in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency), -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Pens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges

The Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:

- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 in 0.5 unit dose increments

- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 in 1 unit dose increments.

These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been established with the listed pens.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country.

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

## Eyes disorders

A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved insulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action.

5.3 Preclinical safety data The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Protamine sulphate, metacresol, phenol, zinc chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, glycerol, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water for injections. 6.2 Incompatibilities This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such as thioles and sulphites. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Mixing of insulins

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with insulin human formulations designed specifically for use in insulin pumps.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must also not be mixed with insulins of animal origin or with insulin analogues.

Care must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

Shelf life after first use of the cartridge

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The cartridge in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

The pen containing a cartridge must not be stored in the refrigerator.

The pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

## Unopened cartridges

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).

Do not freeze.

Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

## In-use cartridges

For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

6.5 Nature and contents of container 3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)). Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 cartridges are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Insulin pen The Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the cartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cartridges

Before insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents.

Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times).

After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cartridge yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement changes substantially.

Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). Empty cartridges must not be refilled.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

## It must be remembered that

- -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range,
- -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Mixing of insulins Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concernig incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. Any unused medicinalproduct or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

## Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).

Each pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% dissolved insulin and 70% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must never be injected intravenously.

Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Handling of the pen

Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

## Eyes disorders

A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.

Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved insulin) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 19 hours.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Protamine sulphate, metacresol, phenol, zinc chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, glycerol, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water for injections. 6.2 Incompatibilities This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such as thioles and sulphites. Mixing of insulins Medicinal product no longer authorised

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues.

Care must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

## Shelf life after first use of the pen

The pen in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

Pens in-use must not be stored in the refrigerator.

The pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Not in-use pens: Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack.

Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

## In-use pens

For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)).

Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). The cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector. Injection needles are not included in the pack. Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 pens are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Before first use, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes substantially. Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. It must be remembered that -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Handling of the pen

The patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet carefully before using SoloStar.

Schematic diagram of the pen

<!-- image -->

## Important information for use of SoloStar:

- Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be performed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed without a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar.

· Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. · The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. Storage instructions Please check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. If SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. The used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. Maintenance SoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. The outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. The pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should avoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be damaged, he must use a new one. Step 1. Check the insulin Medicinal product no longer authorised

The label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used.

After removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked:

The insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should be mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should be turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

## Step 2. Attach the needle

Only needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should be carefully attached straight onto the pen.

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Prior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly and to remove air bubbles.

## A dose of 2 units has to be selected.

The outer and inner needle caps should be removed.

While holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.

Then the injection button should be pressed in completely. If insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. If no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. Step 4. Select the dose The dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. The dose window must show '0' following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. Step 5. Inject the dose The patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. The needle should be inserted into the skin. The injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle The needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles mut not be re-used. Special caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). Each vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% dissolved insulin and 50% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a vial. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin).

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must never be injected intravenously. Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.

Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Eyes disorders A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

## Shelf life after first use of the vial

The product may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

Immediately before withdrawal from the vial into the injection syringe, the insulin must be resuspended. This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted appearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose.

Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Unopened vials Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Opened vials For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container 5 ml suspension in a vial (type 1 colourless glass) with a flanged cap (aluminium), a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a tear-off cap (polypropylene). Packs of 1 and 5 vials are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Before withdrawing insulin from the vial for the first time, remove the plastic protective cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes give the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It must be remembered that

- -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range,
- -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

## Mixing of insulins

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2.

If two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the shorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting preparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg) of the active substance. Each vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% dissolved insulin and 50% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a vial. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

Only injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin).

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must never be injected intravenously. Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.

Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must never be injected intravenously.

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection area must be rotated from one injection to the next. For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment. In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients:

- -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved,

-in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency), -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Pens to be used with Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges

The Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges should only be used with the following pens:

- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 in 0.5 unit dose increments

- OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 and AllStar which all deliver Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 in 1 unit dose increments.

These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been established with the listed pens.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country.

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

Eyes disorders A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

## Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved insulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such as thioles and sulphites.

5.3 Preclinical safety data The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. 6.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Mixing of insulins

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with insulin human formulations designed specifically for use in insulin pumps.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must also not be mixed with insulins of animal origin or with insulin analogues.

Care must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Shelf life after first use of the cartridge

The cartridge in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

The pen containing a cartridge must not be stored in the refrigerator.

The pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

## Unopened cartridges

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).

Do not freeze.

Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

## In-use cartridges

For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 6.5 Nature and contents of container 3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)). Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 cartridges are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Insulin pen The Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen malfunctions (see instructions for using the pen), the suspension may be drawn from the cartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cartridges

Before insertion into the pen, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents.

Later on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times).

After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cartridge yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement changes substantially.

Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). Empty cartridges must not be refilled.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or external or implanted insulin pumps.

## It must be remembered that

- -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range,
- -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Mixing of insulins Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed specifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).

Each pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% dissolved insulin and 50% crystalline protamine insulin.

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. After resuspension, milky-white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen (doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,
- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.

Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).

Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).

If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include: -change in the injection area, -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), -inadequate food intake, -missed meals, -alcohol consumption, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.

## Handling of the pen

Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medication errors

Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins.

## Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone

Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.

## Fertility

No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Immune system disorders

Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.

Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolism and nutrition disorders

Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.

In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.

Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

## Eyes disorders

A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.

Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. General disorders and administration site conditions Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. Management Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01.

## Mechanism of action

Insulin

- -lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- -increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- -increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- -promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- -enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved insulin) is an insulin with rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic effects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Protamine sulphate, metacresol, phenol, zinc chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, glycerol, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water for injections. 6.2 Incompatibilities This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with solutions containing reducing substances such as thioles and sulphites. Mixing of insulins Medicinal product no longer authorised

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues.

Care must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin suspension.

## 6.3 Shelf life

2 years.

## Shelf life after first use of the pen

The pen in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat or direct light.

Pens in-use must not be stored in the refrigerator.

The pen cap must be put back on the pen after each injection in order to protect from light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Not in-use pens

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).

Do not freeze.

Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

## In-use pens

For storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

3 ml suspension in a cartridge (type 1 colourless glass) with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber (type 1)) and a flanged cap (aluminium) with a stopper (bromobutyl or laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber (type 1)). Each cartridge contains 3 balls (stainless steel). The cartridges are sealed in a disposable pen injector. Injection needles are not included in the pack. Packs of 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10 pens are available. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling Before first use, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of the contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. After resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 must not be used if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes sometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform suspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes substantially. Empty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. It must be remembered that -insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, -the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Handling of the pen

The patient should be advised to read the instructions for use included in the package leaflet carefully before using SoloStar.

Schematic diagram of the pen

<!-- image -->

## Important information for use of SoloStar:

- Before each use, a new needle must always be carefully attached and a safety test must be performed. A dose should not be selected and/or the injection button should not be pressed without a needle attached. Only use needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar.

· Special caution must be taken to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · SoloStar must never be used if it is damaged or if the patient is not sure if it is working properly. · The patient must always have a spare SoloStar available in case the SoloStar is lost or damaged. Storage instructions Please check section 6.4 for instructions on how to store SoloStar. If SoloStar is in cool storage, it should be taken out 1 to 2 hours before injection to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. The used SoloStar must be discarded as required by your local authorities. Maintenance SoloStar has to be protected from dust and dirt. The outside of the SoloStar can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. The pen must not be soaked, washed or lubricated as this may damage it. SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. The patient should avoid situations where SoloStar may be damaged. If the patient is concerned that the SoloStar may be damaged, he must use a new one. Step 1. Check the insulin Medicinal product no longer authorised

The label on the pen should be checked to make sure it contains the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used.

After removing the pen cap, the appearance of the insulin should also be checked:

The insulin suspensions (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures) should be mixed by turning SoloStar up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. The pen should be turned gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge. After mixing, the insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

## Step 2. Attach the needle

Only needles that are compatible for use with SoloStar should be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A new sterile needle will be always used for each injection. After removing the cap, the needle should be carefully attached straight onto the pen.

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Prior to each injection, a safety test has to be performed to ensure that pen and needle work properly and to remove air bubbles.

## Select a dose of 2 units.

The outer and inner needle caps should be removed.

While holding the pen with the needle pointing upwards, the insulin reservoir should be tapped gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.

Then the injection button should be pressed in completely. If insulin has been expelled through the needle tip, then the pen and the needle are working properly. If no insulin appears at the needle tip, step 3 should be repeated until insulin appears at the needle tip. Step 4. Select the dose The dose can be set in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If a dose greater than 80 units is required, it should be given as two or more injections. The dose window must show '0' following the safety test. The dose can then be selected. Step 5. Inject the dose The patient should be informed on the injection technique by his health care professional. The needle should be inserted into the skin. The injection button should be pressed in completely. Then the injection button should be held down 10 seconds before withdrawing the needle. This ensures that the full dose of insulin has been injected. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle The needle should always be removed after each injection and discarded. This helps prevent contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin. Needles mut not be re-used. Special caution must be taken when removing and disposing of the needle. Recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles must be followed (e.g. a one handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.

Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).

Each vial contains 10 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin).

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in a vial. Clear, colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin pumps. It is specially stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and thermal stress in such pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is therefore also suitable for continuous insulin infusion with other, conventional injection syringe pumps. The desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

When used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously (\"basal rate\"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the operating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the necessary safety precautions.

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, and the rest is given as bolus injections before meals.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment.

Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat may be infused by the subcutaneous route. It is designed for use in the Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron insulin pumps. It may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown that they are suitable for this insulin (see pump manual). Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Insulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment available for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas). Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given injection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days). For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions.

In case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient has recovered complete consciousness.

In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. Hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia). Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered.

Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include:

- -change in the injection area,
- -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors),
- -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,
- -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea),
- -inadequate food intake,
- -missed meals,
- -alcohol consumption,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Insulin pump faults

Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed completely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to a bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction.

In the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or pen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps, refer to the operator's manual.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely. Medication errors Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine).

Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. Fertility No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented.

Description of selected adverse reactions Immune system disorders Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such anti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia. Metabolism and nutrition disorders Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Eyes disorders

A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.

Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia.

## Management

Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose regimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.

More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and if it is of a water-like consistency .

For use in an infusion pump, Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is filled into the sterile cartridge of the pump. The cartridge must only be used once.

Before use, the filled cartridge must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Air bubbles must be removed before starting the infusion (see the operator's manual for the pump).

If the infusion pump malfunctions, the solution may be drawn from the cartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected.

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps.

It must be remembered that neutral regular insulin precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4). Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). Each cartridge contains 3.15 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 315 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin).

Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in a cartridge. Clear, colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin pumps. It is specially stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and thermal stress in such pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is therefore also suitable for continuous insulin infusion with other, conventional injection syringe pumps. The desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. Daily doses and timing of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

When used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously (\"basal rate\"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the operating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the necessary safety precautions.

There are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, and the rest is given as bolus injections before meals.

## Secondary dose adjustment

Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if

- -the patient's weight changes,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -the patient's life-style changes,
- -other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly population ( ≧ 65 years old)

In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.

## Renal impairment

In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.

Patients hypersensitive to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and - where necessary - in conjunction with anti-allergic treatment.

Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat in cartridges may be infused by the subcutaneous route. It is designed for use in the Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron insulin pumps. It may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown that they are suitable for this insulin and this type of cartridge (see pump manual). Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used. Insulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment available for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas) . Insulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given injection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days). For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions.

In case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient has recovered complete consciousness.

In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Transfer to Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.

The need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.

Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.

Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in particular in patients who

- -were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- -have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- -previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.

Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. Hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia). Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: -in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, -in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, -who are elderly, -after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, -in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, -with a long history of diabetes, -suffering from a psychiatric illness, -receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered.

Adherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment. These include:

- -change in the injection area,
- -improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors),
- -unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,
- -intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea),
- -inadequate food intake,
- -missed meals,
- -alcohol consumption,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency),
- -concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.

## Insulin pump faults

Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed completely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to a bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction.

In the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or pen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps, refer to the operator's manual.

## Intercurrent illness

Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely. Medication errors Medication errors have been reported in which other Insulin Human Winthrop formulations or other insulins have been accidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins. Combination of Insulin Human Winthrop with pioglitazone Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insulin Human Winthrop is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine).

Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are available. Insulin does cross the placental barrier, although not in clinically significant amount. A limited amount of data on pregnant women (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes reported) exposed to marketed insulin human indicates no safety issues in use of insulin human in pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.

It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.

## Breast-feeding

The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

No effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. Fertility No clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented.

Before use, Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Air bubbles must be removed before starting the infusion (see the operator's manual for the pump).

If the infusion pump malfunctions, the solution may be drawn from the cartridge into an injection syringe (suitable for an insulin with 100 IU/ml) and injected.

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It must be remembered that neutral regular insulin precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5.

Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin human and other insulins (see section 4.4).

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Special patient groups

If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- -fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting. Do not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.

Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin . Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

## · Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

Once in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a lamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label.

· Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Opened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast--eeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

Once in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a lamp) Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label.

· Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Rapid Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Opened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) Medicinal product no longer authorised

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \").

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid \"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm), -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.

What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special patient groups

If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Oher medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- -fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),
- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have problems with your sight.

Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- -the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting. Do not use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.

Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen.

Look at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen. If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used.

If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml.

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should

-If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the cartridge after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened cartridges Medicinal product no longer authorised

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.

Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar has to be used.

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

## If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid

- -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

-Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

## · Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other side effects include (frequency annot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

- Skin and allergic reactions

Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.

Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) Medicinal product no longer authorised

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm), -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.

What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

- A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
- B. Take off the pen cap.
- C. Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using clear insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid), do not use this pen if the insulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles.

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A. Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B. Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B. Dispose of the needle safely.
- C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Basal contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insulin Human Winthrop Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Basal and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Basal next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early .

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- -the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Basal contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insulin Human Winthrop Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Basal. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Basal and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and

- Oedema ankles.
- Injection site reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

Once in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a lamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the label.

· Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Basal next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Opened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) Medicinal product no longer authorised

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia) , you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.

Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm), -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia - In your body Medicinal product no longer authorised

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.

What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal with alcohol. Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- -the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Basal into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Basal cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen.

If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Hun Winthrop Basal -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Mix-ups

You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Basal and other insulins.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)

Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

· Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) · Sodium retention · Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),

-you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), Medicinal product no longer authorised

A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.

Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar has to be used.

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Basal than you should

-If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Basal , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Basal -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Basal This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Basal and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put the pre-filled pen next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Basal Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the pen after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Not in-use pens Medicinal product no longer authorised

## In-use pens

Pre-filled pens in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a lamp). The pen in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use the pen after this time period.

Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Basal\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Human Winthrop Basal SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

- A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
- B. Take off the pen cap.
- C. Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.

<!-- image -->

After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A. Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B. Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B. Dispose of the needle safely.
- C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after 'EXP' and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia) , you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia) , you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15.\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Oother medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),

The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blodd vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always use a new cartridge must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen.

If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Mix-ups

You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)

Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

· Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) · Sodium retention · Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia) , you may not have injected enough insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop comb 15\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\").

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),

-you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. How to handle SoloStar SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. Read carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.

Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar has to be used.

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 and other insulins. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not know). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

- A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
- B. Take off the pen cap.
- C. Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.

<!-- image -->

After  mixing  check  the  appearance  of  your  insulin.  Insulin  suspensions  must  have  an evenly milky-white appearance.

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A. Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B. Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B. Dispose of the needle safely.
- C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),

A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicine except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions caanot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,

- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 . Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin HumaWinthrop Comb 25 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from availabla data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop comb 25\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen.

If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Mix-ups

You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)

Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

· Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) · Sodium retention · Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\").

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),

-you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. How to handle SoloStar SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. Read carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.

Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar has to be used.

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 25 Solostar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

- A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
- B. Take off the pen cap.
- C. Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.

<!-- image -->

After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

.

<!-- image -->

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A. Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B. Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B. Dispose of the needle safely.
- C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial must also be used if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened vials Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen.

If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Insulin Mix-ups

You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)

Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

· Injection site urticaria (itchy rash) Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) · Sodium retention · Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\").

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines).

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. How to handle SoloStar SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. Read carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put the pre-filled pen next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

## Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,

-your insulin pen does not work properly, -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Medicinal product no longer authorised

Examples include:

- -you inject too much insulin,
- -you miss meals or delay them,
- -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\").

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

2. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.

## Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:

If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

## Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 30 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurseor call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

A Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.

- B Take off the pen cap.
- C Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.

<!-- image -->

After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

<!-- image -->

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B Dispose of the needle safely.
- C Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

- In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

- In your brain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.

If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off cap on the vial. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special care before injection

Before injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin human preparations as detailed below.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.

Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50. Inject as soon as you have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins. 4.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

## Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,

-you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin. What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you inject too much insulin,
- -you miss meals or delay them,
- -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- -you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\").

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.

## Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:

If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.

It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 per day you will need,
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

## Frequency of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.

## Method of administration

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices. How to handle the cartridges To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: - JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units - OptiPen, ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24 or AllStar which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin well and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.

## Special care before injection

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

- -Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- -Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- -Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.

-

-

## Problems with the pen?

## Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for using the pen.

## If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used.

If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well. However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml. If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin HumaWinthrop Comb 50 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention

· Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. · Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the cartridge after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb  50 Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.

Frequency of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. Method of administration Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. Do NOT inject Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 into a vein. SoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. How to handle SoloStar SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing human insulin. Read carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use. A new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. A safety test must be performed before each injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again immediately before each injection.

Mixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge.

After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.

Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you think you have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.

## Special care before injection

Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.

Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.

Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar has to be used.

If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 than you should -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. -Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.

Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Oedema

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles.

- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 peopel)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

## Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put the pre-filled pen next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

· Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. · Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which isstated on the carton and on the label of the pen after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Not in-use pens Medicinal product no longer authorised

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.

## HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pen does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \" Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \" Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:

- -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.

## Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,

-you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \" Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50\"). In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.

## Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 50 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use.

SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.

Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.

Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.

<!-- image -->

You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. Schematic diagram of the pen Important information for use of SoloStar: · Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. · Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. · Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). · This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else. · If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. · Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.

## Step 1. Check the insulin

- A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insulin Human Winthrop SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insulin Human Winthrop insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
- B. Take off the pen cap.
- C. Check the appearance of your insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a suspension insulin (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal or Insulin Human Winthrop mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.

<!-- image -->

After mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.

<!-- image -->

Step 2. Attach the needle Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks. Before use of needle, carefully read the 'Instructions for Use' accompanying the needles. Please note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. A. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. B. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). · If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Step 3. Perform a safety test

Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by:

- ensuring that pen and needle work properly
- removing air bubbles
- A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.

C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. · If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. · If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. · If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose Medicinal product no longer authorised

- A. Check that the dose window shows '0' following the safety test.
- B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
- You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.

## Step 5. Inject the dose

- A. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- B. Insert the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to '0' as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: · Contamination and/or infection · Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
- B. Dispose of the needle safely.
- C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Storage instructions

Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.

If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.

Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.

## Maintenance

Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.

You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.

<!-- image -->

Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special patient groups

If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- -If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).

In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- -somatropin (growth hormone),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.

If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- -the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat per day you will need, how much of this is infused continuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \"insulin boost\" (\"bolus dose\"),
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a solution to be given under the skin.

Your doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how often you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the insulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. Do not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in which you must not start or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for these pumps. How to handle the vials Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat has been developed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. It must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will tell you how to use it. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency. The insulin cartridge of the pump must be sterile and must be used once only. After filling the cartridge of the pump keep it at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before using it, so that you can see and remove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. Special care before injection Before starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must NOT be mixed with any other insulin preparations.

## Insulin pump faults

You should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired blood sugar levels,

- -you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or
- -you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual.

For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual.

If the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe for injection. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml.

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

## If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

- -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

<!-- image -->

-Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and

- Oedema ankles.
- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

- Skin and allergic reactions

Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.

Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) Medicinal product no longer authorised

If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.

## Why does hyperglycaemia occur?

## Examples include:

- -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage,
- -your insulin pump does not work properly,
- -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\").

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. Why does hypoglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you inject too much insulin, -you miss meals or delay them, -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, -you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm), -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

## - In your body

Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.

## - In your brain

Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.

What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia 1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that you are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor.

## Special patient groups

If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Travel

Before travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about

- -the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- -supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- -correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- -whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump,
- -timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- -the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- -possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- -what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.

## Illnesses and injuries

In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:

- -If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).

-If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take. Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include : -all other medicines to treat diabetes, -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), -disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), -fluoxetine (used to treat depression), Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- -monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- -pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- -sulfonamide antibiotics.

## Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include :

- -corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\", used to treat inflammation),
- -danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- -diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- -glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- -isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- -oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- -phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -somatropin (growth hormone),
- -sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- -thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- -protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- -atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine).

## Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take :

- -beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- -lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).

Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.

Betablockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat with alcohol Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. Driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: -you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), -you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), -you have problems with your sight. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:

- -you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- -the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

## 3. How to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

## Dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will

- -determine how much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat per day you will need, how much of this is infused continuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \"insulin boost\" (\"bolus dose\"),
- -tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- -tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat.

Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.

## Method of administration

Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat is a solution to be given under the skin.

Your doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how often you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the insulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. Do not use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in which you must not start or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for these pumps. How to handle the cartridges Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat comes in cartridges designed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. It must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will tell you how to use it. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency. Keep the cartridge at room temperature 1 to 2 hours before inserting it in the pump so that you can see and remove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. Special care before injection Before starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat must NOT be mixed with any other insulin preparations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.

## Insulin pump faults

You should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired blood sugar levels,

- -you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or
- -you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual.

For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual.

If the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe for injection. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml.

## If you use more Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat than you should

- -If you have injected too much Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat , your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

## If you forget to use Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat

- -If you have missed a dose of Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat or if you have not injected enough insulin , your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.

<!-- image -->

-Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Insulin Mix-ups You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat and other insulins. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) . The specific frequency cannot be estimated from available data (frequency not known). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet. Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body); severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Frequency of these reactions cannot be estimated from available data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Side effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and

- Oedema ankles.
- Injection site reactions

## Side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)
- Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other side effects include (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- Sodium retention
- Eye reactions

A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

- Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)

If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken. Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well. Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes.

- Skin and allergic reactions

Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.

Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5. How to store Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the cartridge after 'EXP'. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Unopened cartridges Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Once in the pump, Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat may be kept for up to 2 weeks. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. 6.

## This leaflet was last revised in {date}

Other source of information Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu/ HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. Why does hyperglycaemia occur? Examples include: -you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for example through incorrect storage, -your insulin pump does not work properly, -you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia

Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.

## What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia

Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)

If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.

## Why does hypoglycaemia occur?

Examples include:

- -you inject too much insulin,
- -you miss meals or delay them,
- -you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- -you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,

-you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, -you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, -you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, -you are recovering from an illness or from fever, -you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\"). Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: -you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, -your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, -you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm), -you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia - In your body Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. - In your brain Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if

- -you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- -you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- -you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- -you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insulin Human Winthrop,
- -you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat\").

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.

## What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia

1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that you are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.

Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised
