## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Palonosetron  Hospira  250  micrograms  solution  for  injection  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  the active substance palonosetron. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Palonosetron is an antiemetic agent. It is presented as a white to off white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and soluble in methanol. Chemically it is (3aS)-2-[(3S)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1H-benz[de]isoquinolin-1-one hydrochloride.

The reference medicinal product is Aloxi, palonosetron hydrochloride, 250 micrograms solution for injection of Helsinn  Birex  Pharmaceuticals  Ltd,  Ireland,  was  authorised  on  22/03/2005  via  centralised  procedure (authorisation number: EU/1/04/306). Therefore, according to the legislation, the applicant is not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials as the medicinal product is a generic of a reference product, which has been authorised in the Community for at least 10 years. The  applicant  is  applying  for  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Palonosetron  Hospira,  which  has  the  same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and also is of the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product. The safety and efficacy profile of palonosetron for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy has been demonstrated in several clinical trials for the reference medicinal product. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this active substance. The indications for Palonosetron Hospira are identical to the indications of Aloxi and are as follows: Palonosetron Hospira is indicated in adults for: · the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, · the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Palonosetron Hospira is indicated in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for: · the  prevention  of  acute  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic  cancer  chemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Palonosetron Hospira should be used only before chemotherapy administration. This medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional under appropriate medical supervision. The posology is 250 micrograms of palonosetron administered as a single intravenous bolus approximately 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. Palonosetron Hospira should be injected over 30 seconds. The efficacy of Palonosetron Hospira in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a corticosteroid administered prior to chemotherapy.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The  finished  product  is  presented  as  a  solution  for  injection  containing  250 µ g  of  palonosetron  (as hydrochloride salt) as active substance.

<!-- image -->

Other ingredients are: mannitol, disodium edetate, sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water for injections. The  product  is  available  in  type  I  glass  vials  with  chlorobutyl  rubber  stoppers  and  aluminium  seals  as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 2.2.2. Active substance General information The  information  on  Palonosetron  hydrochloride  is  provided  according  to  the  Active  Substance  Master  File (ASMF) procedure. The chemical name of palonosetron hydrochloride is (3a S )-2-[( S )-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6hexahydro-1-oxo1H -benz[de]isoquinoline hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C19H24N2O and a relative molecular mass of 332.8 g/mol. It has the following structure: The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of  1 H and  13 C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy,  UV  spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry  and  elemental  analysis.  The  polymorphic  form  was characterised by XRPD. The  active  substance  is  a  white  to  off-white  non-hygroscopic  crystalline  powder,  very  soluble  in  aqueous media across the physiological pH range. Palonosetron  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  two  chiral  centres  which  originate  in  the starting materials. Enantiomeric and diastereomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Polymorphism has not been observed for palonosetron hydrochloride.

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Palonosetron  hydrochloride  is  synthesized  in  three  main  steps  using  well-defined  starting  materials  with acceptable specifications.

Adequate in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and have been demonstrated to adequately control any stereoisomeric impurities.

The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  is  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Limits for several impurities have been set in intermediates, which ensures they are adequately  purged  by  subsequent  steps.  The  absence  of  genotoxic  impurities  has  been  adequately demonstrated.

Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch.  Forced  degradation studies were carried out in solution at reflux in water, aqueous acid, base or with peroxide and in the solid state at high temperature. Palonosetron is stable to light and high temperature. It degrades to an extent in solution,  more  so  in  base  than  in  acid,  although  the  greatest  degradation  is  observed  under  oxidative conditions.

The active substance is doubly packaged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags inside polypropylene (PP) drums, the materials of which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. Specification The active substance specification as shown below includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), water content  (KF),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur.),  impurities  (HPLC),  enantiomeric impurities (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC and HS-GC), chloride content (potentiometric titration),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  content  (Ph.  Eur.).  Impurities  levels  are  set  in accordance with the ICH Q3A thresholds for a daily posology of 0.25 mg. The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, according to Ph. Eur. 2.6.12, the ability of the test for  microbial  quality  to  detect  microorganisms  in  the  presence  of  the  active  substance  needs  to  be established.  Further  validation  work  to  address  this  omission  is  on-going  and  the  applicant  committed  to providing the data prior to product launch. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Stability Stability data on six production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the  intended  commercial  package  for  up  to  36  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH) according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Data  on  four  of  the  batches  stored  for  6  months  under accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  were  also  provided.  The  following  parameters  were  tested: appearance, identity, water content, impurities, enantiomeric impurities and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No trends were observed and all measured parameters remained within their specification limits throughout the study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  36  months  in  the  proposed  container, without special storage conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

The finished product is a sterile aqueous solution containing 0.25 mg palonosetron (as hydrochloride salt) in 5  ml  solution.  The  aim  of  development  was  to  deliver  a  finished  product  qualitatively  and  quantitatively identical to the reference product, Aloxi. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined to ensure the product  is  pharmacologically  equivalent  to  Aloxi,  meeting  or  exceeding  the  relevant  quality  standards. Accordingly,  the  QTPP  was  defined  as  a  clear  colourless  solution  for  injection  in  an  appropriate  primary container containing 0.05 mg/ml  palonosetron with a suitable shelf-life and meeting  the required specifications  for  impurities,  assay,  volume,  pH,  osmolarity,  oxygen  content  and  sterility.  Following  a  risk assessment and subsequent investigations, critical quality attributes (CQAs) were defined as appearance, pH, assay, impurities and sterility.

Palonosetron  hydrochloride  is  freely  soluble  across  the  physiologically  relevant  pH  range  and  highly permeable (BCS I).  A  risk  assessment  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  active  substance  attributes  with  the potential to impact finished product quality, and those considered important, (appearance, impurities, assay, microbiological quality), are controlled in the active substance specification. Since the formulation is identical to  that  of  the  reference  product  which  has  a  shelf-life  of  5  years  and  is  thus  very  stable,  no  excipient compatibility studies were deemed necessary. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Given the route of administration and the formulation relative to Aloxi, no bioequivalence study was required. QbD principles were applied to the development of the manufacturing process. An overall risk assessment was carried out to identify  the  individual  steps  with  potential  to  impact  the  CQAs  of  the  finished  product. Additional risk assessments were carried out on the individual process steps to evaluate the potential impact of process parameters of unit operations and input material attributes on the quality of the output materials. This was used to guide development of the process and define parameters in order to ensure the quality of the finished product. Terminal sterilisation is used to ensure sterility of the product as it has been shown to be thermally stable. The  primary  packaging  is  a  type  I  glass  vial  with  a  chlorobutyl  rubber  stopper  and  aluminium  seal.  The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: preparation of bulk solution; sterile filtration; filling; sealing; sterilisation; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. In-process controls are carried out after critical operations and are considered adequate. The applied process parameters are well justified. Holding times  for  intermediates  have  been  investigated  and  defined.  The  sterilisation  process  has  been  validated whilst a validation scheme for the rest of the process has been provided and is considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Product specification

The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and comprise  tests  for  appearance,  extractable  volume  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (UV,  HPLC),  osmolarity  (Ph. Eur.),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  extractables  (HPLC),  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and particulate matter (Ph. Eur.). The levels set for impurities are in line with the ICH thresholds for a daily posology of 0.25 mg and historic data.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  production  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Stability of the product Stability data on three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 18 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Palonosetron  Hospira  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for appearance,  osmolarity,  pH,  assay,  impurities,  sterility,  particulate  matter  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. There were no significant trends to any of the measured parameters and all remained within specification throughout the studies. A maximum of 0.2% total impurities was observed under accelerated testing. In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug  Substances  and  Products.  A  slight  increase  in  one  stereoisomer  and  an  unspecified  impurity  was observed although both were within specification. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months without special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. Adventitious agents No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress,  the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

The ability of the test for microbial quality to detect microorganisms in the presence of the active substance should be demonstrated. Validation data should be provided prior to commercialisation of the product.

<!-- image -->

The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of non-clinical studies based on the claim that Palonosetron Hospira is a generic of the reference product Aloxi. The literature data presented in the dossier  is  considered  acceptable  and  sufficient  for  the  assessment  of  non-clinical  aspects  of  Palonosetron Hospira in the applied indications.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based  on  up-to-date  and  adequate  scientific  literature.  The  overview  justifies  why  there  is  no  need  to generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  non-clinical aspects  of  the  SmPC  are  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product.  The  impurity  profile  has  been discussed based on the Guideline CPMP/ICH/2738/99 and was considered generally acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies were required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Palonosetron Hospira manufactured by Hospira UK Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  palonosetron  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the environment  to  the  active  substance.  Thus,  the  environmental  risk  is  expected  to  be  similar  and  not increased. 2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects The applicant provided a justification for not conducting any toxicological and pharmacological studies as the indications proposed and the pharmaceutical form and strength of Palonosetron Hospira are the same as for the reference product Aloxi.  Instead, the applicant provided a review of the literature for the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and toxicological studies of palonosetron to support the claim that the generic product Palonosetron Hospira is similar to the reference product Aloxi. The information in the SmPC section 5.3 is the same as for the reference product. 2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of palonosetron hydrochloride based on published literature. The relevant SmPC sections are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

<!-- image -->

Palonosetron  at  the  recommended  dose  is  widely  distributed  in  the  body  with  a  volume  of  distribution  of approximately 6.9 to 7.9 l/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins.

No formal scientific advice by the CHMP has been requested for this medicinal product. GCP The applicant did not submit clinical trials with this application. Exemption The  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  250  micrograms  per  vial  (5ml)  of  Palonosetron  Hospira  is classified as an abridged 'generic' application under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended). Palonosetron  Hospira  Solution  for  Injection  has  been  developed  as  a  pharmaceutical  equivalent  of  Aloxi solution  for  injection,  (Helsinn  Birex  Pharmaceuticals  Limited,  Ireland).  Palonosetron  Hospira  is  essentially similar  to  the  approved  reference  product,  Aloxi.  Palonosetron  Hospira  is  qualitatively  and  quantitatively identical  in  composition  to  that  of  Aloxi.  The  active  ingredient,  dosage  form,  route  of  administration  and strength  of  Palonosetron  Hospira  are  identical  to  those  of  the  reference  medicinal  product.  Palonosetron Hospira is presented in packs of 1 vial containing 5 mL of solution, which is the same as Aloxi. As per the guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, the applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study if the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous (IV) solution containing the same active drug substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product. Palonosetron hydrochloride solution is intended for IV use and contains the same active drug substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product and therefore, no bioequivalence studies were required. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics The applicant provided a literature review of the PK aspects of palenosetron. Following palonosetron intravenous administration, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by slow elimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours. Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞ ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 -90 μ g/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Palonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40% eliminated through the kidney and with approximately 50% metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After a single intravenous dose of 10 micrograms/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered  within  144  hours  in  the  urine  with  palonosetron  representing  approximately  40%  of  the administered dose, as unchanged active substance. After a single intravenous bolus administration in healthy subjects the total body clearance of palonosetron was 173 ± 73 ml/min and renal clearance was 53 ± 29 ml/min. The low total body clearance and large volume of distribution resulted in a terminal elimination halflife in plasma of approximately 40 hours. Ten percent of patients have a mean terminal elimination half-life greater than 100 hours.

<!-- image -->

The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of clinical studies based on the claim that Palonosetron Hospira is a generic of the reference product Aloxi. As the product contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the same route of administration as for the reference product, the lack of bioequivalence studies is considered acceptable. The literature data and the publicly available information presented in the dossier are considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of clinical aspects of Palonosetron Hospira in the applied indications.

2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted by the applicant. 2.4.4. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data were submitted by the applicant. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical aspects No new pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were presented. A summary of the literature with regard  to  clinical  data  of  Palonosetron  Hospira  was  provided  and  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP.  No  postmarketing data were submitted by the applicant as this product has not been marketed in any country. The summary of literature referred to the proposed indications in adult patients. During the procedure, the applicant aligned the indication with the indication of the reference product Aloxi which included paediatric patients 1 month of age and older. The  product  Palonosetron  Hospira  contains  the  same  active  ingredient  in  the  same  concentration  and pharmaceutical formulation using the same route of administration as for the reference product. It has an identical qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active substance as its reference medicinal product. It also contains the same excipients are used. As it is indicated for intravenous administration and in accordance  to  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1,  Appendix  II,  Parenteral  solutions,  bioequivalence  can  be concluded without the need for further studies. There are no expected differences in non-clinical or clinical effects are expected. Main safety concerns identified with the reference product were severe constipation and severe  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Important  potential  risks  (as  for  other  5HT3  antagonists)  are  QT/QTc prolongation and serotonin syndrome. 2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy,   the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. During the procedure, the applicant aligned the indication with the reference product and included paediatric patients 1 month of age and older. No nonclinical studies have been submitted for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on  these  clinical  aspects  based  on  information  from  published  literature  was  considered  sufficient  and acceptable.

A  bioequivalence  study  was  not  submitted  and  this  was  considered  acceptable  as  Palonosetron  Hospira contains  the  same  active  ingredient  in  the  same  concentration  and  pharmaceutical  formulation  using  the same route of administration (parenteral) as for the reference product. The CHMP, having considered the quality data provided as well as the non-clinical and clinical information submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  Palenosetron  Hospira  is  comparable  to  the  reference product Aloxi in the applied indication and that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those  included  in  the  product  information.  Therefore,  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  Palenosetron  Hospira  is considered positive. 4. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk  balance  of  Palonosetron  Hospira  in  adults  for  the  prevention  of  acute  nausea  and  vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, and in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer  chemotherapy,  is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
