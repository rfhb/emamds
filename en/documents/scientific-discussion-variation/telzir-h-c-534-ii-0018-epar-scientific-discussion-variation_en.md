## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1 Introduction

Telzir tablet and oral suspension contains fosamprenavir (FPV) which is the phosphate ester pro-drug of the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir (APV) and was developed to reduce the large pill burden and pill  size  associated  with  the  amprenavir  (Agenerase)  soft  gelatin  capsule  formulation.  Telzir  is approved  for  use  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV)  for  the  treatment  of  Human Immunodeficiency  Virus  Type  1  (HIV-1)  infected  adults  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral medicinal products. The recommended dose for adults is 700 mg twice daily, combined with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily.

At the time of approval of the initial Marketing Authorisation (MA) (indication for use of Telzir in adults;  12  July  2004),  no  paediatric  data  were  available.  The  MAH  had  committed  to  provide paediatric data by 31 December 2006. The present variation was submitted to extend the indication to include the use of Telzir tablet and oral suspension in paediatric patients. Hence, this Type II variation was submitted to address the post-authorisation commitment undertaken by the MAH in their letter of undertaking dated 24 March 2004.

It  is  relevant  to  mention  that  Agenerase  (amprenavir)  is  already  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in combination therapy for paediatric patients aged 4 years and above (dose 17 mg/kg oral solution three times daily). Because of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene glycol in Agenerase oral solution, it is contraindicated in infants and children below 4 years of age. Telzir oral suspension represents a significant improvement in that respect as it contains significantly lower concentrations of propylene glycol (10.2 mg/ml compared with 550 mg/ml); this extends the potential  option  of  fosamprenavir  treatment  to  children  below  the  age  of  4  years.  In  addition,  the fosamprenavir oral suspension contains no Vitamin E (compared with 46 IU/ml for Agenerase) and is more concentrated (50 mg/ml compared with 15 mg/ml), reducing the volume required per dose.

The MAH performed three dose finding open Phase II studies (still ongoing) in paediatric patients of which 2 studies,  namely  Study  APV29005 and Study APV20003, are considered most relevant for establishing the current dosing recommendation. In study APV29005,  twice  daily doses of fosamprenavir (with or without ritonavir) were administered to 75 children aged 2-18 years for 48weeks.  Dosing  and  analysis  were  performed  by  age  groups  (2-5,  6-11  and  12-18  years).  In  study APV20003, a once daily regimen was investigated in children aged 2-18 years, and in Study APV 20002, fosamprenavir oral solution + ritonavir were administered to 10 children aged &lt; 2 years old. The MAH considered Study APV29005 as pivotal, and the other two studies (the one with the once daily regimen (APV20003) and the other in the very young (APV20002)) as supplementary.

Based on the study outcomes regarding safety and PK simulation data (compared to reference adult plasma levels), the MAH proposed the following posology for children:

- For children aged 2-5 years old: fosamprenavir/ritonavir 20/3 mg/kg twice daily
- For  patients  aged ≥ 6  years  old:  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  18/3  mg/kg  twice  daily,  up  to  the standard adult fixed dose regimen of 700/100 mg twice daily for children and adolescents &gt; 39 kg

As a reminder, for a 70 kg adult, the dose is 10 mg/kg fosamprenavir twice daily in combination with ritonavir 100mg twice daily.

Due to few participants in study APV20002 and insufficient plasma exposure achieved after even 4.5fold  higher  doses/kg  than  in  adults,  no  dosing  recommendations  could  be  made  for  the  very young (children &lt; 2 years old).

For  this  application  the  CPMP  HIV  guideline  'Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal products  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection'  is  applicable  (November  2005  CPMP/EWP/633/02, Rev. 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2 Non-Clinical

No new non-clinical data were submitted in support of this variation application. The juvenile toxicity studies submitted in the framework of the original Marketing Authorisation Application for Telzir and in  the  framework  of  post-marketing  follow-up  indicate  that  the  safety  profile  of  fosamprenavir  in children ≥ 2 years of age is unlikely to be different to that seen in adult patients and support the safe clinical use of fosamprenavir in HIV-infected paediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age at the proposed recommend doses.

## 3 Clinical pharmacology - Pharmacokinetics

Due  to  the  different  dosage  regimens  employed  within  both  studies  (twice  daily  vs.  once  daily, boosted  vs.  unboosted,  different  mg/kg  doses),  evaluable  plasma  amprenavir  pharmacokinetic  (PK) data for fosamprenavir/ritonavir regimens in APV20003 and APV29005 are very limited; especially for  the  proposed  twice  daily  regimen,  only  a  very  limited  amount  of  plasma  amprenavir  data  is presented (table 1).

## Main Study APV29005

## Study Design

Study APV29005 is a Phase II, open-label, 48-week study designed to evaluate plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics, safety,  and  antiviral  activity  of  fosamprenavir  twice  daily  in  HIV-1  infected,  PInaïve  patients  2  to  5  years  old  and  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  PI-naïve  and  PIexperienced patients 2 to 18 years old.  Subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily were enrolled into age-defined cohorts of 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years. At the time of submission, insufficient PK data in the 2 to 5 year old cohort was available; therefore, this group is not discussed within this report.

Subjects received concurrent NRTIs and patients older than 6 years of age could receive enfuvirtide; NNRTIs  and  other  PIs  were  not  allowed  during  the  study.    Subjects  and/or  their  parents/legal guardians  were  instructed  to  administer  the  fosamprenavir  oral  suspension  with  food  in  order  to accommodate the frequent eating schedule of children, to enhance adherence through taste masking with  food,  and  to  improve  tolerability.    For  patients  in  each  age  cohort,  serial  PK  sampling  was conducted at Week 2 and trough sampling was conducted at all subsequent visits.

## Pharmacokinetic Population

Seventy-five  (75)  patients  were  enrolled,  67  patients  provided  plasma  amprenavir  C τ data  and 51 patients provided full plasma amprenavir PK profiles.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

## Fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in Patients 6 to 11 Years Old

Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily, paediatric  patients  6  to  11  years  old,  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  15/3  mg/kg  twice  daily  had 13%  lower  plasma  amprenavir  AUC(0τ )  and  23%  lower  Cmax  values,  but  similar  C τ values; whereas, patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily had 26% higher AUC(0τ ) and similar Cmax and C τ values (table 2).  Three 6 to 11 year old patients who weighed at least 39kg and received the adult tablet regimen of fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily had similar plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ )  and Cmax values, but 17% lower C τ values compared to adult values (table 2).

Paediatric patients 6 to 11 years old who received fosamprenavir 15 mg/kg or fosamprenavir 18 mg/kg in combination with ritonavir 3 mg/kg twice daily had 51% higher plasma ritonavir AUC(0τ ), similar Cmax,  and  2.58-fold  higher  C τ values  than  observed  in  the  historical  adult  population.    Similarly, paediatric  patients  6  to  11  years  old  who  weighed  at  least  33  kg  and  received  ritonavir  100 mg capsules had 43% higher plasma ritonavir AUC(0τ ),  similar  Cmax, and 3.04-fold higher C τ values than observed in the historical adult population.

## Fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in Patients 12 to 18 Years Old

The  majority  of  patients  in  the  12  to  18  year  old  age  group  received  the  adult  tablet  regimen  of fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily.  Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir  700/100mg  twice  daily,  12  to  18  year  old  patients  had  20%  lower  plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ ), 23% lower Cmax, and 20% lower C τ values (table 3).  Four patients in the 12 to 18 year old age group received fosamprenavir oral suspension at a dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15/3 mg/kg twice daily and plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ ) was 41% lower, Cmax 30% lower, and C τ 33% lower than observed in the historical adult population (table 3).

All of the 12 to 18 year old patients, except two patients who turned 12 years old during the study, received ritonavir 100  mg  capsules. Compared  to  the  historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily, 12 to 18 year old patients had 20% higher plasma ritonavir AUC(0τ ), similar Cmax, and 33% higher C τ values.

## First Supportive Study APV20003 - once daily regimen

## Study Design

Study APV20003 is a Phase II, open-label, 48-week study designed to evaluate plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily in antiretroviralnaïve and -experienced patients 2 to 18 years of age.  Patients were enrolled into three age-defined strata of 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 18 years.  Per protocol amendment ten patients (six in the 2 to 5, three in the 6 to 11, and one in the 12 to 18 year old age groups) switched to fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimens.

Patients  received  concurrent  NRTIs.  NNRTIs  and  other  PIs  were  not  allowed  during  the  study. Patients  and/or  their  parents/legal  guardians  were  instructed  to  administer  the  fosamprenavir  oral suspension with food in order to accommodate the frequent eating schedule of children, to enhance adherence  through  taste  masking  with  food,  and  to  improve  tolerability.    For  patients  in  each  age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stratum,  serial  PK  sampling  was  conducted  at  Week  4  and  trough  sampling  was  conducted  at  all subsequent visits.

## Pharmacokinetic Population

Sixty-nine  (69)  patients  were  enrolled,  55  patients  provided  plasma  amprenavir  C τ data  and 26 patients provided full plasma amprenavir PK profiles for the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily regimen. Two additional patients provided plasma amprenavir  C τ data for fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily only.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

For 12 to 18 year old patients receiving either the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily or the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg once daily regimen, plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ ) and Cmax appeared similar to and C τ appeared approximately 20% lower than values historically observed for adult patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg once daily.

For 6 to 11 year old patients receiving the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily regimen, on average,  plasma  amprenavir  AUC(0τ )  was  27%  lower  and  Cmax  was  30%  lower;  whereas,  C τ appeared  similar  to  values  historically  observed  for  adult  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg once daily.

For 2 to 5 year old patients receiving the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily regimen, on average, plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ ) was 30% lower, Cmax was 34% lower, and C τ was 30% lower than  values  historically  observed  for  adult  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  1400/200  mg once daily.

## Second Supportive Study APV20002 - very young children (&lt; 2 years)

## Study Design

Study APV20002 is a Phase II, open-label, 48-week study designed to evaluate plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of Fosamprenavir alone twice daily in HIV-1 infected, PI-naïve, paediatric patients and of Fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in PI-naïve and PIexperienced paediatric patients 4 weeks to &lt;2 years old.

Data from patients below the age of two are presented although currently no dosing recommendation can be given for this age group. Patients received concurrent NRTIs. NNRTIs and other PIs were not allowed.  Parents/legal guardians were instructed to administer the study drugs with food in order to accommodate the frequent eating schedule of children, to enhance adherence through taste masking with food, and to improve tolerability.

## Pharmacokinetic Population

All 13 enrolled patients underwent PK sampling during the study and 12 patients provided evaluable data.  Eleven patients provided plasma amprenavir PK profiles after administration of a single dose of fosamprenavir  30mg/kg.    Nine  patients  provided  steady-state  plasma  amprenavir  and  ritonavir  PK profiles at Week 2 and C τ data at subsequent visits.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

Nine 6 to &lt;24-month old paediatric patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimens ranging from 29.4/5.6 to 51.1/8.2 mg/kg twice daily had steady-state plasma CL/F values that were markedly higher than those observed in the historical adult population (table 4).

PK  parameter  values  were  highly  variable  (CVb%  ranging  from  113  to  165%  across  the  PK parameters) for the paediatric patients 6 to &lt;24 months old. Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir  in  paediatric  patients  6  to  &lt;24  months  significantly  reduced  plasma  amprenavir  CL/F  by approximately 60%.

Compared to the historical adult population, a subset of five paediatric patients ages 6 to &lt;24 months receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  45/7  mg/kg  twice  daily  demonstrated  that  despite  an  approximate 5-fold increase in fosamprenavir and ritonavir doses on a mg/kg basis, plasma amprenavir AUC(0τ ) was approximately 48% lower, Cmax 26% lower, and C τ 29% lower in the paediatric patients.

## Population PK model

The MAH developed a PPK model using pooled data from all three paediatric studies. The advantage of  population  modelling  is  that  plasma  samples  from  studies  with  different  dosing  regimens  (once daily and twice daily) and sparse and rich sampling could be integrated in one model. From the model, exposure data for different dosing regimens and different age groups were simulated, in search of an optimal dosing schedule.

## Population characteristics

The dataset was comprised of 137 patients aged 0.72-18 years, contributing 1322 plasma amprenavir concentrations.  The  median  age  was  10  years.  Body  weight  ranged  form  5.9-102.8  kg.  Baseline alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations ranged from 0.41-2.69 g/l. Only 18 patients received no ritonavir. In 33 cases, fosamprenavir was administered in fasted state.

## Structural model

Data were analysed using nonlinear mixed-effect modelling (NONMEM version V 1.1). Data were fitted to a two-compartment model plus an absorption compartment. The chosen parameters were Ka (absorption constant), V2/F (central compartment), CL/F (clearance from central compartment), V3/F (peripheral  compartment)  and  Q  (inter-compartmental  clearance).  CL  and  V  were  modelled  as  a function of weight (allometric scaling with 0.75 exponent).

In  the  base  model,  food,  ritonavir  intake  and  fosamprenavir  formulation  (tablet  or  oral  suspension) were taken into account.

Inter-individual variability (IIV, symbolised by η ) could be estimated for V2/F, CL/F and Q, but not for Ka. A co-variance term was defined for V2/F and CL/F (meaning that during estimating of IIV for CL and V2, co-variance  between  these  two  parameters  is  accounted  for).  Inter-occasion  variability (IOV) was estimated for CL/F. The error model was described by proportional + additive error. The FOCE-INTERACTION method was used throughout model development.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Final model

Co-variates race, gender and AAG level were included. Despite the fact that weight was included in the basic model, still a part of the variability of CL and V could be explained by gender and age.

## Population PK estimates

PPK parameter estimates are presenting a male child 10 years (35 kg), treated with suspension and food.  CL  without  ritonavir  was  estimated  as  84  l/hr,  versus  34  l/hr  when  booster  ritonavir  was administered. For comparison, in an adult model, the unboosted CL/F was estimated as 91.8 l/hr and boosted  CL/F  as  21.5  l/hr.  Weight-adjusted  CL/F  is  expected  to  be  1.4  point  greater  in  younger children (age 1.09 year) compared to children aged &gt; 4 years. The negative relationships between CL or V2 and AAG were reported before for adults (table 5).

Bioavailability (F) for oral solution was estimated to be 13% lower with food. When fosamprenavir was administered as tablet, F is 9% higher compared to oral solution. F was 15% lower for girls, and 6%  lower  for  African  children.  However,  the  95%  CI  of  these  categorical  co-variates  include  1, indicating that the effect could not be reliably estimated.

## Validation

The posterior predictive check, evaluation of residual distributions and goodness-of-fit plots indicated that the model described the data reasonably well.

## Simulation

Using  the  final  population  PK  model,  simulations  were  completed  to  predict  twice  daily  dosage regimens  that  would  deliver  target  plasma  amprenavir  AUC  and  C τ levels  in  adults  (AUC:  37.0 (mean)-64(max) µg/ml*hr, C τ (=Cmin): 1.55 (minimal)-3.52 (maximal) µg/ml).  For the simulations, doses  were  not  to  exceed  the  adult  tablet  dosing  regimen  and  doses  were  administered  under  fed conditions.  Based on the simulations, the following fosamprenavir/ritonavir dosage regimens and agestratifications were predicted:

- 2 to 5 years:

Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 23/3 mg/kg twice daily,

- ≤ 6 years:

Fosamprenavir /ritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily, up to adult tablet dosage regimen of

Fosamprenavir /ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily.

With these dosage regimens, the predicted plasma amprenavir plasma exposure values met the target for 2 to 11 year olds; for 12 to 18 year olds, the predicted geometric mean AUC(0τ ) and Cmin values were approximately 20% lower than the targeted adult exposure.

## Results

The main predictors of plasma amprenavir exposure, as determined by change in CL/F, were:

- The presence or absence of ritonavir, where co-administration of ritonavir was estimated to decrease plasma amprenavir CL/F by approximately 60%.
- Age,  where  weight  adjusted  CL/F  was  estimated  to  be  1.4-fold  greater  in  the  youngest children (1.09 years) as compared to children ≥ 5 years of age.
- Body weight, with a range of typical population CL/F estimates of 6.6 to 46.2L/hr across the weight range in the dataset.
- AAG, with a range of typical population CL/F estimates of 22.5 to 55.6 l/hr across the AAG range of 0.4 to 1.5g/l.

The main predictors of plasma amprenavir V2/F were:

- Body weight, with a range of typical population V2/F estimates of 32.1 to 432L across the weight range in the dataset.
- AAG, with a range of typical population V2/F estimates of 189 to 367L across the AAG range of 0.4 to 1.5g/l.

## Discussion on pharmacokinetics

The dose recommendation derived from the PPK model for children above the age of six is in line with the doses used in study APV29005 for this age group. The fact that for 12 to 18 year olds, the predicted  geometric  mean  AUC(0τ )  and  Cmin  values  were  approximately  20%  lower  than  the targeted adult exposure in the PPK model are to some extent balanced by the efficacy data for this age group.  Nevertheless,  this  positive  clinical  outcome  needs  to  be  further  substantiated  in  the  ongoing studies. Concerns, however, remain with the age group of children below the age of six.

The PPK model arrived at dosage recommendation for children that are based on kg BW and stratified into  two  age  groups  with  the  age  of  6  years  being  the  limit  between  the  two.  A  drawback  of  the currently  proposed  doses  based  on  these  age-classes  is  that  on  the  6th  birthday,  doses  should  be abruptly lowered.

In  addition,  according  to  the  PPK  model,  higher  doses  (23/3  mg/kg  fosamprenavir/ritonavir)  were predicted for children 2 to 5 years of age than currently recommended (namely 20/3 mg/kg) and used in study APV29005. Assuming the validity of the PPK model, there is a risk of under-dosing when the study  is  continued  with  the  lower  dose.  Therefore,  this  study  design  should  be  amended  to  either include  a  high-dose  study  arm  (parallel-design)  where  children  are  treated  with  23/3  mg/kg  or  an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interim analysis at an early stage to evaluate the adequacy of the 20/3 mg/kg dosing in order to avoid sub-optimal  plasma  levels.  The  MAH  has  addressed  this  need  by  committing  to  amend  the  study protocol to include a high-dose study arm (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

Given the current absence of data in children aged 2 to 5 years in the recommended dosage regimen, questions raised in regards to the feasibility of the dose change at 6 years of age as well as the critical issue  of  potential  under  dosing  identified  by  the  PPK  model  remain  unsolved.  Therefore,  no conclusion on the adequacy of the dose recommendation in children below the age of six can currently be  reached.  This  will  have  to  await  the  results  of  this  age  group  from  study  APV  29005,  once  the above amendments have been incorporated in an amendment of the study protocol (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

The fact that in study APV20002 (very young children of 6 to 24 months of age) no sufficient plasma levels could be achieved even after administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir doses up to 4.5-fold the adult ones raises major concerns.  This may not only be explained by the relatively higher CL in this age group, but may be due to an insufficient absorption of the oral solution, possibly because of a short gastrointestinal transit time in small children, or because of frequent vomiting and diarrhoea in HIVinfected children. The MAH should further research the underlying cause of this effect in the ongoing study (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

Even though no dosing recommendations could be made for this age group of very young children (&lt;2 years old) due to the small number of participants in study APV20002, the CHMP recommended that  a  warning  should  be  included  in  the  SPC  that  even  with  doses  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir 45/7 mg/kg twice daily no sufficient plasma exposure levels were achieved in a number of patients.

## 4 Clinical efficacy

## Main study APV29005 and First Supportive Study APV 20003

In Study APV29005 and Study APV20003, 126 paediatric patients above the age of two received at least one dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (table 6).

Ten patients in APV20003 switched to BID dosing; six in the 2 to 5 year age group, three in the 6 to 11 year age group, and one in the 12 to 18 year age group

## Methods

The main inclusion criterion for Studies APV29005 and APV20003 studies was similar:

- Patients for whom, following resistance testing where appropriate, an active NRTI backbone regimen consisting of two NRTIs could be constructed.

Patients must have also met one of the following criteria:

- ART-naïve patients who have not received any length of therapy with NRTIs and/or NNRTIs in study APV29005. APV20003 included patients with ≤ 4 weeks (28 days) therapy with an NRTI, no previous therapy with an NNRTI and less than one week therapy with a PI.
- ART-experienced patients (with NRTIs NNRTIs and/or a PI).
- PI-naïve patients: defined as having received less than 1 week of any PI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- PI-experienced  patients:  defined  as  having  prior  experience  with  no  more  than  three  PIs excluding Agenerase.  Prior ritonavir  boosted  PI  therapy  was  considered  as  only  one  PI  as long  as  the  ritonavir  dose  was  lower  than  that  recommended  for  use  of  ritonavir  as  an antiretroviral agent.

The main exclusion criteria for both studies were similar and were:

- The patient had a prior history of having received amprenavir.
- The  patient  had  NNRTI  therapy  within  14  days  prior  to  study  drug  administration  or anticipated need for concurrent NNRTI therapy during the study period.
- The patient had a malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which might interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.
- The  patient  had  any  serious  medical  condition  (e.g.,  haemoglobinopathy,  chronic  anaemia, diabetes, cardiac dysfunction, and hepatitis) which, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the safety of the patient.
- The patient  had  current  Grade  2  or  higher  serum  lipase  within  28  days  prior  to  study  drug administration and/or history of clinically relevant pancreatitis within the previous 6 months.
- The patient had Grade 3 or 4 transaminase levels (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase within 28 days prior to study drug administration and/or clinically relevant hepatitis within the previous 6 months.
- Treatment  with  protocol-excluded  medications  within  28  days  prior  to  receiving  study medication or the anticipated need during the study.

## Demographics and disease characteristics

Age groups, with the exception of FPV/RTV recipients in the 2 to 5 year age group (APV29005, 3 patients vs. 17 in APV20003), were similarly represented across the two studies. The median age was 12.0 years in both studies. Overall there were slightly more female patients than males, and patients were predominantly Caucasian.

The majority of paediatric patients were either mildly (Class A) or moderately (Class B) symptomatic at  baseline  according  to  the  CDC  Classification  for  children  &lt;13  years.    Likewise,  the  majority  of adolescents were CDC Class A or B at baseline.

The  baseline  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  levels,  median  CD4+  cell  counts  and  CD4+  percentages  were similar among PI-naïve and PI-experienced patients (table 7).

There were differences between the studies with regard to the median duration of prior exposure to NRTIs and NNRTIs for patients in the fosamprenavir/ritonavir group; this was substantially longer in study APV29005 compared to study APV20003 (table 8).

Abacavir/lamivudine  was  the  most  common  NRTI  initial  combination,  used  by  44%  (55/126)  of patients.  Most  PI-experienced  patients  enrolled  had  one  prior  PI  exposure  only  (predominantly nelfinavir).

## Antiviral response endpoints

Antiviral responses endpoints for studies APV29005 and APV20003 were secondary and included the proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  &lt;400  and  &lt;50copies/ml  over  time,  changes  from baseline  in  HIV-1  RNA  over  time,  changes  from  baseline  in  helper-inducer  T-lymphocyte  surface antigen  (CD4+)  cell  counts  and  CD4+  cell  percentages  over  time.  In  both  studies,  HIV  Genotypic Resistance testing (Geneseq, Monogram Biosciences Inc) was to be performed at baseline and at the time  of  protocol-defined  virologic  failure.    Due  to  the  open-label,  non-comparative  design  of  the paediatric studies, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed.  Descriptive methods were thus  used  in  analysis  of  the  data  obtained  from  these  studies.  Intent-to-Treat  Exposed  ITT(E) Population  was  the  primary  population  for  the  antiviral  response  analysis  in  these  two  studies,  and consisted  of  all  patients  with  documented  evidence  of  having  received  at  least  one  dose  of investigational product. Analyses of antiviral response for the ITT(E) Population included the TLOVR algorithm and Observed analysis.

## Results

## Patient disposition

The  proportion  of  premature  discontinuation  was  higher  in  APV20003  (43%  versus  18%)  in  the fosamprenavir/ritonavir  treatment  groups.  Patients  listed  as  discontinued  for  'Other'  reasons  were mainly due to being unable to adhere to or tolerate the taste of fosamprenavir/ritonavir, too low plasma amprenavir concentration at the end of the dosing interval, very bad compliance for all antiretroviral drugs generally and a pregnancy (table 9).

## Antiviral response

The majority of patients  in  both  studies  had  greater  than  48  weeks  of  exposure  to  study  treatment. However, the initially submitted interim study reports do not present antiviral response data beyond Week 24 for Study APV29005 because 3 patients in this study receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily did not reach their Week 24 visit evaluation but were still on therapy as of the data cut-off date. They were therefore classified as virologic failures in the TLOVR algorithm. Across the two studies, similar  proportions  of  PI-naïve  patients  and  of  PI-experienced  patients  achieved  HIV-1  RNA &lt;400copies/ml at Week 24 (table 10).

1. Nine patients were ART-naïve (Study APV29005)
2. Fifteen patients were ART-naive (Study APV20003)

The ITT (E) TLOVR analysis of the response by visit and PI status based on the plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml is summarised in the following table (table 11). The response rates were lower than those based on the analysis of the plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml.

The  reasons  for  non-response  was  primarily  due  to  virological  failure  (mainly  due  to  viral  level rebound in the PI-naïve patients versus never reaching viral load suppression in the PI-experienced patients)  followed  by  adverse  events  (with  a  higher  rate  in  the  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  once  daily dosing regimen in study APV20003). In both studies, the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level decreased over time.

There were differences in antiviral response across the age groups, although the differences were not consistent between studies (table 12).

The  groups  are  too  heterogeneous  with  regard  to  sample  size,  baseline  antiretroviral  experience, resistance profile and differences in fosamprenavir/ritonavir exposure and dosing regimens to derive meaningful conclusions by age category.

## Antiviral response in adolescents at week 48

In answer to the request for supplementary information, the MAH performed a preliminary Week 48 efficacy analysis of the 12-18 years old age group in APV29005 based upon laboratory data currently available.  Tables  13  and  14  below  present  the  Week  48  antiviral  response  for  adolescents  in APV290005.

Table 13 Proportion of Subjects with Quantitative Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/ml by Visit and PI Status for 12-18yr Age Group - TLOVR ITT (E) Population

| Visit    | PI-naïve (N=19)   | PI-exp. (N=10)   | Total (N=29)   |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Baseline | 0/19              | 1/10             | 0/29           |

Compared  to  Week  24,  the  two  additional  PI-naïve  patients  classified  as  failure  in  the  Week  48 TLOVR analysis comprised one virological rebound and one discontinuation while suppressed due to 'other'  reasons  captured  as    'poor  medical  compliance'  for  the  IP  discontinuation  data.  The  one additional PI-experienced patient classified as failure post Week 24 in the Week 48 TLOVR analysis was a virological failure at Week 48 due to plasma HIV-1 RNA rebound.

Table 14 Proportion of Subjects with Quantitative Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml by Visit and PI Status for 12-18yr Age Group - TLOVR ITT (E) Population

| Visit    | PI-naïve (N=19)   | PI-exp. (N=10)   | Total (N=29)   |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Baseline | 0/19              | 0/10             | 0/29           |
| Week 24  | 9/19 (47%)        | 4/10 (40%)       | 13/29 (45%)    |
| Week 36  | 12/19 (63%)       | 6/10 (60%)       | 18/29 (62%)    |
| Week 48  | 14/19 (74%)       | 6/10 (60%)       | 20/29 (69%)    |

Study outcomes at Week 48 using the &lt;50 copies/ml TLOVR analysis in the ITT(E) Population for PInaïve and PI-experienced adolescents respectively were as follows: 14/19 (74%) and 6/10 (60%) of were responders,  3/19  (16%)  and  3/10  (40%)  experienced  virological  failure.  In  addition,  three  PInaïve  adolescents  discontinued  study  drug  before  achieving  suppression  (n=2)  or  while  suppressed (n=1), one for adverse events and two for 'other' reasons.

Overall, the data show that the efficacy observed at Week 24 is generally sustained through Week 48, and that the majority of patients achieving viral suppression to &lt;400 plasma HIV-1 RNA copies/ml also achieved maximal suppression to &lt;50 copies/ml, especially in the group of PI-naïve patients.

## Immunological response

In the ITT(E) Observed analysis of the median change from baseline in CD4+ cells, increases (114 to 149 cells/mm 3 )  were  observed  at  Week  24  and  were  similar  between  the  PI-naïve  and  the  PIexperienced groups in Studies APV29005 and APV20003 (table 15).

Improvements were also observed in Week 24 CD4+ immune category results for patients who had both baseline and Week  24  data  in studies  APV29005  and  APV20003  (table  16).  Similar improvements were seen across the PI-naïve and PI-experienced groups in both studies. Roughly 1/3 of the patients showed improvement and 2/3 maintained their status. Week 48 results (not shown for study APV20003) showed a similar pattern.

## Disease progression

There was no disease progression or HIV-associated conditions reported in Study APV29005.  HIV disease progression during Study APV20003 occurred in one patient in the PI-experienced group, who developed a mycobacterial infection.

## Resistance data

Both genotype and phenotype analyses were performed in studies APV29005 and APV20003.

## APV29005

In this study, the majority of the ITT-exposed population was included in the Virology population at baseline,  comprising  82%  (47/57)  of  patients  and  including  87%  (26/30)  of  the  PI-experienced patients.    Nine  of  the  12  patients  classified  as  virological  failures  at  Week  24  (ITT[E]  TLOVR, ≥ 400 copies/ml) provided on-therapy analysis.  An additional seven patients were analysed for clinical management purposes following the investigator's request, but four of these were after only 4 weeks therapy.

In the group of ART experienced patients without significant phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir/ritonavir baseline (N=40), 38 were lacking amprenavir-associated mutations at baseline.    In  the  PI-experienced  group  (N=26),  2 patients  had  HIV  virus  with  &gt;4-fold  reduced susceptibility to amprenavir at baseline. Both experienced virologic failure.

Three  of  nine  patients  with  virological  failure  at  Week  24  with  on-therapy  genotypes  showed significant PRO mutation selection on-therapy.  Amprenavir resistance associated mutations selected were I54M/l (n=2), I50V (n=2), and I84V (n=2) (total number of patients: n=3) and these were always associated with phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir/ritonavir.  There was relatively little change in the  genomes  of  the  viruses  from  the  other  six  patients.    Of  the  seven  patients  analysed  at  the investigator's request, only one showed changes from baseline in protease.

## APV20003

Two virology populations were analysed: the NRTI-experienced population, and the Virology Failure Population.  Genotypic analyses were performed in the NRTI experienced subpopulation at screening (N=53)  to  help  construct  an  active  background  regimen  of  two  NRTIs,  and  both  genotypic  and phenotypic analyses were performed for patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;400 copies/ml at Week 24 or 48 or at the investigator's request (N=30).

Of  the  seven  patients  with  virological  failure  who  developed  amprenavir  resistance  associated mutations, six were in the PI-experienced group; one of these patients had an amprenavir mutation at baseline and selected I54L on therapy.  Six of the patients also had one or more TAMs at baseline, four of these with M184V; one patient did not have NRTI resistance-associated mutations.  Thus in six of these seven cases, it is likely that the NRTI had impact on the success of the regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On treatment analysis has shown that the highest absolute fold-changes in amprenavir resistance were observed  when  amprenavir  resistance  mutations  were  selected  into  a  background  of  other  PI mutations.    Of  a  total  of  11  patients  with  virus  showing  phenotypic  resistance  to  amprenavir  ontreatment,  10/11  were  previously  PI-experienced  patients  and  were  infected  with  virus  containing multiple PI-mutations at baseline, and 3/11 patients harboured viruses with phenotypic resistance to amprenavir at baseline.  Such isolates showed cross-resistance to other PIs except for LPV where 73% (8/11) remained below the clinical cut-off.

## Treatment Adherence in Study APV29005

The adherence was planned to be explored in this study:

- by the pill count and the visual assessment of full, partial or empty bottle
- by the Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) adherence questionnaire exploring the potential reasons for non-adherence (including taste, refusal, interference with lifestyle etc.)

Fosamprenavir adherence behaviour assessment was only available for 51% of patients.  The reasons for non-adherence were obtained for only 59% of patients at weeks 24. The lower rate of adherence was  observed  for  patients  aged  12-18  years  (73%  at  week  24).  The  rate  of  adherence  decreased between week 24 and week 48 for all cohorts; comprised between 86 % and 60% at week 48. By week 24,  the  major  reason  for  non-adherence  was  'taste,  can't  get  it  down,  spits  up,  amounts  of  pills  or liquid' in children less than 13 years and 'made me sick to my stomach; threw-up; it tasted badly'. Of note, the reporting of these events decreased over the course of the study.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Overall,  the  clinical  efficacy  data  submitted  in  support  of  this  type  II  variation  are  limited.  Those derived from study APV29005, which evaluated the efficacy of the recommended fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  regimen  when  used  in  combination  with  two  NRTIs  are  only supportive for the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in paediatric patients above the age of six, due to the lack of children evaluated for the lower age group. The MAH agreed to this restriction as  compared  to  the  initially  proposed  age  group  of  children  above  the  age  of  two  (see  also attachment 8  to  this  assessment  report).  In  the  supported  age  group,  however,  both  antiviral  and immunological responses were acceptable.

The  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  primarily  the  PK  and  safety  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  in children of all ages, who were antiretroviral therapy naïve or experienced, PI-naïve or experienced, and had variable baseline viral resistance.  Antiviral activity was a secondary endpoint only, which is consistent with ICH E11 guidance. The observed variability in antiviral response by age group was most likely due to differences in underlying baseline viral resistance or treatment experience of each individual patient rather than due to age per se. In APV29005, the majority of patients with any (one or  two)  primary  protease  mutations  were  in  the  6  to  11  age  group.    The  most  prevalent  primary protease mutations present in the 6 to 11 year old age group was L90M, associated with broad crossclass resistance, while the most prevalent in the 12 to 18 year old age group was D30N, associated specifically with resistance to NFV only.  Thus, the 6 to 11 year age group appeared to have the most extensive  PI  genotypic  resistance,  and  also  had  the  lowest  antiviral  response  to  fosamprenavir/ ritonavir  therapy  in  APV29005.    In  separate  analyses,  the  number  of  active  NRTI  drugs  in  the regimens was estimated based on both genotype and phenotype scoring (GSS and PSS).  Of the 17 patients  with  fully  active  backbones  (both  GSS  and  PSS  =2),  three  (18%)  experienced  virologic failure.    In  contrast,  five  of  12  patients  (42%)  identified  with  GSS  and  PSS ≤ 2 experienced failure. Thus, as expected, there appeared to be an association between the activity of both the fosamprenavir/ritonavir as well as the background therapy with response.

The  antiviral  responses  observed  in  APV29005  and  APV20003  are  comparable  to  those  with lopinavir/ritonavir  in  the  paediatric  population,  as  shown  in  a  cross-study  comparison.  Such  a comparison has limitations due to differences in study population, differences in baseline susceptibility  to  the  PI  and  the  active  background  regimen.  Noting  these  limitations,  virologic  and immunologic responses observed in APV29005 are comparable to those seen with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lopinavir/ritonavir  liquid  formulation,  which  was  examined  in  100  antiretroviral  therapy-naïve  and experienced patients (aged 6 months to 12 years) in combination with 2 to 3 N(N)RTIs (Saez Llorens, 2003). The similar antiviral and immunologic responses between APV29005 and the lopinavir/ritonavir study were seen despite differences in patient population and study design.

It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  PI  liquid  formulations  in  general  have  a  relatively  poor  taste (Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Antiretroviral  Agents  in  Paediatric  HIV  Infection,  October  2006).    The guidelines also list poor palatability as a disadvantage of other PI liquid formulations (Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Paediatric HIV Infection, October 2006; Sharland M. et al, 2004). The data from questionnaires indicated that in children less than 13 years old, the  most commonly reported issues that could be associated with non-adherence to fosamprenavir were 'Taste, can't get it down, spits up, amount of pills or liquid' (reported by 27% at Week 2) and 'Child refuses' (reported by 24% at Week 2).  However, the reporting of these issues decreased substantially over the course of the study, indicating that children may have become used to the taste of fosamprenavir after repeated administration.

Only  one  patient  was  reported  to  have  discontinued  APV29005  clearly  due  to  palatability  related issues. Four other patients receiving fosamprenavir oral solution discontinued the study due to reasons that  potentially  could  have  been  related  to  palatability.  The  antiviral  response  obtained  by  patients receiving fosamprenavir oral suspension and/or tablets during studies APV20003 and APV29005 is indicative  of  a  relatively  good  level  of  adherence.    If  palatability  were  a  major  obstacle,  a  worse antiviral response and a higher rate of discontinuations would be expected, particularly in the youngest age group where all patients were receiving fosamprenavir oral suspension.

While  the  presented  data  suggest  a  durability  of  the  virologic  response  for  adolescents  (12  to 18 years), they remain currently limited. For PI experienced adolescents, the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir should be guided by current clinically validated resistance algorithms; TDM may be a useful tool to ensure appropriate fosamprenavir exposure in an individual patient. In order to substantiate the current efficacy data in this age group, 8 additional patients will be recruited in Study APV29005 (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

The  paediatric  studies  APV29005  and  APV20002  are  still  ongoing,  actively  enrolling  additional children. Antiviral activity will continue to be monitored in these trials, as well as post-marketing data on the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in HIV infected children gathered (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).  Once  these  data  are  available,  a  further  extension  of  indication  to  include  children below the age of six should be submitted for assessment. In addition, these data will be essential in further substantiating the long-term efficacy of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in children.

## 5 Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Studies APV29005 and APV20003 include so far 20 patients who were 2-5 years of age, 42 patients who were 6-11 years of age and 64 patients who were 12-18 years of age. The majority of patients had more than 48 weeks of exposure. The numbers comprise patients treated with both once and twice a day regimens, so the numbers of patients treated for each individual dosing regimen is small.

Study APV20002 is assessing use of fosamprenavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir in patients less than 2 years  of  age.  Limited  data  has  been  collected  to  date  in  this  study  population.  Further  study  of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in this group of patients is expected.

Safety  was  assessed  by  both  laboratory  and  clinical  evaluations.  Clinical  adverse  events  (AEs)  and laboratory AEs were graded according to the modified Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity grading guidelines. Although 1994 DAIDS guidelines were originally specified in the protocol, laboratory AEs were re-graded according to the 2004 revised guidelines, which were published during the time of the study.

## Adverse events

## Rash

Rash  is  a  known  side  effect  of  therapy  with  fosamprenavir;  rash  occurred  in  9-17%  of  patients  in studies  of  HIV-infected  adults  (APV30002,  APV30003,  ESS100732),  with  drug-related  grade  2-4 rashes  occurring  in  3%  of  patients  in  each  study.  In  studies  of  adults,  rash  has  been  described  as erythematous or maculopapular eruptions (with or without pruritus). Rash occurred in 23/126 (18%) of patients in the paediatric clinical trial programme. Most rash events were grade 1-2 in severity and no patients discontinued treatment due to rash. The cumulative incidence of rash AEs over time shows that rash generally occurred early.

## Gastrointestinal events

In  the  paediatric  clinical  development  programme,  gastrointestinal  events  were  generally  the  most frequently reported AEs, occurring in 72/126 (57%) of patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir. The most  common  gastrointestinal  events  were  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  nausea.  The  majority  of gastrointestinal  events  were  grade  1-2  in  severity  (two  Grade  3-4  events  of  nausea  and  stomach discomfort were reported in the same patient).

Vomiting

34% (all grades), 6% (grade 2-4)

Diarrhoea

22% (all grades), 4% (grade 2-4)

Nausea

16% (all grades), 3% (grade 2-4)

## Laboratory Findings

Hepatobiliary  events  observed  in  these  trials  were  single  cases  of  severe  elevations  in  AST/ALT, bilirubin remained with normal ranges.

Upward  shifts  in  lipid  parameters  were  recorded,  with  a  few  (3  cases)  grade  3  or  higher  toxicity grades.

Glucose did not show clinical significant patterns.

## Neutropenia

Grade 3/4 neutropenia was documented significantly more frequently in patients in APV20003 (13/66, 20%) than in APV29005 (2/53; 4%). The reason for the frequency of neutropenia seen in APV20003 is unclear. Neutropenia has been identified as a potential risk.

## Potential for overdose

Experience  with  fosamprenavir  or  amprenavir  overdose  is  very  limited;  it  is  not  known  whether amprenavir  can  be  removed  by  haemodialysis.  It  is  notable  that  high-dose  fosamprenavir/ritonavir (fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100mg twice daily) is currently being studied in treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in APV102002; analysis of interim data has not revealed safety concerns with this regimen.  The  proposed  product  information  for  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  in  children  is  based  upon weight and age based dosing recommendations, in order to minimise the risk of overdose.

## Potential for off-label paediatric use

Within  the  HIV  indication,  there  is  a  possibility  of  unboosted  fosamprenavir  use  (in  patients  who cannot tolerate ritonavir) or once daily dosing (if compliance is an issue). These regimens have been studied within the paediatric clinical programme and no specific safety concerns have been identified with unboosted or once daily dosing regimens. At present there are currently no dosage recommendations for children aged below the age of 6 years; thus, there is the potential for off-label use in this age group.

## 6 Risk management plan

Pharmacovigilance plan

The MAH declared to having-

- established  processes  for  the  collection  and,  as  required,  notification  of  any  adverse  events occurring anywhere in the world, including the European Union.
- established processes for the regular and systematic review of ongoing safety data relating to its pharmaceutical products.
- permanently and continuously at its disposal the services of a Qualified Person responsible for pharmacovigilance.

The  MAH submitted both  the  summary  of  safety  concerns  and  planned  pharmacovigilance  actions (table 15) as well as the overview of study protocols for the pharmacovigilance plan (table 16).

Risk Minimisation Plan

The MAH stated that no additional concerns with fosamprenavir were identified during the paediatric clinical  development  programme  which  would  necessitate  an  update  to  the  product  information  or additional risk management activities.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety, the PhV System and the RMP

Two  clinical  studies  (APV29005  and  APV20003)  provided  safety  data  on  HIV-infected  children between the age of 2 to 18 years. However, the number of patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in the age group 2 to 5 years is too small to reach a conclusion on the safety profile in this age  group.  For  patients  &lt;  2  years  of  age,  only  very  limited  data  has  been  collected  from  study APV20002. Further data in this age group are awaited; this study so far could therefore not be used in evaluating the safety profile of fosamprenavir in the very young.

Although the key study in this program is APV29005, in which patients received fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily, APV20003 (once daily regimen) provided additional safety data as  it  included  paediatric  patients  from  the  same  age  range  who  achieved  comparable  plasma amprenavir  PK  exposures.    Overall  cumulative  exposure  was  151  patient-years,  and  the  majority (70%) of patients received fosamprenavir/ritonavir for &gt;48 weeks.

With regards to dose level, a substantial proportion of overall exposure to fosamprenavir/ritonavir in Study  APV29005  occurred  at  or  above  the  proposed  recommended  doses:  in  total,  52  of  the  57 patients  (91%)  treated  with  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  APV29005  received  doses  at  or higher than those proposed in the PPK model.

The five most frequently reported AEs, regardless of causality (excluding AEs likely associated with a concurrent illness) included vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, nausea, and rash. Laboratory parameters which were examined were total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, absolute neutrophil count, and  ALT.    Plasma  amprenavir  PK  did  not  generally  correlate  with  observed  AEs  or  the  clinical laboratory parameters tested.

Neutropenia  was  a  potential  new  safety  concern  detected  in  one  of  the  two  paediatric  studies (APV20003). The observed rate of neutropenia in APV20003 was considered to have been specific to that  study  and  to  have  been  at  least  partially  confounded  by  concomitant  medications  and  spurious laboratory results. Nevertheless, neutropenia is considered as a potential risk that will be monitored within the ongoing clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, off-label use of unboosted fosamprenavir (in patients who cannot tolerate ritonavir) is a potential risk.. The MAH has proposed to provide an action plan to address possible off-label use (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

Pharmacological class  effects  of  PIs  observed  in  adults,  gastrointestinal  events,  lipid  abnormalities, AST/ALT elevations and blood glucose elevations should be considered as identified risk also for the paediatric population. Rash is also an identified risk in adults population and in paediatric population.

Overall,  due  to  the  limited  database  on  safety  in  paediatric  patients,  further  experience  with  the fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimen is required, particularly for 2 to 5 year old patients.  Study APV29005 is ongoing, and has been amended to evaluate the proposed dose (fosamprenavir/ritonavir 23/3 mg/kg twice daily) in the 2 to 5 year old age group. In addition, up to 8 patients in the age group of 6 to 18 years will be added to the study, further substantiating the safety profile (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).

In  addition,  the  MAH  is  currently  assessing  the  feasibility  of  using  observational  cohorts  and  drug utilisation  databases  to  provide  information  on  usage  of  fosamprenavir  in  children  within  the  real world population (see also attached Letter of Undertaking). To further characterise the safety profile in paediatrics  post-marketing,  the  MAH  will  perform  quarterly  safety  reviews  and  revert  back  to  a  6monthly PSUR cycle as of the next data lock point.

The MAH has committed to update the RMP in the light of the above identified issues in parallel to the submission of the next PSUR. In this update, the inclusion of the adult population in the EU RMP will be done (see attached Letter of Undertaking).

Taking the above limitations of available data into consideration, the safety profile of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily is acceptable in the added paediatric population of children above the age of six, subject to the pharmacovigilance activities undertaken.

## 7 Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment

Given the availability of Telzir oral suspension, the extension of indication to include the treatment of paediatric  patients  is  of  interest,  especially  in  view  of  the  limited  available  boosted  PI  regimens available in this population in contrast to adult patients.

In the target population Telzir is expected to be a preferable option as compared to the current oral solution  formulation  of  amprenavir  with  regards  to  the  excipients  content  (lower  propylene  glycol concentration) and the higher concentration of active, allowing the administration of lower volumes.

## Pharmacokinetics

The dose recommendation derived from the PPK model for children above the age of six is in line with the doses used in study APV29005 for this age group. The fact that for 12 to 18 year olds, the predicted  geometric  mean  AUC(0τ )  and  Cmin  values  were  approximately  20%  lower  than  the targeted adult exposure in the PPK model are to some extent balanced by the efficacy data for this age group.  Nevertheless,  this  positive  clinical  outcome  needs  to  be  further  substantiated  in  the  ongoing studies. Concerns, however, remain with the age group of children below the age of six.

The fact that in study APV20002 (very young children of 6 to 24 months of age) no sufficient plasma levels could be achieved even after administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir doses up to 4.5-fold the adult ones raises major concerns.  This may not only be explained by the relatively higher CL in this age group, but may also be due to an insufficient absorption of the oral solution, possibly because of a short gastrointestinal transit time in small children, or because of frequent vomiting and diarrhoea in HIV-infected children.  The  MAH should further research the underlying cause of this effect  in  the ongoing study. In addition, theses findings were reflected in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy

Overall,  the  clinical  efficacy  data  submitted  in  support  of  this  type  II  variation  are  limited.  Those derived from study APV29005, which evaluated the efficacy of the recommended fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  regimen  when  used  in  combination  with  two  NRTIs  are  only supportive for the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in paediatric patients above the age of six,  due  to  the  lack  of  children  evaluated  for  the  lower  age  group.  In  the  supported  age  group, however, both antiviral and immunological responses were acceptable.

The observed variability in antiviral response was most likely due to differences in underlying baseline viral resistance or treatment experience of each individual patient. The antiviral responses observed in APV29005  and  APV20003  are  comparable  to  those  with  lopinavir/ritonavir  in  the  paediatric population, as shown in a cross-study comparison. The similar antiviral and immunologic responses between  APV29005  and  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  study  were  seen  despite  differences  in  the  patient populations and in the study designs.

The  antiviral  response  obtained  by  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir  oral  suspension  and/or  tablets during studies APV20003 and APV29005 is indicative of a relatively good level of adherence, even though palatability is a common problem in antiretroviral therapy with oral solutions.

While  the  presented  data  suggest  a  durability  of  the  virologic  response  for  adolescents  (12  to  18 years), they remain limited. For PI experienced adolescents, the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir should be guided by current clinically validated resistance algorithms; TDM may be a useful tool to ensure appropriate fosamprenavir exposure in an individual patient. Efficacy of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in all age groups will further be evaluated in the ongoing clinical trials.

## Clinical safety

Two  clinical  studies  (APV29005  and  APV20003)  provided  safety  data  on  HIV-infected  children between  the  age  of  2  to  18  years.  However,  in  the  age  group  2  to  5  years  the  number  of  patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily is too small to reach a conclusion on the safety profile in this  age  group.  For  patients  &lt;2  years  of  age,  only  very  limited  data  has  been  collected  from  study APV20002. Further data in this age group are awaited; this study so far could therefore not be used in evaluating the safety profile of fosamprenavir in the very young.

Neutropenia  was  a  potential  new  safety  concern  detected  in  one  of  the  two  paediatric  studies (APV20003).  However,  this  signal  may  have  been  at  least  partially  confounded.  Neutropenia  is considered  as  a  potential  risk  that  will  be  monitored  within  the  ongoing  clinical  studies  and  postmarketing surveillance.

In  addition,  off-label  use  of  unboosted  fosamprenavir  is  a  potential  identified  risk  (in  patients  who cannot tolerate ritonavir).

Overall,  due  to  the  limited  database  on  safety  in  paediatric  patients,  further  experience  with  the fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimen is required, particularly for 2 to 5 year old patients.  Study APV29005 is ongoing, and has been amended to evaluate the proposed dose (fosamprenavir/ritonavir 23/3 mg/kg twice daily) in the 2 to 5 year old age group. In addition, up to 8 patients in the age group of 6 to 18 years will be added to the study, further substantiating the safety profile.

In  addition,  the  MAH  is  currently  assessing  the  feasibility  of  using  observational  cohorts  and  drug utilisation  databases  to  provide  information  on  usage  of  fosamprenavir  in  children  within  the  real world population (see also attached letter of undertaking). To further characterise the safety profile in paediatrics  post-marketing,  the  MAH  will  perform  quarterly  safety  reviews  and  revert  back  to  a  6montly PSUR cycle as of the next data lock point.

The MAH has committed to update the RMP in the light of the above identified issues in parallel to the submission of the next PSUR. In this update, the inclusion of the adult population in the EU RMP will be done (see attached Letter of Undertaking).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Taking the above limitations of available data into consideration, the safety profile of fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily is acceptable in the added paediatric population of children above the age of six, subject to the pharmacovigilance activities undertaken.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Overall, the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data provided within this variation application are adequate to support the extension of indication to include the children and adolescents between the ages of 6 to 18 years. This is founded in the validity of the dose recommendation, the durability of the virologic and immunologic response and the safety profile for this age group.

In the light of the above, the CHMP considered the benefit/risk balance for the extension of indication of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to include children and adolescents of the age of six years or above to be positive.

## 8 Product information

Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  initial  (see  attachment  8)  and  additional  proposals  of  the  MAH  to amend the Product Information and in the light of the assessment of the submitted data, the CHMP requested the following amendments in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Annex II and Package Leaflet (PL). The MAH was in agreement with this and withdrew the request for an extension of indication below the age of six years.

The MAH's initial proposed changes to section 4.1 were discussed and not agreeable by the CHMP. Telzir  oral  suspension  should  be  indicated  in  children  and  adolescents  above  the  age  of  six  years, mainly due to  the  fact  that  for  the  paediatric  population  below  the  age  of  six  pharmacokinetic  and efficacy data as well as long-term safety experience is limited.

## Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration'

The MAH's initial proposal was amended to reflect the fact that the extension of indication was only agreed for children above the age of six years. In addition, a warning about the lack of data in the younger children was added, together with a cross-reference to section 5.2.

## Section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects'

The adverse event profile in children and adolescents was updated based on the integrated safety data from studies APV29005 and APV20003. The initial proposal by the MAH to add warnings about the non-recommendation of the once-daily regimen was deleted as this is duly reflected in section 4.2.

## Section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties'

Results of study APV29005 are presented. The initial proposal by the MAH to reflect all age groups was not agreed, and the data was recalculated to represent only the results obtained in the newly added paediatric  population.  As  APV20003  employed  the  once  daily  regimen,  the  initially  proposed  full description of its results was reduced.

## Section 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties'

Pharmacokinetic results of study APV29005 are reflected for the relevant age group. In addition, upon request  by  the  CHMP,  the  findings  of  study  APV20002  are  shortly  given,  i.e.  that  even  with  dose increases  up  to  4.75  fold  no  satisfactory  plasma  exposure  in  this  age  group  was  achieved.  This information  was  thought  to  be  pertinent  in  order to further discourage  the  off-label use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in this age group.

## Section 5.3 'Preclinical safety data'

As the nature of hyaline droplets in the kidneys of juvenile rats had been clarified to be α 2µ globulin within a post-authorisation commitment, the relevance of the renal findings in juvenile animals during the assessment of the initial MA was addressed as such: 'Toxicity was not aggravated when juvenile animals  were  treated  as  compared  with  adult  animals,  but  the  data  did  indicate  a  steeper  dose response.'

## PL

The PL was updated in accordance to the changes proposed to the SPC. The CHMP agreed with the MAH proposed wording.

## Annex II

Annex II was updated to include the conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of fosamprenavir.

The MAH agreed with the above amendments and submitted a revised Product Information.
