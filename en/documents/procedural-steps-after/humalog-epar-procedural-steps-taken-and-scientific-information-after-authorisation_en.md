1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| WS/0105 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Further to a CHMP request based on the recommendations from PhVWP, the Product Information (Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated by adding a warning on an increased incidence of heart failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors. In addition to the above the MAH took the opportunity to update annex IIB \"Other conditions\" for Liprolog with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance system. | 17/02/2011 | 24/03/2011 | SmPC and PL | The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. After the review of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin containing products should include warning on increased cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. |

Details of local representatives were updated in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet                                                                                    |            |            |             | January 1983 - 28 February 2005. No suspected interaction with an angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) was reported. However, the review of the safety database showed a slight increased frequency of hypoglycaemic events in patients receiving an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an ARB as concomitant medication, which supports a possible interaction with insulin. Although the overall number of reports is lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors, the reporting rate appears to be the same. Although the mechanism of the interaction is not well understood, both types of medicinal products share the similar endpoint to decrease the effect of angiotensin II and thus, both have the potential to increase insulin sensitivity. A published clinical study comparing the effects of an ACEI and an ARB showed more pronounced effects of the ACE inhibitors on endothelial function but similar effects on insulin sensitivity (Am J Hypertens. 2005 Feb;18(2 Pt 1):178-82) and thus support the data from the MAH safety database. Therefore section 4.5 of the SPC was updated to include ARBs in the list of medicinal products that may reduce insulin requirements.   |

| II/0062 | This variation refers to an update of section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to add clinical efficacy information based on the results of two phase IV clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 27/07/2006 | 01/09/2006 | SmPC     | The MAHprovided the results of two randomized, open-label, crossover studies investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of twice-daily insulin lispro LM plus metformin and once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin on overall glycaemic control, as measured by %HbA1c. Patients who participated in these studies had type 2 diabetes with inadequately controlled blood glucose, either on one or more oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications only (study IOND, N=74), or on one or more oral anti-hyperglycaemic plus one daily injection of insulin or a conventional insulin regimen consisting of once- or twice-daily NPH insulin (study IOMX, N=93). Results showed that twice-daily insulin lispro LM in combination with metformin has a greater HbA1c-lowering effect than once-daily insulin glargine with metformin, as expressed in mean %HbA1c thereafter. The new data were reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC, including those obtained |
