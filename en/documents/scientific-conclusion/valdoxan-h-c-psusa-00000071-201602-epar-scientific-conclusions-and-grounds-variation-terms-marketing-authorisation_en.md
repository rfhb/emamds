## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for agomelatine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Hepatotoxicity is the major safety concern with agomelatine. The available data does not allow concluding that patients with a medical history of alcohol use disorder has a higher risk of developing a serious transaminase increase induced by agomelatine. However, despite the current warnings in the SmPC, agomelatine continues to be prescribed to a substantial number of patients with alcohol use disorders (approaching 10% of patients in the cohort study). To further address this risk the warning in section 4.4 has been rephrased.

The MAH has updated frequencies of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) based on updated pooled clinical trial data (placebo-controlled and active-controlled clinical trials).

Based two published case reports of akatisia linked to agomelatine intake, akathisia has also been added as a rare adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSURs, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing agomelatine were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for agomelatine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing agomelatine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
