The paediatric indication in children aged 4 to 18 years has also been deleted based on the fact that treatment could no longer be attained with the remaining dosage forms of 200 mg and 400 mg capsules. Taking into consideration that there are alternatives available for children within the class of protease inhibitors the changes proposed to the product information were considered appropriate.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit risk profile of Crixivan continues to be favourable. There is no evident new safety signal of concern from the review in the 3rd Renewal application of Crixivan. Although no new safety concerns has been indicated in the pediatric population from the data submitted, the product information has been revised in order to adequately reflect the substantially higher risk of nephrolithiasis in children compared with adults (approximately 30% in children versus 12.4% in adults). Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been revised accordingly.

The CHMP is of the opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity.

The product information has also been updated to be in line with the current QRD template and SmPC guideline. The list of local representatives in the package leaflet has been revised to amend contact details for all representatives.

addition to UGT1A1 inhibition, indinavir has also been demonstrated to inhibit an organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1), a hepatic uptake transporter for bilirubin, which provides an additional potential mechanism for indinavir-induced hyperbilirubinemia. Use of atazanavir is also associated with reversible indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia related to inhibition of UGT. Although the combinations of indinavir and atazanavir with or without ritonavir have not been studied the co-administration of these medicinal products is not recommended due to risk of worsening of hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, the full section 4.8 has been revised in line with the recommendations of the Guideline in force on Summary of Product Characteristics including a summary of safety profile, a tabulated summary of adverse reactions reported with indinavir, a description of selected adverse reactions and a description of events reported in paediatric patients.

The MAH updated its DDPS and submitted therefore this type II variation. The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance System as described by the MAH fulfils the requirements and is considered acceptable.

In 2005 an interaction study on saquinavir boosted with ritonavir together with rifampicin in healthy volunteers had

reasoning on their metabolic pathways. The PL was updated accordingly. The MAH also revised the full section 4.8 as requested by the CHMP to bring it in line with the latest version in force of the Guideline on SmPC.

to be prematurely discontinued due to an increased risk of hepatotoxicity associated with this co-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not fully elucidated. It has been hypothesised that the predominant effect between the inducer effect of rifampicin and the inhibitor effect of the boosted protease inhibitors might depend on the boosted protease inhibitor involved. Lacking the results of specific interaction studies, the CHMP concluded as a conservative measure to reinforce the contraindication with rifampicin in section 4.4 and improve the guidance provided to physicians regarding the interaction of boosted protease inhibitors with rifampicin in section 4.5.

In a pharmacokinetic study, co-administration of rosuvastatin (20 mg) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/ 100 mg) in healthy volunteers resulted in a 2.1 and 4.7-fold increase in rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax respectively. The exact mechanism of interaction behind this significant increase of rosuvastatin exposure is unknown. In view of these results, concomitant use of rosuvastatin with protease inhibitors  (PIs) is not recommended. The limited pharmacokinetic data that is available on the interactions between PIs and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are not metabolised by cytochrome CYP3A4 do not allow for predictions to be made as to the effects of a given individual PI on an individual statin. Based on literature data, there is evidence that pravastatin and fluvastatin are substrates of transport proteins; thus an interaction between these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and indinavir via effect in May 2008 on the combination of rifampicin with indinavir given with concomitant low-dose ritonavir.

should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL are updated with this information.

Based upon the review of cases reported in clinical trials and in the post-authorisation setting, the Undesirable events section was updated with the addition of the term \"renal failure\".

The section 4 \"Possible side effects\" of the PL was updated accordingly with the inclusion of \"loss of renal function\".

In addition, duplicate information from section 4 of the PL was deleted, the term \"container\" was replaced by \"bottle\" in the section 5 of the PL and the Maltese local representative contact was updated.

The section on contraindications was updated to include amiodarone as a medicine that must not be coadministered with indinavir. The coadministration of amiodarone with indinavir is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. This is based on the fact that both agents share the CYP3A4 mediated metabolic pathway and therefore co-administration could lead to overexposure of amiodarone and/or indinavir. Additionally as amiodarone is a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic index, such blood plasma concentration elevations could lead to possibly fatal

Update of section 4.8 of the SPC based on a cumulative safety review of the post-marketing experience to include the term \"renal failure\". The PL was updated accordingly.

Cases of osteonecrosis (death of the bone tissue resulting from an insufficient blood supply) have been reported in HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although the cause of this disease could be due to multiple factors (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease and/or in patients with long term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all available data the CHMP agreed that this information should now be included in the SPC and PL of all antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement. longer   |

Crixivan is no longer a drug of choice for first line HIV-therapy. Therefore, considering the remaining safety concerns that the MAH has committed to address in connection with future PSURs (i.e cumulative reviews of post-marketing data with regard to renal impairment and the risk for QT-prolongation), and the uncertainty of the place of indinavir in the future management of HIV-1 infected patients, the CHMP recommended that the renewal is limited to five years. Finally, the CHMP recommended that the annual PSURs should be submitted for at least three years.   |

opportunistic infection has not been detected/ diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to the institution of CART, the treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually given priority. In particular, this is true for the complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  An additional reason for treating the OI and the HIV-infection sequentially is the great risk of adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug interactions.

The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory reaction is considering to be important for the clinical handling of the patients. Therefore, further to the assessment of the MAH's responses and discussions held at the Pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, the CHMP adopted a class labelling text regarding the reactivation of the immune system of HIV-infected patients treated with any type of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) to be implemented in the product information of all anti-retroviral medicinal products.
