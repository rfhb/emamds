· During the meeting on 22 January 2015, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation to DUTREBIS. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and leads to a depletion of immune cells (CD4 + cells). As the CD4-positive cells are depleted, the host becomes increasingly susceptible to a variety of opportunistic pathogens and immune deficiency related diseases. In the absence of treatment, most infected individuals succumb to HIV-related disease. Many infected patients have been successfully treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). The goal of HAART is to suppress HIV to undetectable levels so that immune function is preserved or restored. HIV infection in adults and children is a worldwide problem, both in developed and in developing countries. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated the number of people living with HIV globally in 2012 was about 35.3 million. The number of people living with HIV has continued to increase as more patients are receiving antiretroviral therapy and living longer lives. While the number of people living with HIV has increased over the years, the number of new infections and deaths has decreased due to increased education and prevention efforts, increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and effective prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women and infected infants. In 2012, there were approximately 2.3 million new infections, a decrease of approximately 33% from 2001, and 1.6 million people died from AIDS-related illnesses, a decrease from 2.3 million in 2005. The use of antiretroviral agents for treatment and prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding has reduced the rate of HIV transmission from mother to child. The annual number of newly infected children in 2012 was approximately 260,000 in low- and middle-income countries, 35% lower than in 2009. One of the major factors related to the success of antiretroviral regimens is adherence.  Drug adherence is directly related to clinical and virologic outcomes. High rates of drug adherence are associated with improved viral and clinical responses, durability of response and minimization of the emergence of drug resistance. There are many factors which negatively impact adherence in both the adult and paediatric populations. Among them are high pill burden or liquid volume, frequent dosing requirement, complexity of dosing regimens, dietary restriction and side effects. Fixed-dose combinations of antiretroviral agents, such as the proposed combination of lamivudine and raltegravir with its favourable safety and tolerability profile, have been developed to address the issues of pill burden and complexity of dosing regimens. In addition, the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet does not have dietary restrictions with regards to dosing, which should aid in adherence. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of lamivudine (150 mg) and raltegravir (300 mg) to be administered twice daily (BID) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet has been developed for an indication in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced) in adults, adolescents, and paediatric patients.

Raltegravir (MK-0518, Isentress) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) that is active against HIV-1. It is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, adolescents, and children from the age of 2 years. The approved oral dose for the poloxamer FCT is 400 mg twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral therapies in adults, adolescents 12 years of age and older, and children 6 through 11 years of age weighing at least 25 kg.  A chewable tablet is approved for use in combination with other antiretroviral therapies in children 2 to 11 years of age; dosing is weight based to a maximum dose of 300 mg twice daily. Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that consists of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. It is indicated as part of antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults and children.  The recommended oral dose of lamivudine in HIV-infected adults and adolescents &gt;12 years of age is 300 mg daily, administered as either 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg once daily. The recommended oral dose of lamivudine in HIV-infected children under 12 years of age weighing at least 30 kg is 150 mg twice daily. The recommended dose in children 3 months to less than 12 years of age weighing less than 30 kg is weight based using tablets or oral solution; in these patients, weight-based dosing is administered twice daily. The lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet improves the dosing regimen by reducing the daily pill burden as compared to dosing with the individual agents. This two-drug ART combination allows the flexibility to choose additional agents to design a complete treatment regimen. In addition, it offers a FDC with a newer class of antiretroviral agents, an InSTI, and specifically does not require a boosting agent such as ritonavir or cobicistat. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1.

## Lamivudine

## General information

The chemical name of lamivudine is 4-amino-1-[(2 R ,5 S )-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]pyrimidin-2(1 H )-one hydrate (5:1) and has the following structure: The structure of lamivudine was inferred from the method synthesis and confirmed by  1 H and  13 C NMR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry. Lamivudine is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline solid. It is freely soluble in water, soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in isopropyl acetate. Lamivudine is chiral and possesses two stereogenic centres. One originates in the starting material, having been introduced by a chiral auxiliary approach, whilst the second is introduced under substrate control during the manufacturing process. Stereoisomers are controlled in an isolated intermediate and in the active substance specification by HPLC (diastereomer) and chiral HPLC (enantiomer). Multiple solvated and hydrated polymorphic forms are known. The chosen commercial form is a 0.2 hydrate, controlled by the water content and temperature of the crystallisation solvent. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls Lamivudine is synthesized by a single manufacturer in three main steps using two well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. During the procedure, a major objection was raised on the initially proposed starting material, which was resolved when the applicant re-defined it to two upstream precursors. One starting material is a mixture of two diastereomers which is of no consequence as the chiral centre in question is destroyed in a subsequent step. Stereochemistry is introduced selectively through a chiral auxiliary approach, originating in a chiral pool material. Enantio-and diastereomeric impurities are limited in specifications of isolated intermediates and the active substance but no limits are set in the chiral starting material. The applicant will attempt to synthesize its stereoisomers following authorisation in order to set specifications if required. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been identified for stages 2 and 3 of the process which are carefully controlled in order to limit formation of impurities and ensure production of the correct polymorphic form of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lamivudine. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis to ensure each successive reaction generates product of adequate quality. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities, including those listed in the Ph. Eur. monograph, were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and UV absorbance (UV at 440 nm). The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph for anhydrous lamivudine. Batch analysis data on five commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Analytical data on all other batches made throughout development from pilot to commercial scale and used for development, clinical and stability studies were also provided as supporting information. Stability Stability data on six commercial scale batches of lamivudine from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, salicylic acid assay, impurities, water content, x-ray diffraction pattern, chiral purity, and identity by IR. No significant changes were observed for any of the parameters tested. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Lamivudine was also tested under stressed conditions (HCl, NaOH, H2O2, heat) and results demonstrate that the analytical method is stability indicating. The active substance is stable to acid, base, heat and light, whilst several new impurities are formed on exposure to peroxide. The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. Raltegravir General information The chemical name of raltegravir is N -[(4-Fluorophenyl)methyl]-1,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[1-methyl-1-[[(5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-y l)carbonyl]amino]ethyl]-6-oxo-4-pyrimidinecarboxamide monopotassium salt and has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Molecular Formula:   C20H20FKN6O5 Molecular Mass:   482.51 g/mole The structure of raltegravir was inferred from the method synthesis and confirmed by  1 H and  13 C NMR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray crystallography. Raltegravir is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline solid. It is soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in acetonitrile and insoluble in isopropyl alcohol. Raltegravir is achiral, possessing no chiral centres. Three polymorphic forms of the potassium salt have been identified which are readily distinguished by XRPD patterns. The chosen commercial form is thermodynamically stable with respect to inter-form conversion and controlled by the crystallisation process. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls Raltegrair potassium is manufactured using exactly the same process as for the same active substance registered in the Isentress dossier with an additional milling step to reduce particle size. It is synthesized in 3 main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Careful control of temperature in step 1 is essential to minimising key impurities, whilst control of reagent stoichiometry in step 2 ensures active substance quality. The final step is a milling process which ensures the particle size requirements of the product formulation are met. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. There are no new impurities as compared with the Isentress dossier as a result of the additional milling step. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Specification The active substance specification includes the same tests as those registered in the Isentress dossier which consists of tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (IR, potassium flame test), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF) as well as an additional test for particle size (laser diffraction).

Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set, in-line with the Isentress dossier. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Batch analysis data on four pilot and commercial scale batches of raltegravir potassium are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Raltegravir potassium is a BCS II compound with high permeability but poor solubility in physiological media. It is milled to a smaller particle size than in Isentress, which results in faster dissolution, higher bioavailability and increased tensile strength in the Dutebris formulation. Because of the known stability of raltegravir in fluid bed granulation processes, a high shear wet granulation procedure was investigated in order to improve scalability, increase relative raltegravir composition in the tablet and afford suitable mechanical properties. Partial protonation of raltegravir potassium occurs during formulation but this is limited to an acceptable level in the final process. Lamivudine is a BCS I compound exhibiting high permeability and high solubility in physiologically relevant media. A high relative drug loading was required in tablets order to meet the QTPP, but lamivudine exhibits poor flow properties for formulation. Therefore, a roller compaction process was developed in order to improve flow properties and allow for granules with high drug content. Inclusion of lactose and colloidal silicon

Stability Stability of milled raltegravir potassium was compared with that of un-milled raltegravir potassium registered in the Isentress dossier. Stability data on six commercial scale batches of milled raltegravir potassium from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, water content, assay, impurities and particle size distribution. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. There were no trends to any of the measured parameters. The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The objective was to develop an immediate release orally available formulation containing a fixed dose combination of raltegravir and lamivudine meeting the quality target product profile (QTPP). The QTPP was defined as a twice-daily single film-coated tablet with adequate shelf-life and purity, weighing less than a defined target to ensure patient compliance, containing both active substances and offering equivalent or better pharmacokinetic properties to the equivalent individually co-dosed standalone products. As a result of this, the critical quality attributes were identified as assay, content uniformity, degradation products, dissolution, moisture content, and appearance. Isentress tablets dissolve via an erosion mechanism which could potentially impact the pharmacokinetic profile of  lamivudine  relative  to  Epivir,  were  it  to  be  included  in  the  same  formulation.  Monolithic  and  bi-layer formulations  were  sought  in  order  to  speed  up  tablet  erosion  relative  to  Isentress,  whilst  maintaining  a pharmacokinetic  profile  for  lamivudine  similar  to  Epivir.  To  achieve  these  goals,  development  of  separate granulation procedures for each active substance was investigated. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dioxide as flow aids resulted in higher bulk density and better flow properties but did not significantly impact on dissolution rate, thus allowing the QTPP to be met.

Combination of the two granule types into a monolithic tablet was then optimised by varying extra-granular excipient content in order to meet the desired overall tablet weight whilst maintaining the desired dissolution rates and bioavailabilities of the individual active substances and achieving desired mechanical properties. Raltegravir is more bioavailable in this formulation than it was in Isentress and the dose was reduced to 300 mg accordingly. The dissolution of lamivudine is slowed down somewhat relative to Epivir due to the erosion-based mechanism but it still dissolves fully within 45 minutes. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The formulation used during clinical studies and for the biobatch is the same as that intended for marketing. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method to detect differences in tablet quality resulting from relevant deviations in the manufacturing process has been demonstrated. The primary packaging is a high density polyethylene bottle with child-resistant closure and a dessicant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: high shear wet granulation of raltegravir potassium, roller compaction of lamivudine, blending of the two granule types with additional excipients, compression to form tablets and film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. In order to develop a robust manufacturing process, a risk assessment was carried out on the major unit operations described above. Subsequent process development focused on those unit operations most likely to impact on finished product CQAs. A critical process parameter was identified for one step of the manufacturing process during these studies. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs), normal operating ranges (NORs), and target set-points have been defined for the following steps: granulation of raltegravir potassium, granulation of lamivudine, blending, compression and film-coating. The applicant commits to formal validation of the manufacturing process prior to commercial distribution. A validation protocol has been provided and is considered acceptable, given the standard manufacturing process. The in-process controls are adequate for the production of film-coated tablets. Product specification The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (both active substances - HPLC, TLC and NIR), assay (for both active substances - HPLC), degradation products (from both active substances - HPLC), content uniformity (both active substances - HPLC), dissolution (both active substances - Ph. Eur.) and water content (KF). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Batch analysis results are provided for 4 production scale batches used for clinical and stability studies confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data of three pilot scale batches of finished product manufactured using the proposed manufacturing process by the proposed manufacturer but at a different site, stored under long term conditions for 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data on an additional full production scale batch manufactured at the proposed site by the proposed manufacturer stored under long term conditions for 9 months under long term conditions and for 6 months under accelerated conditions are also provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for marketing and were stored in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, assay (both active substances), degradation products (from both active substances), water content, dissolution and microbial content. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant change to any of the parameters measured was observed under either long term or accelerated conditions. In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant change to any of the parameters was observed. An in-use stability study was conducted to simulate patient opening and closing of the bottle over 60 days. No significant changes to any parameters, other than an increase in moisture content, were observed. This was shown not to impact and CQAs, and thus, the bottle and desiccant are considered to provide adequate protection from moisture during patient use. Stability data on bulk tablets stored at 30 o C / 75% RH for 9 months was also provided and considered adequate to support a 12 month holding time for bulk tablets. The applicant confirmed that shelf-life stability will be measured from the start of the manufacturing process. The applicant will continue all on-going stability studies up to shelf-life, initiate stability studies on the first 3 commercial batches, and carry out additional stability studies on further commercial batches on an annual basis. Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. Adventitious agents It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing process. PARs have been defined for unit operations within the main manufacturing steps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: The applicant should attempt to synthesize stereoisomers of the chiral starting material used for synthesis of lamivudine following authorisation in order to set specifications for stereoisomeric impurities if deemed necessary. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction Lamivudine and raltegravir are two potent, well tolerated antiretroviral agents that are commonly prescribed together in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The fixed dose combination (FDC) formulation of these medications provides a simplified dosing regimen that will provide a convenient backbone for antiretroviral therapy regimens and will allow flexibility in the choice of additional agents and could improve patient compliance and satisfaction. No combination safety assessment studies have been conducted with lamivudine and raltegravir. This is in accordance with the ICH M3(R2) guideline that indicates for combinations involving two marketed entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies 'would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing'. No significant toxicological concerns have been identified concerning lamivudine and raltegravir co-administration. The strategy not to conduct nonclinical studies with co-administration of raltegravir and lamivudine was endorsed in the EU via Scientific Advice dated April 19, 2012 [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/225292/2012]. Comprehensive nonclinical testing programs for lamivudine and raltegravir, evaluated as individual agents, have been conducted to support their marketing authorisation. A brief summary of existing nonclinical toxicology data for lamivudine and raltegravir was provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

No new nonclinical pharmacology studies were conducted to support this application. Based on available data, no relevant adverse pharmacological or virological interactions are expected.

2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics No new nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to support the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. Based on available data, a pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and raltegravir is not expected. Both lamivudine and raltegravir have in general low propensity for clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other co-administered drugs. 2.3.4. Toxicology No combination safety assessment studies have been conducted with lamivudine and raltegravir. An extensive number of nonclinical toxicity studies, previously conducted for each agent individually and submitted in support of their respective original marketing authorisation applications, were also reviewed in support of this application. In brief, the individual safety assessment programs supporting raltegravir and lamivudine clinical use included safety pharmacology studies, acute and repeated dose oral studies, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, a battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies and rodent carcinogenicity studies. All pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Nonclinical Testing Guidelines and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. The rat and dog were chosen as the nonclinical toxicology species for both lamivudine and raltegravir development. Repeat dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity studies with lamivudine and raltegravir were both conducted for up to 6 months in rats and 12 months in dogs. Developmental and reproductive toxicity was determined in rats and rabbits, and an assessment of carcinogenicity conducted in mice and rats. All pivotal studies were supported by toxicokinetic measurements. Lamivudine has been shown to have low acute toxicity in rodents. Safety pharmacology studies with lamivudine showed no major effects on cardiovascular or respiratory parameters. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In repeated dose rat studies, lamivudine was adequately tolerated up to 2000 mg∙kg-1 bid for 6 months, with a 450 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 dose identified as the no-observed effect level (AUC exposure at this dose was reviewed to be 17-fold higher than the lamivudine human therapeutic AUC). Treatment-related effects at doses &gt;450 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 included minor haematological (mainly red cell parameters), clinical chemistry and urinalysis changes, and mucosal hyperplasia of the cecum. In dogs, lamivudine doses of 1500 mg∙kg-1 bid in males and 1000 mg∙kg-1 bid in females for a period of 12 months were adequately tolerated. A dose of lamivudine of 45 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 was identified as a no-observed effect level (NOEL) and AUC exposure at this dose was determined to be 9-fold higher than the lamivudine human therapeutic AUC. Treatment-related changes at doses &gt;45 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 were restricted to reductions in red cell counts with increased mean corpuscular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

volume and haemoglobin and reductions in total lymphocyte counts in high dose animals, but with no effect on bone marrow cytology. Lamivudine showed no evidence of impaired fertility and no effect on the survival, growth, and development to weaning of the offspring. The compound also showed no teratogenic potential in rat or rabbit and peri-post natal studies in rats did not reveal any cause of concern. In juvenile toxicity studies with lamivudine, mild microcytic anaemia was observed, similar to findings observed in adult animals in repeat dose studies. In addition, lower testis weight was observed in animals treated with 2000 mg∙kg-1∙day-1, corresponding to slight to moderate dilation of the seminiferous tubules. Testicular findings were not observed in adult animals, suggesting that the effect is related to testicular immaturity/developing status. The exposure safety margin for this finding when compared to the lamivudine human therapeutic exposure was &gt; 80. While no evidence of mutagenicity in vitro or chromosomal damage in rats in vivo was observed, lamivudine reportedly induced gene mutations in the mouse lymphoma assay (at ≥1000 μg∙ml-1), and was clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenicity test in human lymphocytes (at 300 μg∙ml-1, 150 times higher than exposures associated with clinical use). Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times (mice) and 58 times (rats) the lamivudine human therapeutic exposure. The nonclinical safety evaluation of raltegravir also demonstrated that this compound was well-tolerated. Raltegravir has a low acute toxicity in rodents. No cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system effects were observed with raltegravir in safety pharmacology studies. In the repeat-dose toxicity dog studies, no significant toxicities were identified when tested up to a plateau of exposure after oral dosing (chronic dose of 360 mg∙kg-1∙day-1), resulting in a safety margin of approximately 9-fold based on AUC values relative to the therapeutic raltegravir exposure. In rat toxicity studies, no toxicity relevant to human risk was identified, with mortality and post-mortem findings observed attributed to gastrointestinal disturbance related to the large bulk dosed nonclinical formulation dose volume and/or direct irritating properties of the compound. Findings that were considered local and related to raltegravir irritation of the stomach mucosa were observed at a dose of 120 mg∙kg-1∙day-1, which provided an exposure margin of &gt;1.6-fold above the expected therapeutic raltegravir exposure in patients. Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Raltegravir was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at or slightly above the therapeutic AUC exposure. A slight increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs was observed in the embryofetal rat toxicity study at the highest dose tested, the maximum feasible oral dose of 600 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 (a dose that was not tolerated in longer duration repeat-dose adult toxicity studies). There were no external or visceral abnormalities and no other foetal or postnatal developmental effects at this or any other dose in either rats or rabbits. No new toxicity profile, increased sensitivity to toxicity, or specific hazard was identified in juvenile animal studies with raltegravir. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Raltegravir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays in bacteria and mammalian cells or in vivo studies in mice.

Raltegravir demonstrated a lack of carcinogenic potential when assessed in two year rat and mouse studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment was not included with this application a justification was provided. The justification provided was considered acceptable as no significant increase in environmental exposure was expected to occur.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects No nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic or safety assessment studies have been conducted with the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. Based on the nonclinical data presented in the original marketing authorisation applications of the individual agents, there appears to be no significant potential for adverse pharmacodynamic interactions between the two components. Pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and raltegravir is also not expected and both lamivudine and raltegravir have in general low propensity for clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other co-administered drugs. An extensive number of nonclinical toxicity studies, previously conducted for each of the agents individually to support their respective original marketing authorisation applications. No significant toxicological finding was identified for either compound that would indicate a concern for lamivudine and raltegravir co-administration. The CHMP agreed that that no significant increase of these compounds in the environment is expected to occur. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects There are no particular concerns to highlight. Both raltegravir and lamivudine are authorised in the Union and marketed for many years. In general, both raltegravir and lamivudine were well-tolerated in non-clinical studies, with margins of safety identified and/or lack of toxicological relevance to humans determined. No significant toxicological concerns were identified. Neither agent was shown to be a specific hazard with regard to developmental or reproductive toxicity, nor was either agent demonstrated to have carcinogenic potential. The applicant has demonstrated that no significant increase of these compounds in the environment is expected to occur. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction The goal of the development program was to evaluate the relative BA/BE of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet with respect to the reference products, Epivir (3TC) and Isentress FCT in order to bridge the efficacy and safety of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet to that of the individual reference products. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet have been evaluated in eight Phase I studies, including three prototype biocomparison (BC) studies (P089, P196, and P269), three final market image (FMI) relative BA/BE studies (P253, P258, and P260, one each for the US, EU, and Canada, respectively, using locally-sourced lamivudine), one FMI food effect study (P254), and one drug-drug interaction study (P214).

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Prototype Bio-comparison Studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study P089:

This was a 2-part, randomised, open-label, single dose crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and lamivudine after administration of single oral prototype formulations (monolithic and bilayer) of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in healthy adult male and female subjects. Thirty-five (35) subjects were randomized to either Part I or Part II. In Part I, 20 subjects received single doses of raltegravir and lamivudine over 5 treatment periods as either co-administration of individual reference products (Isentress and Epivir) or prototype FDC formulations to evaluate potential formulations for once-daily dosing. In Part II, 15 subjects received single doses of raltegravir and lamivudine over 5 treatment periods as either co-administration of individual reference products (Isentress and Epivir) or FDC formulations of lamivudine/raltegravir as monolithic FDC tablets (150 mg/400 mg; 150 mg/200 mg) or as bilayer FDC tablets (150 mg/400 mg) to evaluate potential formulations for BID dosing. There was at least a 5-day washout interval between all treatments in both Parts. All study drugs were administered in the fasted state, except for Part I Period 5 in which the study was administered after a high fat meal. The geometric mean pharmacokinetic parameter values for the FDC (MK-0518B) probe formulations were estimated and compared to the corresponding values for the respective RAL poloxamer and LAM co-administration in each part, all following single dose administration in the fasted state. Part I of the study evaluated potential formulations for once-daily dosing and compared the raltegravir and lamivudine pharmacokinetic parameter values obtained following administration of 2 probe fixed-dose combination formulations (MK-0518B-#1 and MK-0518B-#2) to those obtained following co-administration of 800 mg Isentress and 300 mg Epivir. MK-0518B-#1= a monolithic tablet containing 400 mg of a new formulation of raltegravir and 300 mg of lamivudine. MK- 0518B-#2 (administered as 2 tablets)= a bilayer tablet containing 400 mg of the current poloxamer formulation of raltegravir (Isentress) and 150 mg of lamivudine). Part II of the study evaluated potential formulations for twice-daily dosing and compared the raltegravir and lamivudine pharmacokinetic parameter values obtained following administration of 3 probe fixed-dose combination formulations (MK-0518B-#2, MK-0518B-#3, and MK-0518B-#4) to those obtained following co-administration of 400 mg Isentress and 150 mg Epivir. MK-0518B-#3= a monolithic tablet containing 200 mg of a new formulation of raltegravir and 150 mg of lamivudine. MK-0518B-#4 = a monolithic tablet containing 400 mg of a new formulation of raltegravir and 150 mg of lamivudine. The results demonstrated that MK-0518B-#2 when compared to 400 mg Isentress + 150 mg Epivir single agents, Raltegravir AUC0-∞ and Cmax were an average of approximately 26% and 49% higher, respectively and C12hr was approximately similar. Lamivudine Cmax was 19% higher, with approximately similar AUC0-∞ and C12hr values. For MK-0518B-#3 compared to 400 mg Isentress+ 150 mg Epivir, raltegravir AUC0-∞ , Cmax, and C12hr were an average of approximately 26%, 11%, and 20% lower, respectively. LAM Cmax was 19% higher, with approximately similar AUC0-∞ and C12hr values. For MK-0518B-#4 compared to 400 mg Isentress + 150 mg Epivir, RAL AUC0-∞ , Cmax, and C12hr were an average of approximately 45%, 92%, and 31% higher, respectively. LAM Cmax was 10% higher, with approximately similar AUC0-∞ and C12hr values. Medicinal product no longer authorised

PK Model:

The population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach in NONMEM 7. Several structural models were evaluated (1-compartment, 2-compartment, with different absorption models). Allometric scaling for body weight in order to allow for simulation of paediatric subjects was assumed. Model selection was based on the Log-Likelihood Criterion, goodness of fit plots and scientific plausibility. Screening of covariates was done by graphical assessment; inclusion of covariates was based on statistical criteria in a stepwise procedure. Reliability of the final model was checked with diagnostic plots, visual predictive check and bootstrap analysis. The final PK model was used to simulate the exposure in paediatric and adult populations at steady-state.

A derived dataset for analysis was generated, and consisted of: actual dosing and blood sampling time, log transformed plasma concentration of raltegravir in lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet, actual raltegravir dose, bodyweight, body mass index (BMI), age, race, gender, food status, formulation, dosing regimen, and protocol number.

## PKPD Model:

A previously developed PK/PD viral dynamics model for raltegravir (MK-0518) + nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was used to project long-term efficacy for lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. The model was used to simulate efficacy in a hypothetical Phase 3 study (N=270/arm, 10% non-inferiority bounds) in treatment-naïve patients comparing lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (containing 300 mg raltegravir, administered BID) to Isentress (400 mg raltegravir BID), both in combination with NRTIs. Inputs to the PKPD model consisted of either (1) observed PK data from the FMI relative BA/BE studies, or (2) model predicted PK data. This approach assumes that PK profiles in healthy volunteers are similar to the patient population.

§Median (Min, Max)

Assuming linear pharmacokinetics, the oral bioavailability of the 300 mg raltegravir dose in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is considered to be 54 to 63% based on the mean exposures of raltegravir in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet observed in the 3 FMI BA/BE studies P253, P258 and P260 when compared to the mean AUC from IV microdose of raltegravir.

Bioavailability Raltegravir MK-1376 P001 Was an open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence micro-dose study to evaluate the micro-dose IV and oral PK of [ 14 C] raltegravir and 4 other [ 14 C] labeled investigational HIV-1 integrase inhibitors in healthy male subjects (N=6 per panel). The results (summarised for raltegravir only) provide raltegravir pharmacokinetics after IV administration which serve as the basis for determination of the absolute bioavailability of the Isentress FCT and lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. Following IV administration of an approximately 50 μg dose of raltegravir, the geometric mean AUC0-∞ and Cmax were 5.28 nM·hr and 4.48 nM, respectively. The clearance and volume of distribution at steady state for raltegravir were 20.6 L/hr and 32 L, respectively. Following administration of an oral solution, the geometric mean AUC0-∞ and Cmax following an approximately 50 μg oral dose of raltegravir were 4.33 nM*hr and 2.26 nM, respectively.  The observed mean bioavailability of the raltegravir oral solution is approximately 84%.

Bioequivalence The pharmacokinetics of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet were characterized in three FMI relative BA/BE studies using respective locally sourced lamivudine for US, EU, and Canada, compared to co-administration of Epivir and Isentress (P253, P258, and P260, respectively). Study P253 This was a randomized, open-label, single dose crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability between the FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and co-administration of Epivir and Isentress in healthy adult male and female subjects. There were two treatment groups: A (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet [150 mg/300 mg]) and B (Epivir 150 mg + Isentress 400 mg). One hundred and eight (108) subjects were randomized to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA. All study drugs were administered in the fasted state. One subject (subject 0099) did not contribute data to period 1 of the analysis because pharmacokinetic parameters from concentration-time profiles for raltegravir displayed pre-dose concentrations greater than 5% of their respective Cmax. There were no subjects who had pre-dose concentrations greater than 5% of Cmax at the start of period 2. Data from subjects who completed at least one period of the study were included in the final dataset and used in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. The FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (150 mg/300 mg) exhibited generally similar exposure (AUC0-48hr, and Cmax) compared with lamivudine 150 mg (Epivir) and raltegravir 400 mg (Isentress) as individual tablets. The 90% CI for the primary PK parameters (AUC0-48hr and Cmax) GMR of raltegravir and lamivudine met the BE criteria of (0.8, 1.25). C12hr of raltegravir (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet) (GMR 0.86, 90% CI: 0.79, 0.94) was slightly outside the predefined bounds of 0.8-2.00 of clinical equivalence with 400 mg of raltegravir (Isentress).

The FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (150 mg/300 mg) exhibited generally similar exposure (AUC0-48hr and Cmax,) compared with raltegravir 400 mg (Isentress) and lamivudine 150 mg (Epivir) as individual tablets. The raltegravir component was within the pre-specified bioequivalence criteria for the estimated GMR for AUC0-48hr [GMR 1.01, 90% CI: 0.92, 1.10], and slightly outside of the pre-specified criteria for C12hr [GMR 0.85, 90% CI: 0.79, 0.92], which is not considered to be clinically significant. The raltegravir Cmax (non-pivotal PK parameter in this study) in the FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was approximately 24% higher than that observed with Isentress administration. Lamivudine met the bioequivalence criteria (estimated GMR 90% CI: 0.8, 1.25) for both primary PK parameters (AUC0-48hr and Cmax).

* Estimated based on the elements of the variance-covariance matrix from the linear mixed -effect model as: CV(%) = 100*sqrt[(σ 2 A + σ 2 B -2*σAB)/2], where σ 2 A  and σ 2 B are the estimated variances on the log scale for the two treatment groups,  and σ AB is the corresponding estimated covariance, each obtained from the linear mixed effects model. ** CV = 100 x sqrt( exp(s 2 ) - 1), where s 2 is the observed variance on the natural log-scale Treatment A: Test Product; lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (300 mg/150 mg). Treatment B: Reference Products 1 &amp; 2: 400 mg Isentress + 150 mg Epivir (US sourced lamivudine) Study P258 This was a randomized, open-label, single dose crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability between the FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and co-administration of Epivir and Isentress in healthy adult male and female subjects. There were two treatment groups: A (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet [150 mg/300 mg]) and B (Issentress 400 mg + Epivir 150 mg). One hundred and eight (108) subjects were randomized to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA. All study drugs were administered in the fasted state. 103 subjects completed both periods. There were no subjects who had pre-dose concentrations greater than 5% of Cmax at the start of period 2. Data from subjects who completed at least one period of the study were included in the final dataset and used in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (150 mg/300 mg) exhibited generally similar exposure (AUC0-t, and Cmax) compared with lamivudine 150 mg (3TC) and raltegravir 400 mg (Isentress) as individual tablets. The estimated 90% CI of GMR for Cmax of raltegravir met the BE criteria of (0.80, 1.25). The AUC0-t and C12hr of raltegravir did not meet the pre-specified bounds. The deviations observed (AUC0-t [GMR 0.82, 90% CI: 0.75, 0.89] and C12hr [GMR 0.79, 90% CI: 0.73, 0.85]) relative to the reference marketed 400 mg of raltegravir (Isentress) are small and not considered to be clinically significant. Lamivudine met the bioequivalence criteria (estimated GMR 90% CI of 0.8, 1.25) for both primary PK parameters (AUC0-t and Cmax).

¥ Cmax in P258 is not a pivotal PK parameter as agreed upon with EMA/CHMP * Estimated based on the elements of the variance-covariance matrix from the linear mixed -effect model as: CV(%) = 100*sqrt[(σ 2 A + σ 2 B -2*σAB)/2], where σ 2 A and σ 2 B are the estimated variances on the log scale for the two treatment groups,  and σ AB is the corresponding estimated covariance, each obtained from the linear mixed effects model. ** CV = 100 x sqrt( exp(s 2 ) - 1), where s 2 is the observed variance on the natural log-scale Treatment A: Test Product; lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (300 mg/150 mg). Treatment B: Reference Products 1 &amp; 2: 400 mg Isentress + 150 mg Epivir (EU sourced lamivudine) Study P260 This was a randomized, open-label, single dose crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability between the FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and co-administration of Canada-sourced 3TC and Isentress in healthy adult male and female subjects. There were two treatment groups: A (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet [150 mg/300 mg]) and B (Isentress 400 mg + 3TC 150 mg). One hundred and eight (108) subjects were randomized to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA. All study drugs were administered in the fasted state. 107 subjects completed both periods. There were no subjects who had pre-dose concentrations greater than 5% of Cmax at the start of period 2. Data from subjects who completed at least one period of the study were included in the final dataset and used in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Influence of food Study P254

This was a randomised, open-label, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect of food on the FMI lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in healthy male and female subjects. There were two treatment groups: A (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet [150 mg/300 mg] administered in the fasted state) and B (lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet [150 mg/300 mg] administered in the fed state with a standard high-fat, high-calorie meal).  The high-fat, high calorie meal consisted of 2 eggs, 20 g of butter, 2 slices of toast, 113 g of hash browns, 250 mL of whole milk and 2 slices of bacon, which totalled approximately 997 kilocalorie (kcal) and 56 grams (g) of fat. Twenty (20) subjects were randomized to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA.

Similar AUC0-∞ values for fed vs. fasted were observed for both raltegravir and lamivudine: the GMR (90% CI) for raltegravir AUC [fed/fasted] was 0.94 (0.83, 1.07), and for lamivudine AUC was 0.92 (0.88, 0.98). A high-fat meal led to decreased Cmax values for both drugs: [GMR (90% CI) for [fed/fasted] being 0.77 (0.55, 1.07) for raltegravir and 0.79 (0.71, 0.89) for lamivudine] as well as a delayed Tmax (2 hours later for both raltegravir and lamivudine in the fed state). C12hr values were increased in the fed state compared to the fasted state, with the GMR (90% CI) of 1.20 (0.89, 1.61) for raltegravir and 1.53 (1.34, 1.73) for lamivudine. These increases are not considered to be of clinical significance according to the applicant. * Estimated based on the elements of the variance-covariance matrix from the linear mixed-effect model as: CV(%) =100*sqrt[(σ2 A + σ2 B -2*σAB)/2], where σ2 A and σ2 B are the estimated variances on the log scale for the two treatment groups, and σAB is the corresponding estimated covariance, each obtained from the linear mixed effects model. ** CV = 100 x sqrt( exp(s2) - 1), where s2 is the observed variance on the natural log-scale Treatment A: Fasted Treatment B: Fed (high fat meal) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

According to the applicant lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet differ from the individual components with respect to the raltegravir absorption profile, but once absorbed the distribution, metabolism, and excretion are similar to those of the reference components.

Lamivudine According to the applicant, binding of lamivudine to human plasma proteins is low (&lt;36%). From intravenous studies, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 l/kg. Limited data show that lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The mean ratio CSF/serum lamivudine concentration 2-4 hours after oral administration was approximately 0.12. The true extent of penetration or relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown. Raltegravir Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 μM. Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable extent. Elimination Lamivudine The observed half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (&gt; 70%) via the organic cationic transport system. The active moiety, intracellular lamivudine triphosphate, has a prolonged terminal half-life in the cell (16 to 19 hours) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5 to 7 hours). In 60 healthy adult volunteers, Epivir 300 mg once daily has been demonstrated to be pharmacokinetically equivalent at steady-state to Epivir 150 mg twice daily with respect to intracellular triphosphate AUC24 and Cmax. Lamivudine is predominately cleared unchanged by renal excretion. The likelihood of metabolic interactions of lamivudine with other medicinal products is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma protein binding. Raltegravir The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α-phase half-life (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Dose proportionality

Lamivudine PK is approximately linear and dose proportional. Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg.

## Inter and intra-individual variability

It is apparent from the bio-comparison studies and the bioequivalence studies that there is huge inter-individual variability with regards to raltegravir.

Special populations Impaired renal function According to the applicant no dose adjustment is recommended for raltegravir based on renal function status. For lamivudine it is recommended that the dosage is modified in patients with renal impairment. Specifically, for patients with creatinine clearance values from 30 to 49 mL/min, it is recommended that Lamivudine is dosed as 150 mg QD. For creatinine clearance values from 15-29 mL/min, lamivudine is recommended to be dosed as 150 mg first dose, then 100 mg QD. For creatinine clearance values from 5-14 mL/min, it is 150 mg first dose, then 50 mg QD. Impaired hepatic function According to the applicant no dosage adjustment is required for the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, the safety and efficacy of lamivudine and raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders and so consistent with the recommendations for Isentress and Epivir, the applicant recommends that the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Elderly According to the applicant, clinical studies of Isentress and Epivir did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years. The applicant considers that dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Because lamivudine is substantially excreted by the kidney and elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, renal function should be monitored. Children There are no PK data in paediatric patients administered the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet, pharmacokinetics of both the raltegravir and lamivudine components of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in adolescents and children are expected to be comparable to that obtained with co-administration of 400 mg twice-daily Isentress and 150 mg twice-daily Epivir. As the lamivudine component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC is bioequivalent to Epivir, no further analyses were conducted for lamivudine. The population PK model for the raltegravir component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was used to bridge the observed PK data with the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in adults to adolescents and paediatric patients by simulating anticipated raltegravir PK in the paediatric population when the FDC is administered. The raltegravir PK parameters at steady state (AUC0-12hr, Cmax and C12hr) in adolescents and children were estimated by assuming allometric scaling of the model parameters. The steady state raltegravir AUC0-12hr, Cmax, and C12hr are projected to be higher in children in the lower age (6 - 11 years) and weight group especially in the two weight bands: 30-39 kg and 40-56 kg. However, these projected values are within the range of experience with raltegravir exposure in prior long-term clinical studies in HIV-1 infected children, adolescents, and adults, and fall within a range previously shown to be associated with both safety and efficacy. The proposed use of paediatric dosing guidelines for the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet are consistent with Isentress paediatric labelling for which use of the same dose as adults is recommended and therefore is considered as appropriate.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the applicant both raltegravir and lamivudine have a low propensity to be involved in drug-drug interactions either as victims or perpetrators.

## Lamivudine Drug-Drug Interactions

According to the applicant the drug interaction profile of lamivudine tablet (Epivir) would apply directly to the lamivudine component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet because they both contain the same dose and the PK parameters are bioequivalent. Raltegravir Drug-Drug Interactions In general, the drug interaction profile of Isentress as a mono-entity is expected to apply to the raltegravir component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. However, because of the differences in dose, bioavailability and differences in plasma concentration profile, interactions that affect raltegravir absorption and interactions that affect raltegravir elimination are considered separately. Raltegravir Drug-Drug Interactions via Metabolism Mechanisms Rifampin and Other Potent Inducers An increase of dose to 800 mg BID is recommended for Isentress when co-administered with rifampin, as this strong inducer lowers raltegravir concentrations to a significant degree; since the dose of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet cannot be adjusted, use of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet with rifampin is not recommended. As the impact of other potent inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown, caution should also be used when co-administering the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet with other strong inducers of UGT1A1. Etravirine Study P214 A fixed-sequence, open-label, two-period study to evaluate the effect of etravirine on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of raltegravir after co-administration of etravirine and the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. Eighteen (18) healthy subjects received the following two treatments in a fixed sequence in Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (a and b), respectively: · Treatment Period 1: Administration of a single dose of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (150 mg/300 mg) on Day 1 · Treatment Period 2a: Administration of 200 mg etravirine (BID) for 15 days · Treatment Period 2b: 200 mg etravirine every 12 hours for 14 days; on Day 14 a single lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and etravirine were co-administered. There was a minimum of a 48 hour washout interval in between dosing in Period 1 and the initiation of dosing in Period 2a. The 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratio (GMR=85.81) of C12hr ([0.63, 1.17]) of raltegravir between the test treatment (MK-0518B + etravirine) and the reference treatment (MK-0518B alone) were within the pre-specified bounds of 0.50 to 2.00 Raltegravir Drug-Drug Interactions via Absorption Mechanisms Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

According to the applicant DDIs that affect absorption of raltegravir may be affected by the differences in bioavailability and/or PK profile of raltegravir in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to Isentress and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

can be further divided into 2 categories: 1) those that increase raltegravir PK due to increased absorption, and 2) those that decrease raltegravir PK due to interactions with metal cations.

## Drugs that increase raltegravir PK due to increased absorption

The applicant considers that for DDIs in which omeprazole, or other agents may increase gastric pH and thus increase solubility of raltegravir due to its pH-dependent solubility, the magnitude of increase is bounded by increases in bioavailability, which cannot exceed 100%. Since raltegravir in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet formulation has a higher absolute bioavailability relative to the Isentress formulation, increases in raltegravir PK by this mechanism will be similar to or less than those observed with the Isentress formulation, and therefore should not be a concern for safety or efficacy of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. In the Isentress omeprazole DDI study in healthy volunteers (P034), the geometric mean AUC0-∞ in the raltegravir alone arm was 11.0 μM·hr, which corresponds to an absolute bioavailability of 26%. The 3.12-fold increase in AUC observed in P034 thus corresponds to an absolute bioavailability of approximately 81% (thus approaching 100% bioavailabilty). Based on the AUC values observed in the FMI relative BA/BE studies, the absolute bioavailability of the raltegravir component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is approximately 54 to 63%, and an increase in bioavailability to 100% would thus represent a maximum of an approximately 1.6 to 2-fold increase in AUC. It should also be noted that the effect of omeprazole on raltegravir PK has been shown to be smaller in HIV-infected patients compared to healthy volunteer, which also supports that the likely magnitude of an interaction between agents that affect gastric pH like omeprazole and the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet will not be of clinical concern. Therefore, the labelling for the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is proposed to be consistent with the Isentress prescribing information, which recommends no dose adjustment for proton pump inhibitors and H2-blockers (e.g., omeprazole, famotidine). Drugs that decrease raltegravir PK due to interactions with metal cations For this category the applicant considers that the interaction is likely to be a function of both gastric pH and the active ingredient (raltegravir), rather than formulation composition. According to the applicant the differences in PK profile between raltegravir administered as the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and Isentress are small enough that it is unlikely that a larger interaction will be observed between metal cations and the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to that observed for Isentress but it is possible that a similar interaction would be observed. Isentress is not recommended to be co-administered with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids due to reduction in raltegravir plasma levels. This reduction is likely driven by chelation of raltegravir with these metal cations. Isentress can be administered with calcium-carbonate-containing antacids without dose adjustment, as the magnitude of the reduction in raltegravir PK when dosed with calcium carbonate-containing antacids is smaller compared to the effect of aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids. Similar recommendations are therefore appropriate for the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to Isentress: no dose adjustment is recommended for the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet when co-administered with calcium-carbonate containing antacids, and co-administration of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended.

Study P071 (QDMRK) was a multicenter, double-blind (with in-house blinding), randomized, active-controlled study in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected patients to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of once-daily (q.d.) raltegravir 800 mg PO compared with twice daily (b.i.d.) raltegravir 400 mg PO, when each was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

given in combination with Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg) q.d. for up to 96 weeks. The film-coated tablet of raltegravir (Isentress) approved for use in adult patients was used for this study. At the Week 48 primary analysis, the raltegravir 800 mg q.d. treatment group failed to demonstrate non-inferiority compared with the raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. group with respect to the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL.

An extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) analysis was conducted that showed trough concentrations, amongst other pharmacokinetic parameters, correlated with therapeutic outcome in Protocol 071-01, and that the raltegravir 800 mg q.d. regimen resulted in an approximately 4-fold higher Cmax, 6-fold lower Ctrough, and similar daily AUC [Geometric Mean (95% CI) for Cmax: 13.46 (9.38, 19.30) μM; C24hr: 40 (26, 62) based on intensive PK and 83 (73, 95) based on sparse PK; AUC0-24hr: 30.87 (22.54, 42.27) μM·hr] as compared to the raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. regimen [Geometric Mean (95% CI) for Cmax: 3.38 (2.31, 4.93 μM); C12hr: 257 (161, 408) based on intensive PK and 380 (339, 426) based on sparse PK; AUC0-24hr: 26.28 (18.90, 36.54) μM·hr]. Sparse PK sampling was conducted in nearly all patients in Protocol 071-01, and intensive. PK profiles were collected in a subset of 20 patients in the b.i.d. treatment arm and 22 patients in the q.d. treatment arm. The sparse PK sampling scheme was designed to result in a good estimate of trough concentrations for all patients (since the original objective was to conduct PK/PD analyses for efficacy endpoints); however, it does not provide a good estimate of Cmax since samples were generally not drawn around the time of peak raltegravir plasma concentrations. A number of composite parameters were calculated from the sparse PK samples and evaluated as possible PK endpoints for the pharmacokinetic - adverse event (PK-AE) analyses. Call (defined as the geometric mean of all samples for particular patients, regardless of time of collection) was determined to be the best parameter available, though results should be interpreted with caution as Call correlates only weakly with overall and peak exposure levels. For the purpose of the PK-AE analyses, Call values were sorted into quartiles where quartile 1 represents the lowest 25% of Call values and quartile 4 represents the highest 25% of Call values. Analyses were also conducted using the AUC and Cmax values measured from the intensive PK sampling, though these analyses are limited since they include only a small subset of patients. Based on the intensive PK data, daily AUC was similar for both treatment arms (GMR [90% CI] for q.d./b.i.d. = 1.17 [0.80, 1.72]), while Cmax was approximately 4- fold higher for the q.d. arm compared to the b.i.d. arm (GMR [90%CI] = 3.98 [2.58, 6.16]), and Ctrough was approximately 6-fold lower for the q.d. arm compared to the b.i.d. arm (GMR [90%CI] = 0.15 [0.09, 0.26]). The number (%) of patients in all AE categories was similar among the Call quartiles. Clinical adverse experiences were reported by 82 (86.3%), 80 (84.2%), 83 (87.4%), and 86 (90.5%) in Call quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The frequency of drug-related clinical adverse experiences among Call quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 25 (26.3%), 23 (24.2%), 24 (25.3%), and 26 (27.4%) respectively. The frequency of serious clinical adverse experiences was 3 (3.2%), 5 (5.3%), 4 (4.2%), and 9 (9.5%) in Call quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Although a higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was reported in Call quartile 4, the incidence of drug-related SAEs does not differ among the 4 quartiles. Finally, there were few discontinuations due to clinical adverse experiences and no adverse experiences resulting in death were reported among the Call quartiles of patients.

discontinuation were similar among the Call quartiles in the 800 mg q.d. raltegravir treatment group and 400 mg b.i.d. raltegravir treatment group. Furthermore, increasing raltegravir exposure had no apparent effect on predefined limits of change for laboratory tests of interest, as assessed by Call among patients in the sparse PK population. Finally, liver chemistry (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase) abnormalities were uncommon and not associated with increasing raltegravir exposure, as assessed by AUC and Cmax among patients in an intensive PK population.

2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action Lamivudine Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that consists of a dideoxy analog of cytidine, and, after phosphorylation, inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and causes premature DNA chain termination. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active metabolite (5'-triphosphate; L-TP), which is the moiety responsible for inhibition of HIV reverse transcription resulting in viral DNA chain termination. Raltegravir Raltegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Integrase is one of the three HIV-1 enzymes required for viral replication. Integrase catalyzes the stepwise process which results in the integration of the HIV-1 DNA into the genome of the host cell.  This ordered series of reactions includes the assembly of integrase in a stable complex with the viral DNA, the endonucleolytic processing of the viral DNA ends, and strand transfer or joining of the viral and cellular DNAs. Integration is required for stable maintenance of the viral genome as well as efficient viral gene expression. Raltegravir displays potent in vitro activity against HIV-1, exhibiting a mean 95% inhibitory concentration (IC95) of 33 nM (15 ng/mL) in the presence of 50% human serum. Relationship between plasmas concentration and effect Since lamivudine (LAM) met all bioequivalence criteria, no population PK model was developed for lamivudine and the relationship between plasma concentration and effect for Lamivudine in the FDC is considered by the applicant to be the same as for marketed lamivudine (Epivir). A population PK model for the raltegravir component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was developed from pooled analyses of Phase I BC and relative BA/BE studies which used the 300 mg dose and final or near-final formulation (P196, P253, P258 and P260) and the food effect study (P254). This population PK model was used to simulate raltegravir pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population administered the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and to simulate raltegravir pharmacokinetics in an adult treatment naïve HIV-infected population administered the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (demographic information from P071 (QDMRK) was used as representative of a treatment-naïve, HIV-infected population). Derived parameters [Cmax, AUC, and C12hr] were calculated from the observed data as well as from model simulations and compared. Model robustness was assessed by bootstrapping. In order to evaluate the final PK model, derived parameters [Cmax, AUClast, and C12hr] were calculated from the observed data (after single dose), as well as from model-based simulations after single dose administration and compared. Model- based simulations were Medicinal product no longer authorised

performed for the same dataset that was used to develop the model. A summary of the calculated PK parameters per study, and food effect (based on final PK model) are shown in in the table below

In most cases the model slightly over predicts AUC and Cmax values (3 to 7% higher on average), with a larger over-prediction for C12hr (25% higher on average), of which P196 study data appears to be the most over-predicted (i.e. observed: 29 ng/ml vs. model predicted: 52 ng/ml)

Additionally, a PK/PD viral dynamics model linking drug concentrations to viral inhibition, which in turn can be linked to treatment outcomes (e.g., decline in HIV viral load, % of patients &lt;50 copies/mL at a given time-point was used to predict the efficacy of the FDC tablet).This model incorporates an Emax model which is used to describe the dependence of inhibition on drug exposure, with an in vivo EC50 values (raltegravir concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of infectivity and cell activation; with separate EC50 values for each)is  estimated for raltegravir using data from study P071 with estimated values of 3.5 ng/mL (8 nM) for infectivity and 30 ng/mL (68 nM) for cell activation. From the Emax model, the equivalent constant concentration (ECC) is calculated which is the concentration which would result in the same level of average inhibition of infectivity over the dosing interval as if the concentration was held constant over the interval.

A distribution of steady state ECC values for each group was calculated based either on (1) observed full PK profiles from the FMI relative BA/BE studies, or (2) full PK profiles simulated from the population PK model. The viral dynamics model was then used to simulate the anticipated long-term efficacy in a hypothetical Phase III study (N=270/arm, 10% non-inferiority bounds) in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients comparing the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet (containing 300 mg raltegravir, administered BID) to Isentress poloxamer FCT (400 mg raltegravir BID), both in combination with NRTIs (Isentress + 2 NRTIs and the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC + 1 additional NRTI).

The applicant concluded that even though the comparison of raltegravir C12hr values for lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to the currently marketed adult Isentress formulation fell just outside the predefined

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bounds for the confidence interval around the comparison ratio, based on the modelling and historical experience, the lack of bioequivalence is not of clinical importance, as the projected true difference in the percent of patients achieving &lt;40 copies/mL of HIV RNA between raltegravir in lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet vs. Isentress treatment arms was in the range of 0.4-0.7% at Week 48 endpoints using the observed PK data.

2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of this fixed dose combination (FDC), the applicant relies on BA/BE studies P253, P258 and P260. This approach is considered acceptable in principle as the pharmacokinetic of the single agents have previously been sufficiently characterised. The formulation of raltegravir is used in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet has a higher bioavailability compared to the Isentress FCT tablet due to drug loading and processability, so a lower dose of 300 mg raltegravir is used in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet, compared to 400 mg in Isentress, in order to achieve similar plasma drug concentrations. Lamivudine For the lamivudine component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet standard BE criteria of 0.80-1.25 were used for pivotal PK parameters; AUC0-t and Cmax. Raltegravir BE criteria were defined based on the broad characterizations of exposure-response drawn from the extensive clinical experience with raltegravir which suggest that daily AUC alone was not sufficient to predict efficacy and that the trough concentration was an important factor for efficacy. Furthermore, it has previously been demonstrated in the previous application for the polaxamer formulation that trough concentrations below approximately 45 nM were associated with somewhat lower efficacy compared to higher trough concentrations (study P071). Based on this, the BE criteria for raltegravir were predefined as AUC and C12hr. The relative BA/BE criteria for assessment of equivalence for the raltegravir component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet were 90% CI of GMR of (0.80, 2.0) for C12hr and (0.80, 1.25) for AUC0-t. The results of the BE studies suggest that the Lamivudine in the FDC is bioequivalent to Epivir (US, EU and Canada sourced). With regards to Raltegravir, it would appear that Raltegravir 300mg contained in the FDC is not bioequivalent to 400mg Isentress with respect to C12 as a result the applicant provided the results of a PK PD viral modelling in support. Two analyses were presented by the applicant, one based on the population PK analysis and one based on observed raltegravir plasma concentration data. As the population PK model overestimated trough levels, only the analysis based on observed data was considered. The PK/PD dynamics model relates efficacy to raltegravir PK profile via the equivalent constant concentration (ECC).The PK PD viral dynamic model was used to simulate long term efficacy in a hypothetical phase III study comparing the raltegravir in the FDC to Isentress 400mg. The conclusion of non-inferiority was based on a comparison of the proportion of simulated subjects achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies/ml. It was inferred that the probability of achieving non-inferiority using observed PK data from BE studies was &gt;99%. The modelling approach was considered reliable, since it was able to describe the lower viral response rate observed in study QDMRK for the 800 mg poloxamer formulation and small probability of achieving non-inferiority of the 800 mg QD poloxamer formulation, consistent with the results of clinical study (P071). Overall the results of the analyses suggest that the raltegravir component of the FDC has similar efficacy to Isentress as the ECC values for the formulation are on the plateau of the viral inhibition versus concentration curve and only a small percentage (0-2%) of subjects from the bioequivalence studies are projected (using nonparametric superposition of single dose data to Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

steady-state) to have C12 values of less than 45nM (the threshold considered to be associated with reduced efficacy).

Otherwise, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Raltegravir and Lamivudine monotherapy have previously been well-characterised and there are no particular issues to highlight regarding the ADME.

There are no clinical Phase II/III studies evaluating the efficacy of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in HIV-1 infected patients. However, the demonstrated efficacy of the individual components is derived from studies which used the combination of lamivudine and raltegravir and are summarised below. Furthermore, the PK PD analyses are considered to be pivotal in determining the efficacy of this FDC.

In terms of expected drug-drug interactions the applicant has provided limited information in support with the FDC because both raltegravir and lamivudine are to a great extent unlikely to be involved in drug-drug interactions. In terms of co-administration with Etravirine the results of the bioequivalence studies demonstrate that the raltegravir component of the FDC is not bioequivalent to Isentress. This is not considered to be an issue as the applicant has clarified that a lower bound of comparability of 0.40 and an upper bound of 2.00 for C12 is applicable to raltegravir and since the results of study P214 are within this range, therefore etravirine has no clinically relevant effect on the PK of raltegravir within the FDC. Regarding DDIs that could affect the absorption of raltegravir such as omeprazole, or other agents that could increase gastric pH and increase solubility of raltegravir due to its pH-dependent solubility, the applicant considers that increases in raltegravir PK by this mechanism should be similar to or less than those observed with the Isentress formulation. However, the study P054 conducted showed that the 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratio of C12hr, Cmax, AUC0-12 for raltegravir + famotidine and raltegravir + omeprazole both fell outside the accepted bioequivalence criteria 80-125%, however the applicant considers that no dosage adjustment is necessary when these agents are given together the FDC. This is considered acceptable with appropriate warnings in section 4.5 of the SmPC as this is the case with Isentress. The applicant has not conducted any study with the FDC in relation on special populations apart from the paediatric population in which a pop PK analyses has been conducted for the raltegravir component. The results of the pop PK analyses suggest that exposure in children in the lower age group (6 - 11 years) and weight group especially in the two weight bands: 30-39 kg and 40-56 kg is higher. However, these projected values are within the range of experience with raltegravir exposure in prior long-term clinical studies in HIV-1 infected children, adolescents, and adults, and fall within a range previously shown to be associated with both safety and efficacy. The applicant has provided little information on the pharmacodynamic characteristics of raltegravir and lamivudine as single entities or as a FDC but provide PK PD analyses in support for the Raltegravir component of the FDC. No population PK model was developed for lamivudine because the BE studies conducted demonstrated that the lamivudine component of the FDC is bioequivalent to lamivudine monotherapy (Epivir). The information provided is considered acceptable. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology From the results of the PK PD modelling, it is considered that the lack of bioequivalence of C12 in all BE studies conducted should not have an impact on the efficacy of raltegravir. 2.5.

## 2.5.1. Main studies

Summary of main efficacy results Efficacy of Lamivudine Lamivudine was studied in four randomised controlled clinical trials (NUCA3001, NUCB3001, NUCA3002 and NUCB3002). In total, 495 treatment-naïve and 477 treatment-experienced adults were enrolled. Efficacy criteria included immunological markers (CD4 count), HIV-1 RNA viral load, progression of HIV-1 disease and resistance with zidovudine as comparator.  Efficacy was demonstrated by a higher, and more sustained CD4 count increase from baseline in the lamivudine combination group vs. the zidovudine monotherapy group and a greater decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA effect with combination therapy vs. zidovudine monotherapy. In a meta-analysis of the four trials, there was a significant reduction in the rate of progression to new AIDS defining endpoints (CDC C and CDC B/C). An additional clinical endpoint trial, the CAESAR trial, (NUCB3007) was designed to assess the clinical benefit of adding lamivudine to zidovudine-based regimens in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease (CD4 range 25-250/mcl) to current treatment. Eighteen hundred ninety five (1895) HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients were randomized to receive placebo, lamivudine (150 mg BID), or lamivudine (150 mg BID) plus loviride for 52 weeks. The study was discontinued early due to a highly significant reduction in progression to AIDS or death in the groups receiving lamivudine.  At the time of the interim analysis, the rate of progression to AIDS or death was 17% (81 of 482 patients) in the placebo group, 9% (80 of 935) in the lamivudine group, and 8% (38 of 475) in the lamivudine/loviride group (p&lt;0.0001). The efficacy of lamivudine in children was demonstrated in ACTG 300, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing lamivudine plus zidovudine with didanosine monotherapy in symptomatic HIV infected treatment-naïve children aged 6 weeks to 14 years. In ACTG 300, dual therapy resulted in a decrease in HIV-1 disease progression or death relative to monotherapy (6.4% vs. 15.7 %).  There was a significant reduction of HIV-1 RNA and significant increase of CD4 cell count in the combination arm as compared to the didanosine monotherapy arm. Efficacy of Raltegravir Previous raltegravir applications have provided efficacy data to support the use of raltegravir at a dose of 400 mg BID in combination regimens in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults as well as confirmation of the durability of efficacy and safety of raltegravir in this population. The efficacy and safety data of raltegravir in HIV-1 infected adults to support this application has been demonstrated through Phase II studies in treatment-naïve (P004) and treatment-experienced (P005) patients and in pivotal Phase III studies in treatment-experienced patients (P018X01, P019X01], also known as BENCHMRK) and treatment-naïve patients (P021), also known as STARTMRK). Long term data from these treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced adult studies demonstrate raltegravir has potent and durable efficacy that is sustained through Week 240.

The efficacy of raltegravir in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age was demonstrated in data submitted in support of the initial Paediatric Application in patients 2 to 18 years of age (EMEA/H/C/000860/X/024/G). The pediatric application was based upon IMPAACT P1066/Merck P022, a Phase I/II pediatric study in patients 4 weeks to 18 years of age, evaluating three different formulations of raltegravir: the adult 400 mg FCT (poloxamer) in patients 6 to 18 years of age; a chewable tablet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(ethylcellulose) in patients 2 to less than 12 years of age; and raltegravir granules for suspension in patients 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age. The consistent antiretroviral and immunologic efficacy data of raltegravir provided as either of 2 formulations in pediatric patients ages 2 through 18 years supported the approval of raltegravir in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents, 2 to 18 years of age, dosed as (a) one 400-mg FCT twice daily (BID) in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age, and children 6 to less than 12 years of age weighing at least 25 kg; and (b) as weight-based twice-daily oral dosing with chewable tablets in children 2 to less than 12 years of age.

Efficacy of the Individual Components, Lamivudine and Raltegravir, Administered in Combination Within the raltegravir development program, the efficacy of lamivudine and raltegravir co-administrated as individual agents, along with tenofovir, was demonstrated in a Phase II raltegravir dose ranging study (P004). Study P004 A double-blind, randomized, 2-part dose-ranging study in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients. Part I consisted of a 10-day period of raltegravir monotherapy (100, 200, 400, and 600 mg b.i.d.) versus placebo. Part II consisted of initial 48-week period of raltegravir (4 doses) versus efavirenz (EFV) (control group), each in combination with tenofovir and lamivudine. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 400 mg b.i.d. raltegravir compared to efavirenz at 240 weeks of therapy and to evaluate the long-term antiretroviral activity of 400 mg b.i.d. raltegravir compared to efavirenz, as measured by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels below the threshold of quantification (&lt;50 copies/mL) at 240 weeks of therapy. There was no discernible difference in efficacy at Week 48 between any of the raltegravir doses studied; some of which were with associated lower exposures, than the 400mg BID dose which was selected for further study. After the 48 week dose ranging part of the study (once 400 mg BID  was selected as the dose in Phase III trials), the 160 patients randomised to one of the four doses of raltegravir were switched to 400 mg BID raltegravir in combination with tenofovir and lamivudine and received treatment for a total duration of 240 weeks. Table 6 summarizes the percentages of patients with HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 240 by original randomized treatment groups, as well as a group combining patients who received any dose of raltegravir (non-completer = failure). HIV-1 RNA remained suppressed to &lt;50 copies per mL in 68.8% of patients in the combined raltegravir group and 63.2% in the efavirenz group.

Analyses by Baseline HIV RNA Level Week 240 efficacy analyses were performed based on baseline HIV RNA level (with 2 different cuts: 50,000 copies/mL and 100,000 copies/mL). The raltegravir group showed antiretroviral efficacy regardless of baseline HIV RNA level. Time to Virologic Response Patients receiving raltegravir achieved HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL sooner than those on efavirenz (log-rank test p&lt;0.001 for comparison of raltegravir with efavirenz). Time to Virologic Failure For patients who achieved HIV RNA less than 400 copies/mL at Week 24; the time to virologic failure is the time between randomization and the first value above the assay limit after 24 weeks or loss to follow-up. For patients who did not achieve HIV RNA values less than 400 copies/mL at Week 24 time to virologic failure is considered 24 weeks. Resistance Virologic failure occurred in 10 (6%) of 160 patients in the raltegravir group and in 5 (13%) of 38 patients in the efavirenz group by week 240. In the raltegravir group, 3 patients failed prior to Week 48, 3 patients failed between Weeks 48 and 96, and 4 patients failed following Week 96. In the efavirenz group, 1 patient failed prior to Week 48, 1 patient failed between Weeks 48 and 96, and 3 patients failed following Week 96.

Furthermore, the efficacy of the combination of lamivudine and raltegravir has additionally been demonstrated in other clinical studies conducted by other sponsors. Lamivudine and raltegravir were apparently co-administered in a subgroup of patients in the SPRING-2 study, a 96 week, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study of dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) vs. raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) in combination with co-formulated tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine in treatment-naïve HIV infected patients. In a sensitivity analysis based on NRTI backbone using a treatment related discontinuation equals failure analysis, at Week 96, 76% (124/164) of patients who received the combination of raltegravir and abacavir/lamivudine had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml as compared with 74% (125/169) of patients who received dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine. In comparison, 77% (190/247) of patients who received raltegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml at Week 96, as compared with

Overall the results of the analyses suggest that the raltegravir component of the FDC has similar efficacy to Isentress as the ECC values for the formulation are on the plateau of the viral inhibition versus concentration curve and only a small percentage (0-2%) of subjects from the bioequivalence studies are projected (using nonparametric superposition of single dose data to steady-state) to have C12 values of less than 45nM (the threshold considered to be associated with reduced efficacy).   The results of the population PK analysis suggest that exposure in children in the lower age group (6 - 11 years) and weight group especially in the two weight bands: 30-39 kg and 40-56 kg is higher. However, these projected values are within the range of experience with raltegravir exposure in prior long-term clinical studies in HIV-1 infected children, adolescents, and adults, and fall within a range previously shown to be associated with both safety and efficacy.

86% (207/242) of patients who received dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine [Lancet Infect Dis 2013;13: 927-35].

In the SHIELD trial, thirty-five (35) HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve patients received raltegravir 400 mg BID plus coformulated abacavir/lamivudine 600mg/300 mg in an open-label fashion for 96 weeks. At Weeks 48 and 96, HIV-1 RNA was &lt;50 copies/ml in 91% (32/35) and 77% (27/35), respectively, of patients using a missing or discontinuation equals failure (MD=F) analysis and 94% vs. 96% (27/28), respectively, using an observed analysis [HIV Clin Trials 201;12(4):228-233]. Efficacy demonstrated in the SHIELD study is consistent with that observed in other raltegravir trials. The combination of raltegravir and abacavir/lamivudine or zidovudine/lamivudine was also studied retrospectively in 28 HIV-infected Korean adults [Jpn. J. Infect. Dis., 66, 317-319, 2013]. Thirteen (13) patients were treatment-naïve and 15 patients were treatment-experienced. Of the 15 treatment-experienced patients, 13 were switched from a lopinavir/ritonavir regimen due to hyperlipidaemia and diarrhoea. Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;48 copies/mL) was achieved in 12/13 (92%) of the treatment-naïve patients at Week 24. One (7%) of the 15 treatment-experienced patients experienced a loss of virological suppression after switching to raltegravir and was found to have two NRTI resistance. 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy There are no clinical Phase II/III studies evaluating the efficacy of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in HIV-1 infected patients; the clinical program focuses on demonstrating bioequivalence of the FDC to raltegravir (400mg) and lamivudine 150mg as single agents. The demonstrated efficacy of the individual components is derived from studies which used the combination of lamivudine and raltegravir, in particular study 004 which was a double-blind, randomized, 2-part dose-ranging study in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 400 mg b.i.d. raltegravir compared to efavirenz at 240 weeks of therapy and to evaluate the long-term antiretroviral activity of 400 mg b.i.d. raltegravir compared to efavirenz, as measured by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels below the threshold of quantification (&lt;50 copies/mL) at 240 weeks of therapy. This study was conducted to in two parts. Part I was conducted mainly to demonstrate the efficacy of raltegravir in comparison to placebo and part II was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of raltegravir in comparison to Efavirenz (both in combination with Tenofovir and lamivudine. Different doses of raltegravir were used up to 48 weeks after which 400mg bid was continued (subjects on different doses were switched). According to the study results provided, there was no discernible difference in efficacy between any of the raltegravir doses but some were associated with lower exposures. Overall, the results of this study showed that HIV-1 RNA remained suppressed to &lt;50 copies per ml in approximately 69% of patients in the combined raltegravir group compared with 63% in the Efavirenz group. In terms of the results obtained a 240 weeks, efficacy appeared to be similar in both groups (raltegravir and Efavirenz). Overall the results suggest that raltegravir 400mg b.i.d. in combination with lamivudine + Tenofovir is efficacious. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of study 004 suggest that raltegravir 400mg b.i.d. in combination with lamivudine + Tenofovir is efficacious. Taking into consideration the conclusion of the PK PD modelling it is considered that the results from this study can be extrapolated to the FDC. The results from the population PK model provide evidence of the efficacy of the FDC in the paediatric population, the projected higher exposure in children in the lower age (6 11 years) and weight group especially in the two weight bands: 30-39 kg and 40-56 kg fall within a range previously shown to be associated with both safety and efficacy.

The safety of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet comes from the Phase I studies, including three BC studies (P089, P196, P269), three FMI relative BA/BE studies (P253, P258, P260), one FMI food effect study (P254), and one DDI study (P214). Four hundred and forty five (445) subjects (217 males; 228 females) received at least one dose of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in these 8 Phase I studies (P089, P196, P214, P253, P254, P258, P260, and P269). In seven of these studies, the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was given as a single

2.6. Clinical safety Aside from the short-term data from the Phase I studies in healthy subjects, there are no clinical studies evaluating the safety of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in patients. The safety of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is supported by the safety of the individual components, the safety of the individual components given in combination and also by safety data from studies conducted by other sponsors who included this combination of ART. Safety of Lamivudine and Raltegravir Administered in Combination The long-term safety of lamivudine and raltegravir given in combination with another antiretroviral agent (tenofovir) was demonstrated in P004, a two part Phase II dose-ranging study of raltegravir in combination with lamivudine and tenofovir vs. EFV in combination with lamivudine and tenofovir in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Safety of the Lamivudine/Raltegravir FDC tablet The safety of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet comes from the Phase I studies, including three BC studies (P089, P196, P269), three FMI relative BA/BE studies (P253, P258, P260), one FMI food effect study (P254), and one DDI study (P214). Four hundred and forty five (445) subjects (217 males; 228 females) received at least one dose of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet in these 8 Phase I studies (P089, P196, P214, P253, P254, P258, P260, and P269).  In seven of these studies, the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was given as a single administration in crossover studies at a dose strength of 150 mg/300 mg (P196, P214, P253, P254, P258, P260, and P269). In P089, the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was given in a single administration in a crossover study at a dose strength of 150 mg/200 mg and 150 mg/400 mg. In the Phase I studies, in addition to receiving the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet, three hundred and eighty three (383) subjects received co-administration of raltegravir as Isentress 400 mg and lamivudine as Epivir 150 mg (either US, EU, or Canada sourced) as individual tablets in these crossover studies (P089, P196, P253, P258, P260).

Adverse events In the phase I studies, a total of 461 AEs were reported, of which 184 were considered to be related to study drug. The most common drug related AEs (&gt; 3%) reported were headache (28%), somnolence (19%), increase in ALT (5%) and nausea (4%). Almost all drug related AEs reported were mild in intensity, with only a few considered as moderate and none were severe. Of the 9 subjects who discontinued due to an AE in the Phase I studies, 4 of those AEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. These include three (3) subjects in P214 who discontinued due to an AE of full body rash (all occurred after administration of etravirine only) and one (1) subject in P258 who discontinued due to vomiting. Clinically significant abnormalities on routine laboratory safety tests were not observed in the Phase I studies in which the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet was administered; no clinically significant abnormalities were noted in routine blood and urine chemistry panels or complete blood counts obtained for safety purposes in each study. Clinically significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) readings or vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature) were not observed in the Phase I studies with the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet. The clinical and laboratory AE profiles for patients in study P004 in the combined therapy phase through Week 240 is shown in Table 10. Patients who received raltegravir at any dose during Part I were combined in one group. Drug-related AEs in the summary table are the overall drug-related AE, which are defined as related to any component of the regimen. In the Week 240 final safety analysis, raltegravir remained generally well tolerated over a 240 week period. There was 1 serious drug-related clinical AE and no deaths resulting from treatment with raltegravir. There were very few Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities, serious drug-related AEs or discontinuations due to AEs. Laboratory AEs and Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities of AST and ALT were infrequent and occurred at similar low frequencies in both treatment groups. Serial measurement of fasting lipids over 240 weeks revealed no adverse impact of raltegravir on serum lipids. In addition, serial anthropomorphic measurements showed no meaningful changes over 240 weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 10 Clinical Adverse Experience Summary (P004, Cohorts I and II Combined; Combination Therapy Phase)

†  Determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely drug related to any component in the study drug regimen (blinded drug alone or blinded drug in combination or tenofovir or 3TC) ‡Includes AN 117; patient was recorded as having a medication error and this NSAE was incorrectly recorded as being an overdose, which is counted as a SAE §AN 308 in the raltegravir group experienced a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience of osteonecrosis and this event was considered to be related to open-label tenofovir. Note: Raltegravir and efavirenz are taken in combination with tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events There were no deaths but there was 1 serious adverse experience (SAE) considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug. The SAE of 'abortion induced' was reported in P089 after the treatment portion of the study. The subject was a 39 year old female who had negative pregnancy tests at screening and prior to each treatment period. A pregnancy test was inadvertently omitted at the two week post-study visit, and the subject returned 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration at which time the urine assay was positive and serum beta-HCG testing was consistent with an 8-10 week pregnancy. Due to the age of the subject, an amniocentesis was performed which revealed the foetus had mosaic Turner Syndrome and the subject elected to terminate the pregnancy.

There were very few Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities, serious drug-related AEs or discontinuations due to AEs. Laboratory AEs and Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities of AST and ALT were infrequent and occurred at similar low frequencies in both treatment groups.  Serial measurement of fasting lipids over 240 weeks revealed no adverse impact of raltegravir on serum lipids.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The applicant has not provided an extensive description of the safety profile of the FDC, however this is not considered to be a significant concern as the safety of the single components (raltegravir and lamivudine) have previously been well characterised. The limited information provided suggests that the safety profile of the FDC is comparable to that of the single components administered in combination.

<!-- image -->

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety From the limited information provided by the applicant, there are no particular concerns to highlight. Both raltegravir and lamivudine have been used for many years and it is considered that the safety of both single components can be extrapolated to the FDC. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. 2.8. Risk Management Plan The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.3 with the following content: Safety concerns Important identified risks Lamivudine and Raltegravir Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome Drug resistance Raltegravir Drug interaction with rifampin and other strong UGT1A1 inducers Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Benefits Beneficial effects Lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of lamivudine (150 mg) and raltegravir (300 mg) to be administered twice daily (BID) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1). The lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet has been developed for an indication in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced) in adults, adolescents, and paediatric patients. It is intended to reduce pill burden as compared to dosing with the individual agents and flexibility to choose additional agents to design a complete treatment regimen which in principle is considered acceptable. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects The FDC is a monolithic, film-coated, compressed tablet containing lamivudine and raltegravir with a new formulation of raltegravir, different from the poloxamer FCT formulation in Isentress developed by the applicant to address drug loading, processability, and pharmacokinetic considerations. This formulation apparently has a higher bioavailability compared to the Isentress poloxamer FCT formulation, and a lower dose of 300 mg raltegravir is used in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to 400 mg in Isentress poloxamer FCT, in order to achieve comparable C12hr and AUC0-t. For the lamivudine component of the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet standard BE criteria of 0.80-1.25 were used for pivotal PK parameters; AUC0-t and Cmax. For Raltegravir, BE criteria were defined based on the broad characterizations of exposure-response drawn from the extensive clinical experience with raltegravir which suggest that daily AUC alone was not sufficient to predict efficacy and that the trough concentration was an important factor for efficacy. Furthermore, it has previously been demonstrated in the previous application for the polaxamer formulation that trough concentrations below approximately 45 nM were associated with somewhat lower efficacy compared to higher trough concentrations (study P071). Based on this, the BE criteria for raltegravir were predefined as AUC and C12hr. In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of this fixed dose combination (FDC), the applicant relies on BA/BE studies P253, P258 and P260. The results of the BE studies suggest that the Lamivudine in the FDC is bioequivalent to Epivir (US, EU and Canada sourced). With regards to Raltegravir, it would appear that Raltegravir 300mg contained in the FDC is not bioequivalent to 400mg Isentress with respect to C12. As a result, PK PD (viral dynamic modelling) analysis of the Raltegravir component of the FDC was provided in support. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Two analyses were presented by the applicant, one based on the population PK analysis and one based on observed raltegravir plasma concentration data. As the population PK model overestimated trough levels, only the analysis based on observed data was considered. The PK/PD dynamics model relates efficacy to raltegravir PK profile via the equivalent constant concentration (ECC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall the results of the analyses suggest that the raltegravir component of the FDC has similar efficacy to Isentress as the ECC values for the formulation are on the plateau of the viral inhibition versus concentration curve and only a small percentage (0-2%) of subjects from the bioequivalence studies are projected (using nonparametric superposition of single dose data to steady-state) to have C12 values of less than 45nM (the threshold considered to be associated with reduced efficacy).

The intention behind this FDC is to reduce pill burden as compared to dosing with the individual agents and flexibility to choose additional agents to design a complete treatment regimen. Due to drug-loading, processability, and pharmacokinetic considerations this formulation of raltegravir in the FDC has a higher bioavailability compared to the Isentress poloxamer FCT formulation, and a lower dose of 300 mg raltegravir is used in the lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet compared to 400 mg in Isentress poloxamer FCT. However

Risks Unfavourable effects There are no significant issues with regard to unfavourable effects as both raltegravir and lamivudine have been used for many years and it is considered that the safety of both single components is well characterised and can be extrapolated to the FDC. It should be noted however that only adult healthy volunteers have been exposed to this fixed dose combination during the studies submitted in support of this FDC. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects The applicant has not provided an extensive description of the safety profile of the FDC. An overview of the duration of exposures within the clinical pharmacology studies and an integration of the safety profiles of lamivudine and raltegravir are lacking. However, in the view of the fact that bioequivalence for lamivudine was adequately demonstrated between the fixed dose combination and the marketed formulations of lamivudine, it is most likely that this fixed dose combination will probably have a similar safety profile to that of the single components. For raltegravir, even though C12 was found not to be bioequivalent to 400mg Isentress, it is considered that safety profiles for both will be similar as the results of the PK PD modelling which suggest that the raltegravir component of the FDC has similar efficacy to Isentress provides additional reassurance. Predicted raltegravir exposure (AUC, Cmax and C12hr) in the subset of the paediatric population (children ≥6 years and adolescents) dosed with the raltegravir FDC tablet is projected to be higher, when compared to adults dosed with lamivudine/raltegravir FDC tablet and also in comparison with exposure after weight based dosing of the chewable tablet in the same age range. However, the 90th percentile raltegravir exposure values projected for dosing with the FDC do not exceed the highest raltegravir exposure values obtained in prior clinical studies, even in children weighing 30 kg where typical values of AUC0-12 and Cmax do not seem to raise safety concerns. Furthermore, a number of children have apparently had AUC values greater than the projected exposure without any significant adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bioequivalence could not be demonstrated for C12 even though it is considered by the applicant to be useful and vital for predicting efficacy. However the results of the PK PD modelling suggest similar efficacy for the FDC in comparison to the single components.

Benefit-risk balance Discussion on the benefit-risk balance It is acknowledged that the two antiretroviral agents, lamivudine and raltegravir, are frequently taken together in clinical practice with lamivudine usually co-formulated with other NRTI compounds. It should be noted that other antiretrovirals would have to be co-administered with this FDC in line with EACS 2013 guideline. Also, the FDC will need to be administered twice daily (BID), therefore it is not clear whether this proposed FDC will lead to improvement in patient compliance and satisfaction but it is acknowledged that both have been used concomitantly in the past and they both have well-characterised profiles of efficacy and safety. Overall, the benefit risk is considered positive since the applicant has resolved the concern regarding the PK PD model therefore the results obtained with Isentress can be extrapolated to the FDC. 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Dutrebis in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, and children from the age of 6  years and weighing at least 30 kg without present or past evidence of viral resistance to antiviral agents of the InSTI (Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor) and NRTI (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor) classes, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription.
