## 1. Introduction

On 05 th  August 2025, the MAH submitted an interim report presenting the safety results only of a completed paediatric study for SCENESSE, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study 'A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Afamelanotide in Patients with Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)', CUV052, a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multicentre clinical Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of afamelanotide, and the changes in melanin density of the skin by reflectance spectrophotometry in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is part of the paediatric clinical development programme for SCENESSE. The availability and comparison of adult and adolescent pharmacokinetic data will contribute to a deeper understanding of SCENESSE and may subsequently inform future development studies by the Applicant, such as the development of the age-appropriate formulation.

A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package to support the extension of indication from adults to adolescents is expected to be submitted by the fourth quarter of 2025.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Treatment was given with 16 mg afamelanotide controlled-release implant, with afamelanotide contained in a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) implant core.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted an interim report for:

- CUV052, 'A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Afamelanotide in Patients with Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)', a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multi-centre clinical Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of afamelanotide, and the changes in melanin density of the skin by reflectance spectrophotometry in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## CUV052, 'A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Afamelanotide in Patients with Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)'

## Description

The study was a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multi-centre clinical Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single afamelanotide dose, and the changes in melanin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

density of the skin by reflectance spectrophotometry in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).

Two age cohorts were to be evaluated in the study:

- Age Cohort 1: Adults (18 to ≤ 70 years)
- Age Cohort 2: Adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years)

## Methods

A total of twenty-eight EPP patients (fourteen adolescents and fourteen adult patients) were enrolled in the study and administered a single 16 mg SCENESSE implant.  Blood samples were collected for the analysis of afamelanotide plasma concentrations at baseline (prior to implant administration) and on Day 0 (4 hours and 8 hours after implant administration), Day 1 (24 hours and 32 hours), Day 2 (48 hours), Day 4 (96 hours) and Day 7 (168 hours). Melanin density was measured on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90. The change in melanin density was calculated across six anatomical sites (forehead, left cheek, right inside upper arm, left medial forearm, right side of abdomen (avoiding implant insertion site) and left side of sacral region/buttock) and overall (average across test sites). Safety monitoring was conducted for a duration of up to 90 days inclusive.

## Study participants

## Treatments

A single afamelanotide implant will be administered at baseline via subcutaneous administration.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this study were to determine:

- the pharmacokinetics of afamelanotide following its administration to adolescent and adult EPP participants
- The relative comparability of the PK profiles of afamelanotide between adolescent and adult EPP participants.

The secondary objectives of this study were to determine:

- the safety and tolerability of afamelanotide in adolescent and adult EPP participants;
- changes in melanin density of the skin using reflectance spectrophotometry;
- the comparability of changes in melanin density between adolescent and adult EPP participants following treatment with afamelanotide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

The primary endpoints for this study were the following PK parameters:

- Cmax: Maximum observed plasma concentration following treatment administration, taken directly from the data without interpolation.
- AUC(0-t): Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero (drug administration) to the last observed concentration at time t, calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

The secondary endpoints for this study were the following PK parameters:

- AUC(0-∞ ): Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity, calculated using the trapezoidal rule extrapolated to infinite time.
- tmax: Time to reach Cmax, taken directly from the data without interpolation.
- t1/2: Apparent plasma concentration half-life, calculated as ln(2)/ λ z.
- λ z: Terminal rate constant.

Other secondary endpoints include:

- Adverse events and changes in clinical measurements from baseline.
- Changes in melanin density from baseline in adult and adolescent EPP participants.
- Comparison of melanin density in adult and adolescent EPP participants.

## Safety Endpoint:

The safety and tolerability of afamelanotide was evaluated by monitoring and recording the type and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during the study period, which were listed by intensity, seriousness, outcome, and relationship to study drug. The number of participants with TEAEs were summarised by MedDRA preferred term and body system. Additional safety assessments included monitoring changes in vital signs, laboratory parameters, physical examination abnormalities and concomitant medications. TEAEs were reviewed before and after IMP administration on Day 0.

## Sample size

Fourteen participants per age cohort were planned to be included.

The sample size has been selected to ensure 12 evaluable patients from each group are recruited and data are available, as per the bioequivalence guidelines.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical Methods

Statistical analyses are only planned for pharmacokinetic data and melanin density. Results for these endpoints is pending. Statistical analysis of safety data was not performed.

Patients are summarisedonceforeachevent accordingtothemaximumseverity.

## Drug-related Serious Adverse Events

None of the reported AEs were assessed as severe. The maximum severity of any AE was moderate. No SAEs were reported in either adolescent or adult participants. All related AEs were assessed as mild in severity. There were no reports of moderate or severe TEAEs related to study treatment.

## Discontinuations and Interruptions Due to Adverse Events

There were no discontinuations and interruptions due to adverse events. This was a single-dose study.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation, Vital Signs and Other Observations Related to Safety

All 28 participants had at least one biochemistry result (excluding PPIX results) outside of the normal range, however, these were assessed by the Investigator as not clinically significant apart from results in four participants during the study, none of which were assessed as related to study treatment. Abnormal urinalysis results observed throughout the study were assessed in 24 participants by the Investigator as not clinically significant, except for one case of haematuria that was assessed as not related to study treatment.

Abnormal values for blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature were observed in 16 participants at various timepoints during the study. However, only one of these abnormalities was assessed as clinically significant by the Investigator. This assessment was given to a blood pressure value at the Screening visit.

None of the reported abnormalities in vital signs and physical examination findings were SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted study (CUV052) was a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multi-centre clinical Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of afamelanotide, and the changes in melanin density of the skin by reflectance spectrophotometry in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age)

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 EMADOC-1700519818-2360772

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Twenty-eight participants were enrolled, 14 adolescents and 14 adults.

## Efficacy &amp; Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic results and melanin density results are pending. The Applicant remarks that full efficacy results, including melanin density (a pharmacodynamic measure), are expected to be available by January 2026.

## Safety

The safety of SCENESSE was generally comparable between adolescent and adult EPP patients. Reported adverse events were in line with the known safety profile when SCENESSE is used in adults. No new safety concerns were noted. However, the significance of the findings is limited by the small number of participants in the safety population.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The Applicant has submitted the interim report presenting only the safety data of a completed paediatric study for SCENESSE, a phase II open-label, non-randomized, multi-centre clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of afamelanotide, and the changes in melanin density of the skin by reflectance spectrophotometry in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and adults with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) (CUV052).

No major concerns with regards to safety were noted. Although the safety population was very limited.

Pharmacokinetic results and melanin density results from study CUV052 are pending.

No claims or proposals for updates of the product information are made in this submission.

Once the full dataset from study CUV052 is available, including pharmacokinetic results and melanin density results, prompt submission of a type 2 variation for assessment of the data would be expected.

The benefit-risk balance for the approved indications remains favourable.
