## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 30 September 2024 an application for group of variations.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                                                                                                | Type              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| C.I.13                   | C.I.13 Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority                                                           | Variation type II |
| C.I.11.b                 | C.I.11.b Implementation of change(s) which require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH where significant assessment by the competent authority is required* | Variation type II |

A grouped application consisting of:

C.I.11.b: Submission of an updated RMP version 13.1 in order to include Protocol amendment no. 5 where the study design and objectives were revised for an interventional study C4591048, a master phase 1/2/3 protocol to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of bivalent BNT162b2 RNA- based vaccine candidate(s) in healthy children, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP.

C.I.13: Submission of the final report from study C4591044 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is an interventional randomised, active controlled, Phase 2/3 Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Bivalent BNT162b RNA-Based Vaccine Candidates as A Booster Dose In COVID-19 Vaccine-Experienced Healthy Individuals. The RMP version 13.1 has also been submitted.

The requested variation(s) proposed amendments to the amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). There was no proposed changes for SmPC.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Within this variation, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report (CSR) for C4591044. This report includes the final data for study C4591044 (Cohort 2 and 3 combined). Study C4591044 is a randomised, active controlled, Phase 1/2/3 study investigating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 30 or 60µg in participants in three age groups: 12-17 years, 18-55 years and &gt;55 years. Bivalent (wild-type/omicron (WT/OMI) BA.4-5) was given as the fourth dose (second booster). The study was listed as a category 3 study in the RMP.

Immunogenicity data for 1-, 3- and 6-months post-booster in participants ≥ 12 years of age were presented. The 1 month post-booster data were evaluated earlier (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G). The aim of the currently presented immunogenicity analysis were to follow up the antibody persistance, to explore cross-neutralising antibodies to other new circulating omicron variants and describe the cellmediated immunity after the vaccination with bivalent original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine. The analysis was descriptive, which was agreed to earlier. The methodology of this study has been assessed during earlier procedures and found to be acceptable.

Persistent antibody level were observed up to 6 months post-vaccination in all age groups regardless of baseline COVID-19 immune status. The adolescent group demonstrated higher neutralising antibody levels than adults and older adults as expected. All participants had high a level of neutralising antibodies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

against wt strain at baseline due to recent vaccination (less than 1 year ago) with Original vaccine. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.

The non-validated fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT) assay was used to evaluate cross-neutralising responses to Omicron XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and CH.1.1. The GMTs for these types were very low indicating limited cross-neutralisation for these types. No clinically important protection against COVID-19 caused by these types is expected after the bivalent Original/Omi BA.4-5 vaccination.

T-cell responses generally peaked at 1 week post-vaccination increased slightly post-Dose 1 and remained unchanged at all other timepoints. This trend was observed across both age groups and dose levels. There was a skewing of the CD4 T-cell population towards IFNγ production rather than IL -4, suggesting a Th1-biased response. This is an expected result as Th1 cells are responsible for mediating a cellular immune response to virally infected cells, such as SARS-CoV-2.

The safety data provided in this study are the adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported from study vaccination through 6 months vaccination in study C4591044. Methods and safety data for participants who received a 30 or 60μg dose of BNT162b2 Original/BA.4 -5 as Dose 4, including local reactions and systemic events recorded in the e-diary for 7 days after vaccination through 1-month after study vaccination were previously described in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G.

During the reporting interval, any AEs were reported in 10-14% of the participants. Among these events, 2-5% were considered related to study vaccination. The participants aged &gt;55 years reported the lowest frequency of related AEs (2%). Most of the related AEs were consistent with reactogenicity and preferred terms (PTs) already included in the SmPC.

In total 13 participants reported SAEs. One participant in the age group 12 through 17 years of age reported alcohol poisoning, among the subjects aged 18-&lt;55 years one participant reported diverticulitis and another hypotension. Nine participants aged &gt;55 years reported SAEs which included arrhythmia, post-procedural infection, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, adenocarcinoma pancreas, leukemia, prostate cancer, and urinary tract obstruction. One participant aged &gt;55 years died due to left ventricular failure. None of the events were considered related to study vaccination.

No cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were reported up to 6 months after study vaccination.

No new safety concern was identified.

A total of 68 participants reported COVID-19 occurrence. Overall, the most frequently determined lineage was identified as XBB.1.5 (Omicron) which reflects the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 at that time.

No update of the product information has been proposed by the MAH, which is endorsed.

Study C4591048 is a Phase 1/2/3 master study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of variant-adapted BNT162b2 RNA-based vaccine candidates.  This report includes the changes in this study described in amendment 5 evaluated via this underlying Type II Variation Procedure. Protocol amendment 5 was predominantly targeted for Substudy E study design and was developed based on feedback from US FDA. The amendments are well reasoned and no loss of information is expected due to the removal of the Substudy E, Group 1 as this age and dose group is covered in Substudy A Phase 1. The amendments are therefore acceptable

The updates on the RMP are acceptable.

The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY remains positive.

Refer to Section 2.5.1.1.1 for further details on study design. a.

Study C4591044 was a randomised, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of new variant-adapted vaccines. Participants were divided into cohorts to be studied in a staggered or parallel manner. Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 evaluated BNT162b2 Bivalent vaccine that included Original/OMI BA.4-5, in 940 participants ≥ 12 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohort 2: approximately 500 participants 12 years of age and older who received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 30μg received 30 μg or 60 μg of BNT162b2 Bivalent ( ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) as Dose 4.

- Participants 12 through 17 years of age (Group 1; n=100) received a single 30μg dose of BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) (open-label).
- Participants 18 through 55 (Groups 2 and 3) and &gt;55 (Groups 4 and 5) years of age (n=100 in each group) were randomised 1:1 within each age group to receive BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5 ) at either 30 or 60 μg (observer -blind).

Cohort 3: approximately 400 participants 18 years of age and older (200 participants 18 through 55 years of age [Group 1] and 200 participants &gt;55 years of age [Group 2]) who received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 30μg, received 30 μg of BNT162b2 Bivalent ( ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) as Dose 4 (open-label).

The 1-months post vaccination data from study C4591044 was assessed during procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G to authorize ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5 among individuals over 12 years of age (15/15 micrograms)/dose and children 5-11 years of age 5/5 micrograms)/dose. Also, the 1-month post-vaccination data was presented in procedures EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/059-0.59.3. Current submission follows the same study population 3 months and 6 months post vaccination.

## 6. Study C4591048 Amendment 5

Study C4591048 Substudy E is a Phase 2/3 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single age-appropriate dose of BNT162b2 (Omi XBB.1.5) in participants ≥ 5 to &lt;12 years of age who are COVID-19 vaccine -naïve.

Approximately 300 participants ≥ 5 to &lt;12 years of age in Group 2 will be enrolled and will receive a single 10μg dose of BNT162b2 (Omi XBB.1.5). Protocol amendment 5 included the removal of Group 1 (participants ≥ 2 to &lt;5 years of age) and a change to the comparator group in the immunogenicity analysis.

- The decision was made to not pursue Substudy E Group 1, as this age group ( ≥ 2 to &lt;5 years) is being evaluated in Substudy A.
- The comparator group for Substudy E participants ≥ 5 to ≥12 years of age immunogenicity analysis has been changed from Study C4591007 to Study C4591054 Substudy A. Study C4591054 -Substudy A has been chosen, as this is a more epidemiologically relevant comparator and allows a more contemporary assessment of hybrid immunity.

## Overall Rationale for the Amendment:

This protocol amendment is predominantly targeted at Substudy E. The comparator study for Substudy E participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years of age has been changed from Study C4591007 to Study C4591054 -Substudy A to conduct noninferiority analysis. Study C4591054 - Substudy A has been chosen, as this is a more epidemiologically relevant comparator and allows a more contemporary assessment of hybrid immunity. Additionally, the decision was made to not pursue Substudy E Group 1, as this age group (≥6 months to &lt;2 years) is being evaluated in Substudy A.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity results were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres on a newly developed 384-well assay platform (reference strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020], and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) at before first study vaccination (Dose 4) and 1 month after study vaccination (Dose 4) with the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μ g for participants enrolled in this study, and reported as GMTs, percentages/difference in percentages with seroresponse, and GMFRs.

A non-validated FFRNT was used to determine Omicron-specific and reference strain neutralizing titres among a subset of BNT162b2-experienced participants 18 through 55 and/or &gt;55 years of age who received a booster (Dose 4) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μ g in C4591044 Cohort 2 and BNT162b2-experienced adults &gt;55 years of age who received a booster (Dose 4) of BNT162b2 30 μ g in C4591031 Substudy E.

Note that the selection of participants from C4591031 Substudy E intentionally included similar proportions of individuals without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection balanced with those who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Assessor´s comment: The aims of the currently presented exploratory immunogenicity analysis were to follow up the antibody persistance over 3 and 6 months post vaccination, to explore cross-neutralizing antibodies to other newly circulating omicron variants and describe the cell- mediated immunity after the vaccination with bivalent original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine. The analyses were descriptive, which was agreed to earlier. The methodology of this study has been assessed during earlier procedures, found to be acceptable and therefore it is not repeated here again.

The Applicant stated, that they have submitted final report for C4591044, but it seems, that more data for Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 may be coming. The MAH has clarified that they do not intend to submit further supplementary clinical study reports unless benefit/risk profile changes, which is acceptable from CHMP side.

## 7.2. Results

## 7.2.1. Immunogenicity populations

## Subset of BNT162b2 Bivalent 30 µg Groups of Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 Combined (Persistence of Response)

This part of the immunogenicity analysis included all participants in Cohort 2/Group 1 (12 through 17 years of age) and subsets of approximately 100 participants in Cohort 2/Group 2 + Cohort 3/Group 1 combined (18 through 55 years of age) and Cohort 2/Group 4 + Cohort 3/Group 2 combined (&gt;55 years of age) who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5 ) 30 μg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For participants 18 through 55 and &gt;55 years of age, 50 participants who were baseline positive and baseline negative in each age group were randomly selected from participants who met other evaluability criteria and had sufficient blood volume at each timepoint.

## Evaluable Immunogenicity Population

The evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 104 participants (97.2%), 100 participants (100.0%), and 100 participants (100.0%) who were 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and &gt;55 years of age, respectively. There were 25 participants (23.4%), 50 participants (50.0%), and 50 participants (50.0%) who were 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and &gt;55 years of age, respectively, without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study vaccination. Three participants (2.8%) 12 through 17 years of age were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population and the most common reason was 'did not have at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days after the study vaccination'.

## 3-Month Evaluable Immunogenicity Population

The 3-month evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 100 participants from each age group. There were 19 participants (17.8%), 47 participants (47.0%), and 45 participants (45.0%) who were 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and &gt;55 years of age, respectively, without evidence of infection up to 3 months after study vaccination. Seven participants (6.5%) 12 through 17 years of age were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population and the most common reason was 'did not have at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result at the 3-month post-study vaccination visit'.

## 6-Month Evaluable Immunogenicity Population

The 6-month evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 98 participants (91.6%) who were 12 through 17 years of age, and 100 participants (100.0%) who were 18 through 55 years of age and &gt;55 years of age, each. Of these participants, there were 10 participants (9.3%), 37 participants (37.0%), and 41 participants (41.0%) who were 12 through 17 years of age, 18 through 55 years of age, and &gt;55 years of age, respectively, without evidence of infection up to 6 months after study vaccination. Nine participants (8.4%) 12 through 17 years of age were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population and the most common reason was 'did not have at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result at the 6-month post-study vaccination visit'.

## Neutralization of Variants in Cohort 2 Subset

## Omicron XBB.1.5

The descriptive neutralization immunogenicity analysis subset included approximately 40 randomised participants per vaccine group. Subsets were selected from participants &gt;55 years of age in C4591044 Cohort 2 who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30 µg (Group 4) and participants &gt;55 years of age group in C4591031 Substudy E Expanded Cohort who received BNT162b2 30 µg. Note that the selection of participants intentionally included similar proportions of individuals without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection balanced with those who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Omicron XBB.1.16 and Omicron CH.1.1

The descriptive new variant neutralization immunogenicity analysis subset for Omicron XBB.1.16 and Omicron CH.1.1 was the same subset described in Section above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## T-cell Responses in PBMC Subset (Cohort 2)

For participants ≥ 18 years of age in Cohort 2, the cell-mediated immune response and additional humoral immune response parameters to the reference strain and Omicron strain (BA.4/BA.5) were summarised at each time point for the subset of participants with PBMC samples collected in each group. All participants who consented to PBMC isolation and HLA typing in Cohort 2 were included in the analysis.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 20 participants (80.0%) 18 through 55 years of age and 20 participants (83.3%) &gt;55 years of age.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 60-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 28 participants (93.3%) 18 through 55 years of age and 16 participants (100.0%) &gt;55 years of age.

## Geometric Mean Titres

## Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization

Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs at prevaccination and 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher for participants who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline positive) compared with those who were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (baseline negative).

Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at prevaccination and 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher in participants 12 through 17 years of age.

Across all age groups within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Observed Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at prevaccination and 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher for participants 12 to 17 compared to participants 18 through 55 years of age and &gt;55 years of age. Within the age group of 12 to 17 years of age, GMTs were generally similar at 1, 3, and 6 months after study vaccination. Within the age groups of 18 through 55 years of age and &gt;55 years of age, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.

## Reference Strain Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs, reference strain GMTs at prevaccination and 1,3, and 6 months after study vaccination were higher for participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, reference strain neutralizing GMTs at prevaccination and 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher in participants 12 through 17 years of age and generally similar for participants 18 through 55 years of age and participants &gt;55 years of age. Across all age groups within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, reference strain neutralizing GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. Within baseline negative groups at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs, reference strain neutralizing GMTs at prevaccination and 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were substantially higher for participants 12 to 17 compared to participants 18 through 55 years of age and &gt;55 years of age and generally similar for participants 18 through 55 years of age and participants &gt;55 years of age. Within the age group of 12 to 17 years of age, GMTs were similar at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination.

Within the age groups of 18 through 55 years of age and &gt;55 years of age, reference strain neutralizing GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.

## Geometric Mean Fold Rises

## Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher for participants who were baseline negative compared with those who were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Within participants who were baseline negative, GMFRs remained high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups, and highest in 12 through 17 years of age.

Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were generally similar for all age groups. GMFRs were highest at 1 month and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, GMFRs remained high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups, particuarly within baseline negative groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Overall, in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMFRs of neutralizing titres from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination for Omicron BA.4/BA.5 were generally similar across all age groups. Across all age groups, GMFRs were highest at 1 month and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, GMFRs remained high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups.

## Reference Strain Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMFRs, reference strain GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were higher for participants who were baseline negative compared with those who were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination were similar for all age groups. GMFRs were highest at 1 month and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, GMFRs remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline negative groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMFRs in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMFRs of neutralizing titres from before study vaccination to 1, 3 and 6 months after study vaccination for the reference strain were similar across all age groups. Across all age groups, GMFRs were highest at 1 month and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, GMFRs remained high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups.

## Seroresponse

## Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Across all age groups, seroresponse rates at 1,3 and 6 months after study vaccination were generally higher for participants who were baseline negative compared to those who were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, seroresponse rates were generally similar across all age groups at 1,3, and 6 months after study vaccination. Seroresponse rates remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups, particularly within baseline negative groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion of participants who achieved a seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at 1 and 3 months after study vaccination was generally similar for all age groups. At 6 months after study vaccination, seroresponse rate was highest in participants 12 through 17 years of age, followed by participants 18 through 55 years of age. Overall, seroresponse rates remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups.

## Reference Strain Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 seroresponse rates, across all age groups, seroresponse rates to the reference strain at 1,3 and 6 months after study vaccination were generally higher for participants who were baseline negative compared to those who were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, seroresponse rates to the reference strain were similar at 1,3, and 6 months after study vaccination in participants 18 through 55 and participants &gt;55 years of age. Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, the observed proportion of participants 12 through 17 years of age achieving seroresponse to the reference strain was similar or slightly lower at 1, 3, and 6 months after study vaccination compared to participants 18 through 55 and participants &gt;55 years of age. Seroresponse rates remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups, within baseline negative groups.

Results for participants with or without evidence of infection in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion of participants who achieved a seroresponse to the reference strain at 1,3 and 6 months after study vaccination was generally similar for all age groups. Overall, seroresponse rates remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups.

Assessor´s comment: The persistent antibody level was observed up to 6 months post vaccination in all age groups regardless of the baseline COVID-19 experience status. The adolescent group demonstrated higher neutralizing antibody levels than adults and older adults as expected. All participants had high a level of neutralizing antibodies against wt strain at the baseline due to the recent vaccination (less than 1 year ago) with Original vaccine. The seroresponse rate, defined as percentage of participants achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination) at each timepoint after vaccination (or postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ if the baseline measurement was below LLOQ), depends of the baseline antibody level. If the baseline antibody level is already high, it is not biologically possible to reach 4 fold rise after the vaccination. Therefore seroresponse rate is not very informative in case of booster vaccination.

## Geometric Mean Titres

## Omicron XBB.1.5 Neutralization

## Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection

Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of prior SARSCoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the study vaccination (all participants): The observed GMTs at 1month postdose against Omicron variant XBB.1.5 were higher in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg group compared to the BNT162b2 30-µg group for all participants and within the baseline positive and baseline negative groups.

Among both vaccine groups in the evaluable immunogenicity population, GMTs (against XBB.1.5 or against BA.4/BA.5) at predose and 1-month postdose were higher for participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline positive) compared with those without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline negative).

Similar results were observed for participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the all-available immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the study vaccination:

- The observed GMTs at 1-month postdose against Omicron XBB.1.5 were higher in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg group compared to the BNT162b2 30-µg group.
- Despite different intervals from dose 3 to 4, the pre-dose 4 neutralizing titres against Omicron XBB.1.5 were similar for the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg and BNT162b2 30-µg vaccine groups.

BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg group compared to the BNT162b2 30-µg group for all participants and within the baseline positive and baseline negative groups.

Among both vaccine groups in the evaluable immunogenicity population, GMTs (against XBB.1.16, CH.1.1, or BA.4/BA.5) at pre-dose and 1 month post dose were higher for participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline positive) compared with those without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline negative).

Similar results were observed for participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the all-available immunogenicity population.

## Participants Without Evidence of Infection

Among participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the study vaccination:

- The observed GMTs at 1-month post dose against Omicron variant XBB.1.16 and Omicron CH.1.1 were higher in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg group compared to the BNT162b2 30-µg group.
- Despite different intervals from dose 3 to 4, the pre-dose 4 neutralizing titres against Omicron variant XBB.1.16 and CH.1.1 were similar for the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4.5) 30-µg and BNT162b2 30-µg vaccine groups.

Assessor´s comment: The FFRNT assay is a non-validated nautralization assay. Geometric Mean Fold Rises and seroresponses for Omicron XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and CH.1.1 was shown by the applicant, but are not presented in this AR as the GMTs for these types were very low indicating no cross-neutralization for these types. The cross-neutralizing antibody level against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and CH.1.1 were so low, that no clinically important protection against Covid-19 caused by these types is expected after the bivalent Original/Omi BA.4-5 vaccination.

## HLA Type

All participants &gt;18 years of age in Cohort 2 who consented to PBMC isolation and HLA typing were included in the Cohort 2 PBMC subset population.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 20 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 20 participants &gt;55 years of age. The majority of participants 18 through 55 and &gt;55 years of age (75.0% and 90.0%, respectively) had an HLA allele of DPA1*01:03:01G.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 60-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of 28 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 16 participants &gt;55 years of age. The majority of participants 18 through 55 (89.3%) and all participants &gt;55 years of age had an HLA allele of DPA1*01:03:01G.

## Immunogenicity Conclusions

## Persistence of Immune Response: BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30 µg

Analysis of immunogenicity data at 6 months after vaccination in a subset of BNT162b2-experienced participants 12 through 17, 18 through 55, and &gt;55 years of age with or without evidence of prior SARSCoV-2 infection from Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 combined who received a booster (Dose 4) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30 µg demonstrated a persistent vaccine-elicited immune response through 6 months after study vaccination.

- Increased neutralizing responses with BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) were observed regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection status, with the greatest GMFRs observed in participants without prior infection and the higher neutralizing titres observed in participants with prior infection.
- Across all age groups within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.
- Within baseline negative groups at the 6-month timepoint, reference strain neutralizing GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups.
- Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and reference strain GMFRs were highest at 1 month and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMFRs remained

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline negative and baseline positive groups. Reference strain GMFRs remained high up to 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline negative groups.

- Seroresponse rates to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline negative and baseline positive groups. Seroresponse rates to the reference strain remained high at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline negative groups. Seroresponse rates to the reference strain were lowest at 6 months after study vaccination across all age groups within baseline positive groups.

## Neutralization of Variants: BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30μg

The cross-neutralization antibody levels against Omicron XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and CH.1.1 were very low after ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5 vaccination.

## T-Cell Responses (Cohort 2)

Frequencies of CD4+ T-cells secreting 2 of 3 Th1 cytokines (IL-2, TNF α , IFN γ ) in response to S1, S2, unique Omicron WT and unique Omicron BA.4/BA.5 pools generally peaked at 1 week post vaccination increased slightly post-Dose 1 and remained unchanged at all other timepoints. This trend was observed across both age groups and dose levels. IFN γ CD107a producing CD8 T-cells also produced a similar pattern. Finally, there was a skewing of the CD4 T-cell population towards IFN γ production rather than IL-4, suggesting a Th1-biased response. Th1 cells are responsible for mediating a cellular immune response to virally infected cells, such as SARS-CoV-2.

On comparison of the 2 doses utilized in this study (BNT162b2 Bivalent [ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5 ] 30 μg or 60 μg), both doses consistently yielded similar GMFRs for CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells secreting IFN γ Additionally, across both doses and age groups, the magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response to spike pool 1 was higher than that to spike pool 2.

## 7.3. Discussion

In the current application, immunogenicity data from study C4591044 , where the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4-5) was given as the fourth dose (second booster) in participant ≥ 12 years of age. The 1 month post booster data was evaluated earlier. The aims of the currently presented exploratory immunogenicity analysis were to follow up the antibody persistance over 3 and 6 months post vaccination, to explore cross- neutralizing antibodies to other newly circulating omicron variants and describe the cell- mediated immunity after the vaccination with bivalent original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine. The analysis were descriptive, which was agreed to earlier. The methodology of this study has been assessed during earlier procedures, found to be acceptable and therefore it is not repeated here again.

Persistent antibody levels were observed up to 6 months post vaccination in all age groups regardless of baseline Covid-19 experience status. The adolescent group demonstrated higher neutralizing antibody levels than adults and older adults as expected. All participants had high a level of neutralizing antibodies against Wt strain at the baseline due to the recent vaccination (less than 1 year ago) with Original vaccine. GMTs were observed to be highest at 1 month after study vaccination and gradually decreased at 3 and 6 months after study vaccination. However, at the 6-month timepoint, GMTs were still considerably higher than the baseline value across all age groups. The seroresponse rate, defined as percentage of participants achieving a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination) at each timepoint after vaccination (or postvaccination assay result ≥ 4 × LLOQ if the baseline measurement was below LLOQ), depends of the baseline antibody level. If the baseline antibody level is already high, it is not biologically

possible to reach 4 fold rise after the vaccination. Therefore, seroresponse rate is not very informative in case of booster vaccination.

The non-validated FFRNT assay was used to evaluate cross-neutralizing responses to Omicron XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and CH.1.1. The GMTs for these types were very low indicating no cross-neutralization for these types. No clinically important protection against Covid-19 caused by these types is expected after the bivalent Original/Omi BA.4-5 vaccination.

T-cell responses generally peaked at 1 week post vaccination increased slightly post-Dose 1 and remained unchanged at all other timepoints. This trend was observed across both age groups and dose levels.

There was a skewing of the CD4 T-cell population towards IFNγ production rather than IL -4, suggesting a Th1-biased response. This is an expected result as Th1 cells are responsible for mediating a cellular immune response to virally infected cells, such as SARS-CoV-2.

In conclusion, the bivalent Original/Omi BA4-5 induced sustainable level of neutralizing antibodies specific to Omi BA4-5 and Wt up to 6 months post booster. The highest T- cell responses peaked 1 week post booster and indicated Th1-biased response. The cross-neutralizing antibodies to other relevant Omicron variants were very low and no protection against these is expected after the WT/OMI BA4-5 booster.

Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events (eg, fatigue, injection site pain or erythema, chills, headache), and included lymphadenopathy.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30μg groups, 11 participants (10.3%) 12 through 17 years of age, 26 participants (8.3%) 18 through 55 years of age, and 33 participants (10.8%) &gt;55 years of age, reported any AE:

- Of the 11 participants 12 through 17 years of age who reported an AE, the SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was general disorders and administration site conditions (3.7%). All other SOCs were reported by 1.9% of participants or less.
- Of the 26 participants 18 through 55 years of age who reported an AE, the SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was blood and lymphatic system disorders (2.6%) followed by infections and infestations (1.6%) and general disorders and
- administration site conditions (1.3%). The most commonly reported PT in the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC was lymphadenopathy and was reported by 6 participants (1.9%).
- Of the 33 participants &gt;55 years of age who reported an AE, the SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was musculoskeletal and connective tissue orders (2.6%), followed by infections and infestations (2.0%). One participant reported an AE of elevated troponin 22 days after study vaccination and was evaluated for potential myocarditis/pericarditis. Troponin T and ECG results were both abnormal and echo was normal. The AE was not considered to be myocarditis/pericarditis and was assessed as not related to study vaccination by the investigator.

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 60μg groups, 12 participants (10.9%) 18 through 55 years of age and 14 participants (13.7%) &gt;55 years of age reported any AE:

- Of the 12 participants 18 through 55 years of age who reported an AE, the SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was infections and infestations (2.7%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (1.8%), and reproductive system and breast disorders (1.8%).
- Of the 14 participants &gt;55 years of age who reported an AE, the SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was injury, poisoning and procedural complications and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.9% each) followed by infections and infestations (2.0%). One participant reported an AE of dyspnea 20 days after study vaccination that lasted for 2 days and was evaluated for potential myocarditis/pericarditis. Troponin T and ECG results were both normal. The AE was not considered to be myocarditis/pericarditis and was assessed as not related to study vaccination by the investigator.

## Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 30μg groups, 1 participant (0.9%) 12 through 17 years of age, 3 participants (1.0%) 18 through 55 years of age, and 10 participants (3.3%) &gt;55 years of age, reported a severe or life-threatening AE.

- The participant 12 through 17 years of age reported severe AEs of alcohol poisoning and suicidal ideation. These severe events were also SAEs. No life-threatening AEs were reported.
- Of the 3 participants 18 through 55 years of age who reported a severe or life-threatening AE, 1 participant (0.3%) each reported severe AEs of diverticulitis, hypertension, and hypotension. The 2 severe events of diverticulitis and hypotension were also SAEs. No life-threatening AEs were reported.
- Of the 10 participants &gt;55 years of age who reported a severe or life-threatening AE, all PTs were reported by 1 participant (0.3%) each. The most commonly reported SOCs were metabolism and nutrition disorders and neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps), with each reported by 3 participants (1.0%). All severe AEs were classified as SAEs (except for fall, head injury, ligament rupture, and muscle rupture). One participant (0.3%) reported a lifethreatening AE of left ventricular failure (see section death).

For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (ORIGINAL/OMI BA.4-.5) 60μg groups, 1 participant (0.9%) 18 through 55 years of age reported a severe SAE of testicular germ cell cancer. No participants &gt;55 years of age reported a severe or life-threatening AE.

## Deaths

One death was reported from the study vaccination through 6 months after study vaccination. This participant was 71 years of age with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. On D69 after vaccination (WT/OMI BA.45 at 30 μg) the participant underwent surgery for removal of benign bladder tumour and during the surgery a left ventricular failure was developed, and a stent placement was executed. About 3 weeks after the surgery the participant died due to cardiac failure. In the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, there was no reasonable possibility that the left ventricular failure was related to the study intervention.

Variants of concern for the first COVID-19 occurrence are summarised below:

- Among the determinate and quantifiable sequence results for COVID-19 occurrences reported in participants 12 through 17 years of age (n=4), lineage for the cases were identified as BA.4.6 (Omicron) (n= 1 [25.0%]), BF.7 (Omicron) (n= 1 [25.0%]), BQ.1.1.41 (Omicron) (n=1 [25.0%]), and XBB.1.5 (Omicron) (n= 1 [25.0%]).
- Among the determinate and quantifiable sequence results for COVID-19 cases reported in participants 18 through 55 years of age (n=28), the most frequently determined lineage was identified as XBB.1.5 (Omicron) (n= 4 [14.3%]) and 3 cases (10.7%) were unknown, which also included indeterminate results and nonquantifiable or not sequenced samples. Other Omicron variants were reported by 2 participants (7.1%) or less.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Among the determinate and quantifiable sequence results for COVID-19 cases reported in participants &gt;55 years of age (n=19), the most frequently determined lineage was identified as XBB.1.5 (Omicron) (n= 3 [15.8%]).

## 8.3. Discussion

This report includes AEs and SAEs reported from study vaccination through 6 months vaccination. Methods and safety data for participants who received a 30 or 60μg dose of BNT162b2 Original/BA.4 -5) as Dose 4, including local reactions and systemic events recorded in the e-diary for 7 days after vaccination through 1 month after study vaccination were previously described in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G.

During the reporting interval, any AEs were reported in 10-14% of the participants. Among these events, 2-5% were considered related to study vaccination. The participants aged &gt;55 years reported the lowest frequency of related AEs (2%). Most of the related AEs were consistent with reactogenicity and PTs already included in the SmPC.

In total reported 13 participants SAEs. One participant in the age group reported alcohol poisoning, among the subjects aged 18-&lt;55 years one participant reported diverticulitis and another hypotension. Nine participants aged &gt;55 years reported SAEs which included arrhythmia, post procedural infection, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, adenocarcinoma pancreas, leukemia, prostate cancer, and urinary tract obstruction. One participant aged &gt;55 years died due to left ventricular failure. None of these events were considered related to study vaccination.

No cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were reported up to 6 months after study vaccination.

No new safety concern was identified.

A total of 68 participants reported covid-19 occurrence. Overall, the most frequently determined lineage was identified as XBB.1.5 (Omicron) which reflects the epidemiological situation of covid-19 at that time.

## 9. Risk management plan

On 24 September 2024 the MAH submitted an updated RMP version 13.1 (dated 22 September 2024) with this application.

Following liaising with EMA and PRAC Rapporteur, the MAH submitted on 15 November 2024 an updated RMP version 13.2 (dated 08 November 2024) alongside a corresponding justification document

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

addressing a request for a 9 month extension for the final CSR for study C4591021 (see below).

The MAH provided the following rationale for submitting an updated RMP:

- -To remove the following completed studies/milestones from Part III.2, Part V and Annexes as applicable, for which the final CSRs have been submitted to EMA: C4591007, C4591015, C4591024, C4591031 SSE, C4591044, C4591014, and WI255886.
- -To remove milestone of study C4591051 due to study termination as per PRAC's PAM-MEA-064.3 outcome.
- -New milestone, key objectives, design and study population of interventional study C4591048 (a master phase 1/2/3 protocol to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of bivalent BNT162b2 RNA-based vaccine candidate(s) in healthy children) were aligned according to Protocol Amendment (PA)#5.
- -C4591038 final CSR milestone change from 30 September 2024 to 30 June 2025 as per ongoing PAMMEA-047.5 procedure.
- -New milestone for CSR submission of study C4591021 was updated due to the need to collect all necessary data and conduct analyses and quality control checks for the final study report. Whereas all data were extracted, and variables created, the end of data collection requires further time to be completed for the reasons outlined in the corresponding justification document.

- b.Vaccine effectiveness isnot a safety concern.

a.Based on the outcome of procedures PAM MEA 015.2 and PAM MEA 016, and in particular based on the conclusions-of theAssessmentReport for thePostAuthorisationMeasureMEA/015.2and MEA/016 (EMA/CHMP/498689/2021) issued on 16 September 2021, the design of study C4591024 was-agreed to satisfactorily cover the objectives initially planned for study C4591018, that is therefore removed from the list of studies

c.The study does not involve any administration of vaccine or otherPfizer products but since a specimen collection procedure is required per protocol, this qualifies this study as \"low-interventional'.

d.United Kingdom.

Study BNT162 01 was completed and final CSR was submitted on 07 August 2023 (Procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0187).

Study C4591001 was completed, and final CSR is submitted on 09 August 2023 (Procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0188/G).

## 9.2.2.1. Justification for the extension of final study report for study C4591021

The MAH requests a 9-month extension for submission of the final study report for C4591021: Post Conditional Approval Active Surveillance Study Among Individuals in Europe Receiving the PfizerBioNTech Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine.

As noted in protocol amendment version 7.0, (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0206/G, CHMP Opinion 13 June 2024), the original due date for submission of the final study report was 20 December 2024 with a study completion date (i.e., end of data collection) of 30 September 2024. With the extension being requested, the revised due date for submission of the final study report will be 30 September 2025 with a revised study completion date (i.e., end of data collection) of 31 March 2025.

The reason for requiring this extension is due to the need to collect all necessary data and conduct analyses and quality control checks for the final study report. Whereas all data were extracted, and variables created the end of data collection date (i.e., the availability of the entire final analytical data set) requires further time to complete for the reasons outlined below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Validation of anaphylaxis and major congenital anomalies
- o The identification of cases of anaphylaxis and major congenital anomalies can only occur once the Data Expert and Access Partners (DEAPs) run the final, quality-controlled scripts. When these scripts return the patient identification numbers from the matched study cohorts, the DEAPs must then request patient records from healthcare providers, which are necessary for the validation process. Information from the records needs to be extracted to estimate the level of certainty of the cases. Currently, the DEAPs are running the scripts, however, the complex extraction of the information from medical records is still pending collection. It is estimated that an additional 6 months is needed to fully complete this activity.
- Calculation of confidence intervals for the risk differences.
- o Due to resampling of non-vaccinated persons, calculation of 95% confidence intervals for the risk differences requires bootstrapping. Bootstrapping requires repeating the sampling and matching of the cohort 200 times. The size of the Pfizer/BioNTech cohort (approximately 12 million vaccinees) makes this challenging from both software and hardware capacity perspectives. Some of the data sources may need to change their servers due to the large size of the cohort. It is estimated that an additional 6 months is needed to allow sufficient time to complete the calculation of the confidence intervals for the risk differences in all the data sources.

In summary, the MAH requests a 9-month extension for the final study report for C4591021. This extension also requires extending the study completion date by 6 months. The revised due date for submission of the final study report will be 30 September 2025 with a revised study completion date (i.e., end of data collection) of 31 March 2025.

The final study report for C4591021 will be delivered within 6 months of the study completion date, which still enable the MAH to meet the Article 46 regulation.

## PRAC Rapporteur comment :

The MAH requests a 9-month extension for the final study report for study C4591021 (formerly named ACCESS/VAC4EU) due to the need to collect all necessary data and conduct analyses and quality control checks for the final study report. According to the MAH all data were extracted, and variables created, however the availability of the entire final analytical data set requires further time to complete. The reasons outlined above are acknowledged. Therefore the final study report submission milestone will be changed from 20 December 2024 to 30 September 2025. Given the argumentation provided by the MAH for the requested extension and the results presented in the previous interim reports (see below), this is accepted.

## Study C4591021 background information

Study C4591021, an ongoing non-interventional PASS, is a Comirnaty safety surveillance study conducted in collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of Vaccine Monitoring Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU and based on the master surveillance protocol. The primary study objective is to determine whether an increased risk of prespecified adverse events of special interest (AESI) exists following the administration of at least one dose of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine using two approaches: (i) a cohort design comparing risk in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and (ii) a self- controlled risk interval (SCRI) design.

To date, results of the 5 th  interim report were assessed in MEA 17.9 (AR circulated 16 May 2024) describing the characteristics and incidence rates for 37 AESIs in more than 12 million vaccinated individuals and 12 million matched unvaccinated controls: PRAC Rapporteur concluded that no additional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

characterisation of the AESI's were warranted and no new important safety information was identified. Note that in variation application procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0206/G Protocol Amendment (PA) 5, version 7 and SAP Amendment 3, version 5.0 were assessed and considered acceptable (UAR circulated 10 June 2024). In PA#4 (18 October 2023) the final study report milestone was 3 months extended to 20 December 2024.

## 9.3. Overall conclusion on the RMP

The changes to the RMP are acceptable.
