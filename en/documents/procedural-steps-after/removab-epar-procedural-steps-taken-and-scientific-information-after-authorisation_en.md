| II/0016/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include new information from an integrated safety analysis based on data from study IP-CAT-AC-03, and update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with new clinical information from Studies IP-AT-AC-03 and -04. Additionally, information on liver enzyme increase following the assessment report of PSUR-4 has been reinserted in section 4.8 of the SmPC Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8 rev 2 and to implement minor editorial changes. The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal | 13/12/2012 product | 18/12/2013 no longer | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | An updated integrated safety analysis from the clinical study IP-CAT-AC-03 comprised of 728 patients was submitted as part of the current variation. The safety profile was considered comparable to the well-known safety profile of catumaxumab. The efficacy results in terms of puncture-free survival , puncture-free time and overall survival were comparable to the outcome of the pivotal trial. In Study 03, premedication with prednisolone did not improve safety and did not negatively affect efficacy. This information was been included in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC respectively. The results of the clinical study IP-CAT-AC-04, were also submitted as part of the current variation. These data demonstrate that despite the presence of anti-drug antibodies, a safety profile comparable in terms of nature but less severe compared to the first i.p. treatment cycle is observed. Furthermore patients benefit in terms of puncture-free survival, puncture-free time and overall survival. This information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Information on liver enzyme increase following the assessment report of PSUR-4 has been reinserted in section 4.8 of the SmPC. authorised |

Overall, an increased frequency of some adverse reactions was seen in relation to the 3-hour administration, which required an update of the frequency of adverse events in the SmPC. The benefit attributed to a reduced infusion time is reduced time spent at hospital, which was considered acceptable on a case by case basis. In more fragile patients, it was recommended that the 6h option for the first infusion be |
