Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects In been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of te c conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having n on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects C toxicological  properties  are  well (c hydrogensulphate). A summary of the literature information on non-clinical data of clopidogrel and the  results  of  two  new  non-clinical  studies  (acute  and  chronic  toxicity)  conducted  with  clopidogrel hydrochloride  were  provided.  Furthermore,  on  the  basis  of  the  CHMP  Guidance  for  users  of  the centralised  procedure  for  generic  application  (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006),  when  different  salts  of the  active  substance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  are  used,  additional  information  providing proof that their non-clinical safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal  product  is  needed.  Thus,  information  that  the  different  clopidogrel  salt  (clopidogrel hydrochloride)  does  not  differ  significantly  in  non-clinical  properties  with  regards  to  safety  and efficacy  of  the  reference  product  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  in  accordance  with  the  relevant guideline. Medicinal product no longer authorised lopidogrel  hydrochloride vs clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity tudy  reports  were  in  accordance  with  GLP  standards  and  regulatory  guidelines  (please  see  section The  response  referred  to  the  results  of  the  toxicity  and  genotoxicity  studies  to  examine  the  safety profile  of  c s Toxicology ).  The  13-week  toxicity  study  report  did  not  detect  major  differences  in  the  same  safety profile for the hydrochloride and hydrogen sulphate salt; liver was determined as the target organ in both salts. Regarding the genotoxicity testing, clopidogrel hydrochloride tested at a higher concentration level than clopidogrel hydrogen  sulphate, turned to be not clastogenic in the chromosome aberration test. In the micronucleus test, at the same dose levels, neither the hydrogen sulphate  salt  nor  the  hydrochloride  salt  was  found  clastogenic/aneugenic.  Thus,  based  on  the  data provided,  similar  safety  profile  was  demonstrated  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  and  clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate.

## Toxicology

Two new non-clinical studies were conducted with clopidogrel hydrochloride.

## ingle-dose toxicity S

. Results of single dose xicity  studies  in  rats  revealed  low  toxicity  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  at  doses  10,  100,  1000 igns  of  toxicity  and  mortality  were  reported  in  rats  after  the  administration  of The acute toxicity study on rats was performed with clopidogrel hydrochloride to mg/kg.  No  clinical  s drug. No significant differences in body weight gain were seen between the control and treated groups. At  terminal  necropsy,  no  apparent  macroscopic  changes  attributed  to  clopidogrel  hydrochloride administration were observed in any animal. The majority of tissue was macroscopically unremarkable. LD50 values were over 1500mg /kg for both sexes.

jection with respect to the studies on impurities, which did do ot  follow  recommendations  of  the  OECD  guideline,  protocol  471  ( OECD,  1997,  Test  Guideline Although  the in  vitro studies  did  not  reveal  any  mutagenic,  genotoxic  or  clastogenic  potential  of clopidogrel, the CHMP raised a major ob n 47:Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test.

In response, adequately conducted reverse mutation assays in accordance with GLP standards and OECD guideline protocol number 471 was provided. The results of the Ames test performed with potassium ethyl  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  isopropyl  sulphate indicated  that  these two substances do not hold a mutagenic potential. Thus, the content limit for monoalkylsulphates as proposed by the applicant is acceptable to the CHMP.

The study was conducted with four groups of 10 males and one vehicle control group and 3 test groups receiving 12.5, 125 or 250 mg/kg a  typhimurium reverse  mutation  assays  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was erformed  and  revealed  evidence  that  clopidogrel  did  not  induce  effects  at  either  the  gene  or levels. In Ames test of clopidogrel's main metabolite S-carboxylic acid derivative was After a single oral administration of clopidogrel in mice, rats and baboons, toxicity occurred only at very high doses and the target organs were mainly the gastrointes T Repeated-dose toxicity The toxicity of clopidogrel hydrochloride was investigated in rats u g 10 females each versus body weight/day. Treatment with clopidogrel hydrochloride was generally well tolerated, based on the lack of treatment related clinical signs and the normal growth of the animals. Some treatment related changes  in  haematology,  e.g.  thrombocytes,  and  clinical  chemistry,  e.g.  cholesterol,  triglycerides, bilirubin,  total  protein,  etc.,  were  revealed.  Decreased  thymus  weights,  increased  adrenal,  kidney, seminal vesicles and liver weights and hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes were also observed. The  no-observed-adverse-effect  level  (NOAEL)  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was  considered  12.5 mg/kg body weight/day. There appears to be no additional toxic effects of clopidogrel hydrochloride although no direct comparative data between the clopidogrel hydrochloride and clopidogrel hydrogensulphate were provided. Furthermore, any potential differences in the non-clinical toxicokinetic  profile  would  be  apparent  in  the  clinical  pharmacokinetic  profile  addressed  by  the bioequivalence studies. Genotoxicity The in  vitro  Salmonell p chromosome also negative. The eventual mutagenic activity of clopidogrel hydrochloride was investigated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA 1535 and  TA102,  without  and  with  metabolic  activation.  The  tested  substance  was  considered  non mutagenic. Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in micronucleus test in mice. Incidence of micronucleated polychromatic red blood cells (RBs) was not elevated in mice received clopidogrel at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg daily, for three consecutive days. Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic RBCs was also normal which indicates that there was no bone marrow cytotoxicity. There was no evidence of any clastogenic activity for clopidogrel.

Since the application concerns generics of respective iscussion on Clinical aspects ne clinical bioequivalence trial 07-197 was provided for Clopidogrel Dura application, analysing the her discussion on the comparability of the fficacy  and  safety  profiles  of  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was ssolution, adverse events profile and other clinical data were onsidered and it was concluded that the two salts of clopidogrel have a comparable safety/efficacy e  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  active  metabolite  is  still  not  well  established,  the  CHMP ccepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data in study 07-197. T legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the mark  R reference  medicinal  products  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk  minimization activities have been identified, this considered acceptable. D O parent prodrug clopidogrel. The demonstration of the unchanged safety/efficacy profile of clopidogrel hydrochloride when compared with Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate) was raised by the CHMP as a major issue for this generic product. In response, furt e provided. Pharmacokinetics, di c profile. At  the  time  of  approval  of  the  reference  product  Plavix,  there  was  no  reliable  and  validated methodology for the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the non-active metabolite.  In the meantime, a reliable bioanalytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine was developed. Since  th a Thus,  data  related  to  pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  are  considered  supportive, whereas data on clopidogrel parent drug is important for the confirmation of bioequivalence. The indication of Clopidogrel Dura is different from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see section 2.1). Thus, the Product Information has been adequately amended to reflect this change and this is considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised inf, might e  increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions re  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUC b presented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification of  this  approach  and  adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be demonstrated only under fasting condition a Bioequivalence Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) document as the drug product is to be administered  under  fasting  as  well  as  fed  conditions.  In  addition  to  the  dissolution  studies  using clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate,  conducted  at  three  different  pH  values  (1.2,  4.5,  6.8),  the  applicant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provided an additional in vivo bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions. The comparative in vitro dissolution studies under conditions mimicking  the  fed state as well the fed state bioequivalence  study  did  not  reveal  any  major  differences  when  compared  to  the  reference  drug product.

The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the bioequivalence  studies  included  validation  with  the  analysis  of  calibration  curves  and  controls  at various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the quantitatively  major metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid to the parent drug. Considering that the plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel lasma levels and would bias the outcome of the bioequivalence study. The back-conversion could trial. e  recommended  80-125%  range  for  clopidogrel,  required  by  the  above entioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel C to p occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the presence  of  methanol.  In  order  to  avoid  this  process,  the  extraction  procedure  was  changed  and methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed in  order  to  prove  the  reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  clopidogrel  concentration  measurements,  the CHMP  questioned  these  results  since  no  clear  description  of  the  analytical  technique  including extraction procedure actually used in the initial pre-study validation process was  provided. Information on the validation procedures in study 07-197 was requested by the CHMP. In response, details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, no  source  of  methylation  exists  within  the  entire  methodology,  including  all  solution  preparation, plasma sample processing,  handling  storage  and  LC-MS/MS determination. The CHMP considered this issue resolved. Considering the above difficulties in the determination of clopidogrel in plasma especially the issue related  to  the  possible  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  to  the  parent  drug,  a  triggered  GCP inspection of the bioequivalence study was requested by the CHMP, which was of the opinion that results  of  this  inspection  and  the  satisfactory  responses  to  its  findings  were  an  integral  part  of  the evaluation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the overall results of the The  bioequivalence  study  07-197  and  its  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these parameters  were  within  th m max 75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, since the confidence intervals for Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the intervals was not applicable.
