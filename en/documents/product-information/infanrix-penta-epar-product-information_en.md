PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection Infanrix Penta is a turbid white suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Infanrix Penta is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and poliomyelitis. Posology and method of administration Posology

## Primary vaccination:

The primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses of 0.5 ml (such as 2, 3, 4 months; 3, 4, 5 months; 2, 4, 6 months) or two doses (such as 3, 5 months). There should be an interval of at least 1 month between doses.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae

) by recombinant DNA technology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Expanded Program on Immunisation schedule (at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) may only be used if a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth.

Locally established immunoprophylactic measures against hepatitis B should be maintained.

Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Infanrix Penta can be used as a replacement for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of six weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used.

<!-- image -->

Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Booster vaccination: After a vaccination with 2 doses (e.g. 3, 5 months) of Infanrix Penta a booster dose must be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose, preferably between 11 and 13 months of age. After vaccination with 3 doses (e.g. 2, 3, 4 months; 3, 4, 5 months; 2, 4, 6 months) of Infanrix Penta a booster dose must be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and preferably before 18 months of age. Booster doses should be given in accordance with the official recommendations. Infanrix Penta can be considered for the booster if the composition is in accordance with the official recommendations. Paediatric population There is no relevant use of Infanrix Penta in children over 36 months. Method of administration Infanrix Penta is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably at alternating sites for subsequent injections. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients or neomycin and polymyxin. Hypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B or polio vaccines. Infanrix Penta is contraindicated if the infant has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination should be continued with diphtheria-tetanus, hepatitis B and polio vaccines. As with other vaccines, administration of Infanrix Penta should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. Special warnings and precautions for use

If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussiscontaining vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be carefully considered:

- Temperature of ≥ 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode) within 48 hours of vaccination;
- Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination;
- Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.

As for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Infanrix Penta or deferring this vaccination should be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe neurological disorder.

Medicinal product no longer authorised As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Infanrix Penta should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. Infanrix Penta should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. Infanrix Penta will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , Bordetella pertussis , hepatitis B virus or poliovirus. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Infanrix Penta. Vaccinees with a history of febrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination. HIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Clinical studies have demonstrated that Infanrix Penta can be administered simultaneously with Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines. In these clinical studies, the injectable vaccines were given at different injection sites. There are no data with regard to the efficacy and safety of simultaneous administration of Infanrix Penta and Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine.

As with other vaccines, it may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy an adequate response may not be achieved.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

As Infanrix Penta is not intended for use in adults, adequate human data on use during pregnancy or lactation and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

- Clinical trials

Uncommon: diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint*

Medicinal product no longer authorised The safety profile presented below is based on data from more than 10,000 subjects. In virtually all instances, Infanrix Penta was administered at the same time as a Hib vaccine. As has been observed for DTPa and DTPa-containing combinations, an increase in local reactogenicity and fever was reported after booster vaccination with Infanrix Penta with respect to the primary course. -Tabulated summary of adverse reactions (clinical trials): Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies per dose are defined as follows: Very common: ( ≥ 1/10) Common: ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon: ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare: ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare: (&lt;1/10,000) Nervous system disorders: Uncommon: somnolence Very rare: convulsions (with or without fever) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Uncommon: cough Gastrointestinal disorders: Common: diarrhoea, vomiting Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon: dermatitis, rash Very rare: urticaria Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common: appetite lost General disorders and administration site conditions: Very common: fever ≥ 38°C, local swelling at the injection site ( ≤ 50 mm), fatigue, pain, redness Common: fever &gt;39.5°C, local swelling at the injection site (&gt; 50 mm)*, injection site reactions, including induration

Medicinal product no longer authorised † cut-off accepted as indicative of protection Percentage of subjects with antibody titres ≥ assay cut-off one month after booster vaccination with Infanrix Penta N = number of subjects † cut-off accepted as indicative of protection As the immune response to pertussis antigens following Infanrix Penta administration is equivalent to that of Infanrix, the protective efficacy of the two vaccines is expected to be equivalent. The clinical protection of the pertussis component of Infanrix, against WHO-defined typical pertussis ( ≥ 21 days of paroxysmal cough) was demonstrated in: a prospective blinded household contact study performed in Germany (3, 4, 5 months schedule). Based on data collected from secondary contacts in households where there was an index case with typical pertussis, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was 88.7%.

- -a NIH sponsored efficacy study performed in Italy (2, 4, 6 months schedule). The vaccine efficacy was found to be 84%. In a follow-up of the same cohort, the efficacy was confirmed up to 60 months after completion of primary vaccination without administration of a booster dose of pertussis.

Results of long term follow-up in Sweden demonstrate that acellular pertussis vaccines are efficacious in infants when administered according to the 3 and 5 months primary vaccination schedule, with a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

booster dose administered at approximately 12 months. However, data indicate that protection against pertussis may be waning at 7-8 years of age with this 3-5-12 months schedule. This suggests that a second booster dose of pertussis vaccine is warranted in children aged 5-7 years who have previously been vaccinated following this particular schedule.

Protective antibodies against hepatitis B have been shown to persist for at least 3.5 years in more than 90% of children administered four doses of a combined vaccine containing the same HBs antigen as Infanrix Penta. Antibody levels were not different from what was observed in a parallel cohort administered 4 doses of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. · This vaccine has been prescribed for your child.

Further information 1. WHAT INFANRIX PENTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Infanrix Penta is a vaccine used to protect your child again five diseases: · Diphtheria a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. The airways become swollen causing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. · Tetanus - tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters in them. The bacteria release a poison. This can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. · Whooping cough (Pertussis) - a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a 'whooping' sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death. · Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in body fluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva) of infected people. · Polio a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness. However, sometimes it can be very serious and cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to move (paralysis). This includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected by the disease may be painfully twisted (deformed).
