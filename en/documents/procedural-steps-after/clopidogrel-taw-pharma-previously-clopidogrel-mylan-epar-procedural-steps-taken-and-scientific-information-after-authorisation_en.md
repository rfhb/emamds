No literature review on the efficacy/effectiveness has been submitted by the MAH within this application. Since the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in the approved indications is well established and evidence of clinical efficacy has been discussed at time of approval the CHMP finds acceptable the MAH approach of not performing a literature review on the efficacy/effectiveness of clopidogrel. The beneficial effect of Clopidogrel Mylan remains in line with that of the originator product (Plavix), and is considered positive. |

In addition, section 4.8 has been amended with minor details on the CURE study. Additional changes have been added to the SmPC and Package Leaflet in order to bring it in line with the revised QRD template (version 7.3) In addition, the deletion of DDPS number 1.3 and dated 21 April 2008 was introduced in Annex IIB as requested by the EMA with the procedural announcement in October and November 2010.   |
