## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pembrolizumab, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Sarcoidosis is a condition involving the development and accumulation of granulomas; compact, centrally organised collections of macrophages and epithelioid cells encircled by lymphocytes. The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. However, any organ can be affected.

The MAH identified a total of 16 cases of sarcoidosis including 13 which were serious. Using the case definition of a compatible clinical presentation, non-caseating granuloma(s) on biopsy and exclusion of other diagnoses, 9 cases met the case definition. There is a biological plausibility for the occurrence of sarcoidosis (an immune-related reaction), and for products with similar mechanism of action [Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab)] sarcoidosis is already listed. Furthermore, given the seriousness of the event and the fact that sarcoidosis may be misdiagnosed as disease progression, it is thought that treating physicians should be aware of the possibility that sarcoidosis can occur during the treatment of pembrolizumab.

Based on all available information, a causal relationship between pembrolizumab and sarcoidosis cannot be excluded. Therefore, sarcoidosis should be added to the list of adverse drug reactions with a frequency 'rare'.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pembrolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pembrolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
