## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 13 March 2018 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include 1st line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy based on the efficacy and safety data from pivotal study KEYNOTE-189, supported by data from KEYNOTE-021 cohorts C and G.

KEYNOTE-189 is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab +pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin (pembro combo) versus saline placebo + pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin (control) in previously untreated subjects with advanced/metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

An updated RMP version 16.2 was provided as part of the application.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0043/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expressed on the surface of cancer cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. It acts as immune check-point inhibitor by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that downregulates the effector function of T cells, with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity (Oncologist. 2017 Jan; 22(1): 81-88).

The pharmacological inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 is a consolidated approach in the treatment of different malignancies. In the setting of lung disease, pembrolizumab is recommended as first-line option in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highly-expressing PD-L1 (≥50% tumour portion score, TPS) and negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements. In the second-line setting, pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen (patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda). (ESMO Guidelines 2018).For both

these clinical indications, pembrolizumab is used as a monotherapy. Regulatory approval was granted on 29 July 2016 for the treatment of previously treated PD-L1 TPS ≥1% locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients on the basis of the KEYNOTE-010 clinical trial, and on 27 January 2017 for the first-line treatment of metastatic PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC as supported by the KEYNOTE-024 study. With the current type II variation application, the MAH is pursuing an extension of indication of pembrolizumab to be used in combination with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

Lung cancer is the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.69 million of deaths globally per year as estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Around 85%-90% of all lung cancers are Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), that include non-squamous (i.e, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous (epidermoid) cell carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011). During the last 25 years, the distribution of NSCLC histological types changed in Europe, with a decrease of squamous cell carcinoma and an increase of adenocarcinoma in men, while in women there was an increase of both histologies. Non-squamous NSCLC is the prevailing histological type diagnosed in never smoker NSCLC patients, with a higher prevalence in females than males. More than half of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease, which directly contributes to poor survival, as expressed by an untreated median OS of 4 months and a metastatic 5-year survival rate of &lt;5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016).

Platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy has long been considered among the equally effective platinum doublet regimens (cisplatin and carboplatin combinations with gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel) that current guidelines recommend as 1L approach, in the absence of driver mutations (i.e, EGFR and ALK negative disease), for the treatment of patients who present without major comorbidities and ECOG PS 0-2 (Novello S. et al, 2016). The efficacy of pemetrexed maintenance treatment, either as long-term use of an agent included in the first-line treatment ('continuation maintenance') or as introduction of a new agent after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy ('switch maintenance') has demonstrated significant improvement in the efficacy outcome of the non-squamous NSCLC histology. With the advent of pembrolizumab and its approval (2016) in the 1L setting as monotherapy in NSCLC with TPS ≥50% based on the positive results of the phase III, randomized, KEYNOTE-024 study (i.e PFS HR: 0.50, p&lt;0.001; OS HR: 0.60, p=0.005 pembrolizumab vs a SOC platinum-based doublet), this is now indicated as first-choice also in non-squamous NSCLC patients highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%). (ESMO eUpdate 28 June 2017). However, there remains substantial unmet medical need for patients with previously untreated nonsquamous NSCLC, since a fraction of subjects with highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) does not derive benefit from pembrolizumab as monotherapy, and also considering that only 25% to 30% of patients with NSCLC have tumors with a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%.

Emerging evidence suggest that combining immunotherapy with anticancer agents could provide better clinical outcomes by enhancing the anti-tumour immune response stimulated by chemotherapy (Apetoh L et al, 2015).

The MAH applied for the following change of indication:

'KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations.'

The same indication was the subject of a previously submitted Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) that the MAH subsequently withdrew.

For the purpose of the current submission, an updated analysis of the KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G is provided as supportive study. Results from the first Interim Analysis (IA1) of the Pivotal/Main study KEYNOTE-189 ( A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects (KEYNOTE-189 ) are also presented.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.1. Pharmacokinetics

Clinical pharmacology results specific to 1st line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy indication are available from study KEYNOTE-021 (cohort G1) and are further informed by results obtained in other indications previously approved with pembrolizumab.

The updated clinical pharmacology results in this submission include:

- Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from KEYNOTE-021 (cohort G1)
- A focused analysis to assess the consistency of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in patients with NSCLC from study KN021 (Cohort C and G1) who received concomitant pemetrexed and platinum therapy with the established definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetic in target population

Previously, a pooled population PK analysis using data from the KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was performed to characterize serum pembrolizumab concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications (Report 04DDV3). In support of this specific submission, a focused PK analysis was conducted primarily to show the similarity of observed concentrations in subjects with NSCLC from study KN021 (Cohort C and G1) who received concomitant pemetrexed and platinum therapy with the predictions from the definitive population PK analysis, and is presented in the PK report (Report 04JYRX). See below section on PK/PD Modelling.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Pembrolizumab is an antibody which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Pembrolizumab potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment.

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

No new primary or secondary pharmacology studies have been submitted.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

Previously, a pooled population PK analysis (report 04DDV3) using KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies was performed to characterize serum concentrations over time based on a dataset including 2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications. This analysis is considered the definitive population PK analysis to characterize pembrolizumab PK and inform the label for pembrolizumab.

The structure of the definitive population PK model for pembrolizumab has a two-compartment model structure with a linear clearance from the central compartment, parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), central compartment volume of distribution (Vc), and peripheral compartment volume of distribution (Vp). All PK parameters were allometrically scaled based on body weight with separate exponents estimated for the clearance (CL, Q) and volume (Vc, Vp) parameters, as follows:

where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be estimated. WT is the individual body weight, and Median WT is the median body weight across the analysis population.

In addition to body weight, the existing population PK model contained several more covariate relationships, which were established through a stepwise covariate search. The covariate relationships used the following generic form for continuous covariates, similar to the relationships for body weight.

The following function was used to describe the effects of categorical covariates:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Where θx is a typical value of a pharmacokinetic parameter P*, and θy is the fixed-effect parameter to be estimated, and Cov is the (continuous) covariate value and Q is the indicator variable denoting the category of the (categorical) covariate.

Specifically, the following covariates were included in the model:

| Covariate             | Type of covariate   | Parameter   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Gender                | Categorical         | CL and Vc   |
| Bilirubin             | Continuous          | CL          |
| eGFR                  | Continuous          | CL          |
| Albumin               | Continuous          | CL and Vc   |
| Tumor burden          | Continuous          | CL          |
| ECOGperformancestatus | Categorical         | CL          |
| Cancer type           | Categorical         | CL          |
| PriorIPItreatment     | Categorical         | CL and Vc   |

In this model, the impact of these covariates on pembrolizumab exposure was limited (generally less than 20%) and therefore was not considered to be of clinical relevance.

Inter-individual variability (IIV) of the PK parameters (CL, Volume of distributions (Vc and Vp) and inter-compartmental clearance Q) was included using a lognormal random effects model.

Residual variability (RV), a composite measure of assay error, dose/sample time collection errors, model misspecification, and any other unexplained variability within a subject, was modeled using a log-transformed additive error model (for the assessment of the population PK analysis, please refer to the EPAR for variation II/11 of Keytruda).

No additional model development was performed in the current analysis, and the definitive population PK was used as is. For this updated PK evaluation, the data from NSCLC concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and platinum therapy from Cohorts C and G of study KN021 were added to the dataset. The final analysis data set from studies KN001, KN002, KN006 and KN021 used for the population PK based comparisons comprised of a total of 12588 pembrolizumab concentrations from 2259 patients. Of these, 335 observations from KN021 cohort C and G1 are in NSCLC receiving concomitant treatment.

The number of subjects and PK observations by dose in the pooled analysis dataset are provided in the following table:

## 2.3.4. Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology

The starting point for the population PK analysis submitted in the current variation application was the previous population PK analysis based on dataset including 2188 subjects across the melanoma and NSCLC indications (KN001, KN002 and KN006 studies). This former analysis is considered the definitive population PK model to inform the label for pembrolizumab and no further model development was performed in the current analysis which incorporates data from NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy recruited in study KN021. Thus, the final dataset consist of a total of 12588 determinations of pembrolizumab concentrations from 2259 patients.

The approach taken by the applicant was to utilize the definitive population PK model to predict pembrolizumab levels in NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy after 200 mg Q3W administration. The predictions were compared with observed levels determined in study KN021.

In general, the observed concentrations in this setting (1L NSCLC in combination with pemetrexed and platinum therapy) fall within the range of predicted concentrations, at least during the first cycle, indicating that the definitive population PK model developed on monotherapy data provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is noted that observed median Cmin (Cycle 1) of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3w in NSCLC patients concomitantly treated with pemetrexed and platinum therapy is slightly higher than expected from NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy at the same dose regimen (14.15 vs. 12.7 µg/mL).

According to the study protocols, PK sampling of study KN021 included several pre- dose trough samples beyond cycle 1. In particular, as reported in the final protocol of the study, 'trough (pre-dose) and peak (post-dose) samples will be collected at Cycles 1 and 2. A trough sample will be collected at Cycle 3, 6, 9, 13 and 17. All trough samples should be drawn within 24 hours before infusion of pembrolizumab and the peak samples in cycle 1 and 2 should be drawn within 30 minutes after the end of the infusion'.

Regarding immunogenicity, no new data are available for this submission since no more data were collected with respect to the previous dataset.

The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab is based on a sufficiently large dataset of 3268 patients, with a very low observed rate of treatment emergent ADA (1.8%) and no demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety. This percentage was consistent across tumour type.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

This submission is based on the first interim analysis (IA1; date cut-off: 08 Nov 2017) of the Phase 3 trial KEYNOTE-189, supported by data from an updated analysis of the Phase 1/2 trial KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G (KEYNOTE-021-G). Both studies evaluated pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy (pembro combo) compared with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy (control) in the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Detailed information for both studies are summarised in the following table:

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

The recommended dose of 200 mg Q3W of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin, which is also the approved dose of pembrolizumab in monotherapy for previously-untreated PD-L1 strongly positive NSCLC patients, was derived from the KEYNOTE-021 study. The use of the approved 200 mg Q3W monotherapy dose in combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin is supported by consistency in pembrolizumab PK between combination and monotherapy administration. This has been reviewed in the context of a previous application (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) which was withdrawn during the procedure.

## 2.4.2. Main study

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects (KEYNOTE-189)

KEYNOTE-189 is a worldwide, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, double-blind study of pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus saline placebo combined with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who had not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease and in whom EGFR or ALK-directed therapy was not indicated.

## Objectives

## Primary Objectives

1. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria on Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) of imaging.
2. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using OS.

## Secondary Objectives

1. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.
2. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.
3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy.

## Exploratory Objectives

1. To evaluate the effect of PD-L1 expression levels on the efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS, and ORR.
2. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using PFS, ORR, and DOR assessed by the investigator using RECIST 1.1.
3. To evaluate changes in health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) assessments from baseline in the biomarker-positive strata and in the overall study population using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Core 30 items (C30) and EORTC QLQ-Lung Cancer 13 items (LC13).
4. To characterize utilities in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with saline placebo in combination with chemotherapy using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoints

- Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

## Secondary endpoints

- Overall response rate (ORR) assessed per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR
- Duration of response (DOR)

## Sample size

The analyses are event driven. A sample size of 570 subjects was planned to provide an adequate number of events in order to detect an HR of 0.7 at α=0.025 (one-sided) for both PFS and OS with a power of:

- at least 72% for the PFS and 37% for the OS endpoint at the IA1 tests,
- at least 90% for the PFS and 73% for the OS at the IA2 tests (final of PFS), and
- at least 90% at the final analysis for the OS,

assuming a median PFS of ~6.5 months and a median OS of 13 months in the control arm (assumed to follow an exponential distribution), with a randomization ratio of 2:1 between the experimental and control group.

Enrollment of 570 subjects is assumed to occur over 12 months.

One interim analysis of PFS and two interim analyses of OS are planned in addition to the respective final analyses.

| Analysis   | Endpoint(s)                                  | Timing                                                 |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| IA1        | PFS: OS: ORR if both PFS and OS are positive | ~370 PFS events (~242 OS events expected at this time) |
| IA2        | PFS: OS                                      | ~468 PFS events (~332 OS events expected at this time) |
| FA         | OS                                           | ~416 OS events                                         |

## Randomisation

Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Subjects were assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or saline placebo and chemotherapy, respectively. The choice of cisplatin or carboplatin treatment was determined prior to randomization and documented in the IVRS/IWRS.

Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to the following factors:

1. PD-L1 expression: Tumor Proportion Score ≥ 1% vs &lt;1%. PD-L1 unevaluable subjects were included in the TPS &lt;1% group.
2. Platinum chemotherapy: cisplatin vs carboplatin
3. Smoking status: never vs former/current

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double-blinded, but the clinical supplies were provided open-label. Therefore, an unblinded pharmacist provided the investigative staff with ready-to-use blinded pembrolizumab or saline infusion solutions, packaged identically in order to maintain the blinding, for administration at scheduled infusion visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment identification information was unmasked only if necessary for the welfare of the subject. Once an emergency unblinding occurred, the principal investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel were unblinded so that appropriate follow-up medical care could be provided to the subject.

## Statistical methods

## Analysis populations

The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for primary efficacy analysis. All randomized subjects will be included in this population. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. If an unexpectedly large number of randomized subjects are not treated, analyses may be performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS), including all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and did not have a major protocol violation.

## Primary Endpoint analyses:

The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS and survival curve in each treatment group. The following table summarizes the primary analysis approach for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints:

## Multiplicity

The trial uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to provide multiplicity control for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. The type I error reallocation strategy for endpoints PFS, OS, and ORR is shown in the following figure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The overall Type I error rate for each endpoint in the group sequential tests is strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided); for both PFS and OS, this is based on the Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. Between the endpoints, the type I error is controlled by the following rollover rule. The total type I error allocated to PFS (0.0095) is subject to rollover to OS if the PFS test is positive. The type I error allocated to OS (0.0155) is subject to rollover to PFS if the OS test is positive. Furthermore, the total type I error (0.025) is subject to rollover to ORR at IA1 if the PFS and OS tests are both positive.

## Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoints

Mainly, sensitivity analyses will be performed for PFS endpoint.

For the primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, regardless of discontinuation of study drug. Death is always considered as a confirmed PD event. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor, two sensitivity analyses with different sets of censoring rules were performed. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in the following table.

Table 5: Censory rules for primary and sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analyses will be performed also for comparison of PFS based on investigator's assessment.

In case of potential gross imbalance in baseline prognostic factors in the ITT population with TPS≥50% (due to lack of stratification according to TPS≥50% vs. TPS&lt;50%), sensitivity analyses for OS and PFS may be performed using the multivariate Cox regression to adjust for those imbalanced baseline prognostic factors.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol was implemented by a total of 8 amendments.

The main changes are summarised below:

| Protocol Amendment   | Most relevant changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 02 (10 Feb 2016)     | Corrected the reporting periods for all AE categories following cessation of study treatment, from 14 to 90 days for SAEs or 30 days in the event of initiation of new anti-cancer therapies; removed inclusion criterion requiring TSH within normal limits; updated the list of concomitant medications allowed and prohibited; updated required assessments for PK analysis, quality of life and safety follow-up                                         |
| 04 (16 Mar 2017)     | Revised the SAP and objectives according with FDA input to place more emphasis on OS; addition of exploratory objective n.1 to address the importance of PD-L1 expression on efficacy and objective n.8 to address the importance of outcomes post-Crossover                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07 (06 Nov 2017)     | Promoted OS to primary endpoint; timing of IA1 was changed to occur at approximately 370 PFS rather than 300 events PFS as previously defined, to provide a more robust analysis of the data, focusing on OS and adjust the alpha spending. In addition, subject accrual was greater than originally expected and estimated timing of interim analyses can now be calculated based on actual enrollment (N=616), rather than the planned enrollment (N=570). |

Response: Best overall response as confirmed complete response or partial response.

Include subjects who progressed or died either prior to or without missing 2 or more consecutive disease assessments.

Ongoing response: subjects who are alive, have not progressed, have not initiated new anti-cancer treatment,have not been determined to be lost to follow-up and whose last adequate assessment was &lt;5 monthspriortothedatacutoff date.

\"+\" indicates there is no progressive disease by the time of last disease assessment.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Pembrolizumab monotherapy is already part of the NSCLC treatment algorithm, having been approved as first-line treatment of metastatic PD-L1 strongly positive (TPS≥50%) NSCLC in the absence of EGFR or ALK gene rearrangements; and in second-line for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1 positive (TPS≥1%) patients who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, including the approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR and ALK positive tumours.

The current Type II variation application aims at extending the clinical indication of pembrolizumab as add-on treatment to platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy in non-squamous metastatic NSCLC patients irrespective of tumour PD-L1 level of expression based on the results of the pivotal phase III trial KEYNOTE-189.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy evidence in support of the current regulatory submission are derived from the first interim analysis (IA1 with cut-off date 08 Nov 2017) of the KEYNOTE-189, an ongoing Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Platinum + Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects. The data are supported by an updated analysis of cohort G of the Phase I/II study KEYNOTE-021, previously submitted as part of an application (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) subsequently withdrawn, consisting of the group of patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC cancer exposed to the intended dose of pembrolizumab (200

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg Q3W) in combination with carboplatin/pemetrexed. Patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were not eligible.

As being a randomised, double blind superiority trial versus chemotherapy alone, the study design of the pivotal KEYNOTE-189 allows for a controlled analysis of the add-on value of pembrolizumab to cytotoxic agents. Overall, patient selection criteria reflect the target population of the pursued clinical indication. The use of platinum/pemetrexed as a study comparator is deemed in line with current clinical practice as it represents a valuable therapeutic option among those recommended as 1L choice in the treatment of non-squamous NCSLC patients with tumours negative for EGFR and ALK mutations.  It is acknowledged that KEYNOTE-189 was designed before regulatory approval for pembrolizumab in 1L for NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS≥50%) was granted, and therefore the study design lacks a comparative arm including pembrolizumab monotherapy, that is currently the SoC for the treatment of this patient subgroup. The partial overlapping of the population targeted by the pursued extension of indication with the one for which a licensed indication is already in place, constitutes an element of concern. In the absence of a direct comparison between pembrolizumab as monotherapy and as add-on therapy to platinum-based doublets, a specification was proposed by the MAH to be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC to better reflect the need for treating physicians to consider a B/R ratio evaluation on individual basis, and provide a comprehensive description of currently available clinical trial results that are of clinical value in the process of treatment-decision making (i.e. efficacy outcomes by PD-L1 status and special considerations in the subgroup of patients aged ≥75 years)

The choice of OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR as primary endpoints enables a clinical benefit evaluation based on relevant efficacy outcomes in cancer therapy, and it is therefore deemed adequate. The key secondary endpoint was ORR per RECIST 1.1, with additional secondary endpoints to describe DOR and safety and tolerability.

Treatment allocation/randomization was stratified according to PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 1% vs &lt;1%; PD-L1 unevaluable included in the TPS &lt;1% group), Platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin vs carboplatin), smoking status (never vs former/current). This approach is deemed adequate. The sample size calculation of KEYNOTE-189 was appropriate for a comparative analysis between the two treatment arms (pembro combo vs control) in the ITT population (616 patients in total). The IA1 of KEYNOTE-189 that has been presented was event-driven and set-up at around 370 PFS events, as specified by Protocol Amendment n.7 (dated 06 Nov 2017), with an appropriate multiplicity adjustment between the two dual primary endpoints PFS and OS. It is noted that upgrading of OS as primary end-point was introduced with Amendment n.7, in response to FDA suggestions to pose major emphasis on the survival outcome, which is a reasonable approach. However, it should be noted that while PFS reached a maturity level of 88%, the level of maturity of OS analysis was 57% at this stage. Considering that the focus of this application is to extend the clinical indication of pembrolizumab as add-on treatment to chemotherapy irrespective of the PD-L1 level of expression, a robust characterisation of the efficacy profile of the experimental treatment in the different subgroups (TPS&lt;1%, TPS 1-49%, TPS≥50%) would be of value, particularly to contextualize the results taking into account the current treatment landscape. An updated analysis will be submitted post authorisation together with the final CSR by June 2021 (see RMP).

The supportive study KN021, in particular the randomized Cohort G1 of KEYNOTE-021 (ITT population=123 patients), is very similar in terms of eligibility criteria. Differently from study KN-189, cisplatin-based combinations were not allowed in this study, even though based on inclusion criteria, cisplatin-eligible patients could have been enrolled. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study KN021 was ORR per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, while PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR was considered a key secondary endpoint. These two endpoints were analyzed using a step down procedure, in which the Type I error rate (alpha=2.5%, one-sided) over the multiple endpoints was controlled by a fixed-sequence, closed-testing procedure that tested for a treatment difference for ORR first, followed by a test for a treatment difference for PFS. As additional secondary endpoints, OS and duration of response (DOR) were also evaluated. The primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy analysis of efficacy was planned to occur with at least 6 months of treatment or follow up for all patients enrolled, which is considered adequate. An updated analysis with 8 additional months of follow-up compared to the prior submission (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0027) has been submitted (cutoff date 31MAY-2017 vs 31-DEC-2016 in prior application).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The study population of both the pivotal study KEYNOTE-189 and supportive study KEYNOTE-021G, can be considered overall representative of the population targeted by the sought indication with regard to disease staging and histology. Baseline characteristics in KEYNOTE-189 appear well balanced between treatment arms, with the exception of age, gender and ECOG PS score. One could get a notion that the baseline characteristics of the pembro/combo group are slightly favourable (eg. ECOG=1 54% vs.61%). On the other hand, a higher percentage of subjects ≥65-year-old were recruited in the pembro combo compared to control (52% vs 44%). In addition, the higher percentage of female patients in the control arm could also favour the chemotherapy vs the pembro-combo arm (47% vs 38%).  At the time of inclusion, most patients in the pembrolizumab arm had ECOG 1 status (54%) or 0 (45.4%).

A clinically relevant benefit in OS is reported in KEYNOTE-189, with the Kaplan-Meier curves showing a more favourable outcome of pembro combo versus control, with a compelling HR=0.49 (95% CI: 0.38,0.64; p&lt;0.00001) in the overall study population. The median OS was not reached for the pembro combo but was 11.3 months (95% CI: 8.7, 15.1) for the control. The KM curves for OS demonstrated a separation beginning at Month 1 and these curves never cross, indicating the favourable OS for the pembro-chemo-combo therapy. This will be provided as a post-authorisation measure with the final CSR to be submitted by June 2021.

A benefit is also reported for PFS (with 66% of the total population with a PFS event occurred at the time of IA1) for pembro combo versus the control arm in the overall population, with a reduction in disease progression by 48% and a gain of about 4 months in median PFS (HR=0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; p&lt;0.00001). The data were confirmed by both the Sensitivity analysis 1 (HR=0.51 [0.42, 0.63]; p&lt;0.00001) and Investigator-based assessment (HR=0.53 [0.43, 0.64] P&lt;0.00001), demonstrating robustness of the finding.

The secondary end-point results are in further support of a beneficial effect of pembrolizumab co-administrated with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone (ORR 47.6% vs 18.9% with a median DoR of 11.2 vs 7.8 months in pembro combo vs control respectively).

Efficacy endpoints by subgroup analysis also demonstrate overall better performance of the combined treatment versus platinum/pemetrexed in all categories for both OS and PFS. However, stratification of results by factors such as age, sex and PD-L1 score demonstrates a variable degree of superiority of pembro combo vs control in OS and PFS, with PFS curves almost superimposable and HR=0.75 (95%CI 0.53-1.05) in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1&lt;1%. The dependency of treatment effect upon PD-L1 status recognises biological plausibility. Despite the 95% CI of PFS HR crossing 1 in the subgroup with PD-L1 score &lt;1%, the significant advantage in terms of OS of the experimental treatment versus chemotherapy only in this subpopulation, makes the results of clinical value.

A total of 57 NSCLC patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in study KEYNOTE-189 (35 in the pembrolizumab combination and 22 in the control). A trend towards reduced performance of pembrolizumab combination according to increasing age was noted with an apparent detrimental effect in subjects aged ≥75 years (HR=2.09 [0.84,5.23] in OS, and HR=1.73 [0.77,3.90] in PFS). Data are limited on the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with platinum chemotherapy in this patient population.

Unlike prior clinical studies (KEYNOTE-010; KEYNOTE-024) showing no apparent benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy in women, the KEYNOTE-189 points toward a higher efficacy of the combined therapy vs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

control in female than male subjects. Even in KN021 the ORR difference of male patients compared to female patients was 4%. The results from KN189 seem to be inconsistent. A gender imbalance has been noted between the two arms (38% vs 47.1% of the female population in pembro combo and control arm, respectively) that might constitute a bias in data interpretation, also in view of a historical difference in the clinical outcomes of immunotherapy in prior studies (Conforti F, et al. Lancet Oncol 2018) in favour of males. A sex adjusted analysis was requested and showed no bias due to gender in results analysis. There was underperformance of females in the control arm of KEYNOTE-189 (57.7% deaths compared to 47.7% deaths in males) as well as fewer deaths in females (23.1%) compared to males (35.8%) in the pembrolizumab combination arm. In addition, the therapeutic approach in KEYNOTE-189 is different from all of the studies evaluated by Conforti et al, as none included a treatment arm with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy. The observed difference between males and females will be monitored in the future submissions.

A benefit for the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is observed in the overall population. However, the results in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 score ≥50% should be considered in the context of the already authorised monotherapy indication for Keytruda. In this patient population, the combined therapy led to a substantial benefit with a HR=0.36 (0.25, 0.52; p&lt;0.00001) in PFS and HR=0.42 (0.26, 0.68; p=0.00012) in OS and 4.7 month gain over control in PFS. In the KEYNOTE-024, supporting the use of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in the first line NSCLC indication in patients with PD-L1 score ≥50%, a HR=0.63 (0.47, 0.86) vs SOC (p=0.002) was observed, with a gain of almost 15 months in OS over the control arm (HR=0.66 vs platinum/pemetrexed regimen). Hence, indirect comparison of data from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-189 indicates a minimal advantage of the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy combination over pembrolizumab monotherapy. Nevertheless, the outcome in the control arms of both studies differs, suggesting a slightly different (more favourable) patient population in KEYNOTE-189.  Thus the effect of chemotherapy could be regarded as borderline and therefore detrimental, because of the superior toxicity. Appropriate evaluations on the B/R ratio should be performed by treating physicians on an individual basis, particularly within the subgroups of patients with TPS≥50% and/or aged ≥75 years, taking into account all the experimental evidence emerged so far.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Efficacy results derived from the IA1 of the pivotal KEYNOTE-189 study provide evidence for a beneficial effect of pembrolizumab as add-on therapy to platinum/pemetrexed in non-squamous NSCLC patients. Data are limited in patients ≥ 75 years of age for whom pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.  No clinically meaningful differences in treatment effect between male and female patients emerged.  An updated analysis will be submitted post-authorisation together with the final CSR to better estimate the magnitude of the effect in the overall study population, as well as in the various subgroups taking into account the already authorised indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with TPS≥50%.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The evaluation of pembrolizumab's safety in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations is primarily based on results of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-189 trial. Supportive data from Cohorts C and G of the KEYNOTE-021 study are also provided.

Safety data are presented in tabular format including results from the following 5 datasets:

1. KEYNOTE-189 Combo Dataset (Pembro Combo): KEYNOTE-189 participants treated as first-line with pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/carboplatin or cisplatin; n=405;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. KEYNOTE-189 Combo + KEYNOTE-021-G/C Combo Safety Dataset (Pooled Combo SD): subjects participating  in  the  KEYNOTE-189  (n=405)  or  in  Cohorts  C  (n=24)  and  G  (n=59)  of  the KEYNOTE-021, all treated as first-line with pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/carboplatin or cisplatin; n=488;
3. KEYNOTE-189 Chemo + KEYNOTE-021-G Chemo Safety Dataset (Pooled Chemo SD): subjects participating in the KEYNOTE-189 (n=202) or in Cohort G of the KEYNOTE-021 (n=62) and treated with pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin; n=264;
4. Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  RSD): subjects  treated  with  pembrolizumab,  including  1567  subjects  with  advanced  melanoma  who participated in KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, and KEYNOTE-006, and 1232 subjects with NSCLC who participated in KEYNOTE-001 and KEYNOTE-010; n=2799;
5. Cumulative  Running  Safety  Dataset  for  Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  (Cumulative  Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy SD): Subjects treated with pembrolizumab from the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy  RSD  and  studies  previously  submitted  for  review  in  the  following  indications: KEYNOTE-012 Cohort B and B2 (head and neck cancer), Cohort C (bladder cancer), and Cohort D (gastric  cancer);  KEYNOTE-013  Cohort  3  and  KEYNOTE-087  (classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma); KEYNOTE-024 (NSCLC), KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial cancer); KEYNOTE-059 Cohort 1 (gastric cancer); KEYNOTE-164 Cohort A (colorectal cancer); and KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 4a and KEYNOTE-170 (primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma); n=4484.

Safety analyses were carried out on the All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population (randomized subjects receiving at least one study treatment dose at the time of cut-off dates). The 67 subjects who crossed over from chemotherapy (Control arm) to pembrolizumab monotherapy were censored at time of crossover and safety results of these patients are not provided.

No Tier 1 safety parameters were specified in the protocol. Differently from planned in the protocol, between-group comparisons were not performed for all non-prespecified Tier 2 events, occurring in &lt;4 subjects in any treatment group. In the changed safety analyses, between-group comparison was carried out and reported with risk differences and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) only for some selected events within AEs with &gt;10% incidence and Grade 3-5 AEs &gt;5% incidence. Tier 3 events, occurring in &lt;4 subjects in any treatment group, were evaluated only with point estimates by treatment group.

## Patient exposure

For KEYNOTE-189, data cut-off was 08 Nov 2017. At that time, out of 616 randomized, a total of 607 participants had received at least one study dose. Treatment was ongoing in 33.8% of 405 subjects treated of the Pembro Combo arm and in 17.8% of 202 patients of the Control arm. Sixty-seven subjects (33.2%) treated with chemotherapy, crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy because of disease progression and according to protocol-specified criteria.

## Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

The following approach was used to reflect ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8: events not already included in section 4.8 as associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy and for which clinically meaningful imbalances between treatment arms persisted despite adjustment for exposure and for which there was potential biologic plausibility for an association with exposure to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy were selected for inclusion. The appropriate frequency categories for these events were then determined according to MedDRA definitions. The events, febrile neutropenia and acute kidney injury met these criteria and are proposed for inclusion in section 4.8.

## Deaths

The proportion of deaths due to AEs was similar between the treatment groups (pembro combo: 27 subjects [6.7%]; control: 12 subjects [5.9%]). Pneumonitis (3 [0.7%]), in the pembro combo, was the most frequently reported AE resulting in death.

Cardiac events (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, and myocardial infarction) resulting in death were more frequently reported in the pembro combo compared with the control (1.2% versus 0.0%, respectively). Cardiac arrest occurred in the setting of Grade 3 dyspnea with Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; cardiac failure occurred in the setting of Grade 2 cerebrovascular accident; and cardiopulmonary failure occurred in the setting of Grade 4 asthenia. Two were acute events: cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction. Autopsies were available for 2 of these events confirming cardiorespiratory decompensation in the setting of NSCLC and myocardial infarction with cardiorespiratory arrest. These all

occurred early in the course of treatment in subjects with multiple comorbidities and were reported as terminal events; none appear associated with immune-related AEs.

## Adverse events of Special Interest (AEOSIs)

The following AEOSIs were reported: Pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.9% in chemo and 3.3% in pembro monotherapy), Hyperthyroidism (4.0% vs 3.3% in pembro monotherapy), Colitis (2.2% vs 1.9% in pembro monotherapy), Severe Skin Reaction (2.0% vs 1.3% in pembro monotherapy), and Hepatitis (1.2% vs 0.6% in pembro monotherapy). Nephritis was observed with increased frequency in the pembro combo than the reference database (1.7% vs 0.2% in pembro monotherapy).

## Laboratory findings

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 50%) laboratory abnormalities were similar in the Pooled Combo SD and the Pooled Chemo SD, and the majority were CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 toxicity:

- Pooled Combo SD: hemoglobin decreased (84.4%), glucose increased (65.7%), lymphocytes decreased (62.6%), leukocytes decreased (53.2%)
- Pooled Chemo SD: hemoglobin decreased (82.0%), lymphocytes decreased (63.9%), glucose increased (62.0%), leukocytes decreased (52.0%)

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 9%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar in the Pooled Combo SD and the Pooled Chemo SD:

- Pooled Combo SD: lymphocytes decreased (22.6%), neutrophils decreased (18.6%), hemoglobin decreased (16.9%), leukocytes decreased (11.7%), platelets decreased (10.9%), phosphate decreased (9.7%)
- Pooled Chemo SD: lymphocytes decreased (24.6%), hemoglobin decreased (19.1%), neutrophils decreased (16.7%), phosphate decreased (13.1%), leukocytes decreased (9.4%), and platelets  decreased (9.1%)

Though reported less commonly, the higher frequency of increased creatinine was consistent with the increased frequency of acute kidney injury and nephritis observed in the Pooled Combo SD and Pooled Chemo SD. Increased creatinine was reported more frequently in the Pooled Combo SD compared with the Pooled Chemo SD and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD, at 36.8%, 23.8%, and 16.0%, respectively. Likewise, the frequency of Grade 3 to 4 increased creatinine was 4.2%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal DDI studies have been conducted as part of this application.

As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, other enzymes, or transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed. In addition, in vitro experiments and studies conducted in preclinical species have been shown to have limited value in predicting DDI potential in humans. Therefore, no preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs.

Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Nevertheless, given the study design, exclusion criteria, and immunomodulatory mechanism of action, the use of systemic corticosteroids (at doses greater than physiologic replacement), or other immunosuppressants before the start of pembrolizumab treatment, is not recommended. However, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants, can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related adverse reactions.

## Post marketing experience

The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the period 04-Mar-2017 through 03-Sep-2017 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201709).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a result of the review of the PSUR, the SmPC section 4.8 was updated to add pericarditis and pericardial effusion as new adverse drug reactions (ADR) with a frequency uncommon and to add a footnote to the existing ADR  'myasthenic syndrome' to indicate that the event 'myasthenia gravis' is included.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The evaluation of pembrolizumab's safety in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations is primarily based on the results of the first interim analysis of the ongoing pivotal KEYNOTE-189 trial supported by data from Cohorts C and G of the KEYNOTE-021 study. The two study populations were grouped in a Pooled Combo (n=488) and  Pooled Chemo (n=264) dataset for a comparative analysis, which is acceptable in light of the consistency in clinical and disease characteristics between the two study populations, and only minor dissimilarities in patient demographics. Furthermore, the safety database include a reference dataset for the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD (NSCLC and melanoma, n=2799) and the Cumulative Running Pembrolizumab Monotherapy SD, regardless of indication (n=4484).

Overall, the submitted dataset is considered numerically appropriate for safety evaluation, also in consideration of the fact that long-term exposure data derived from the KEYNOTE-189 study were available in 51.7% and 14.5% of the study population for ≥6 months and ≥12 months, respectively.

The duration of exposure was considerably longer for the pembro combo compared with the control (and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD). This included a higher exposure to pemetrexed with more patients entering the maintenance phase and a higher exposure to carboplatin in the induction phase in the pembro combo arm compared with the control. It is acknowledged that these differences in exposure have to be taken into consideration when evaluating the safety profile of the different treatment options.

While overall adverse events (AEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs) compared similarly among treatment strategies, the frequency of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (47.3% vs 37.1%), SAEs (50% vs 43.6%), and drug-related SAEs (26.4% vs 18.6%), as well as the rate of subjects who discontinued any drug due to either AEs (26.4% vs 14.8%), drug-related AEs (20.5% vs 9.8%), or SAEs (17.6% vs 8.3%) were all increased in patients treated with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy only. In both treatment groups, evaluation over time of exposure-adjusted incidences (0-3, 3-6, 6-12, &gt;12 months) in Study KEYNOTE-189 shows that overall and SOC-specific AE frequencies were higher during the first two periods, with declining rates thereafter, likely due to the more toxic platinum-based induction phase than the pemetrexed maintenance period.

Exposure-adjusted event rate was slightly lower in the Pembro Combo compared to the Control arm (194.01 vs 211.23 person-years of follow-up). Exposure adjusted incidences of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs, drug-related SAEs, that were more frequently reported with combo compared to chemotherapy were not reported, and have been requested.

Most common AEs (incidence ≥ 40%) were nausea, anaemia and fatigue in both treatment arms. Diarrhoea and rash were reported with higher incidences in the pembro combo arm compared to control (95% CI of risk difference exceeding 0). But most of the point estimates of other common AEs also favoured the control group. The risks of dyspnoea and cough occurred more commonly in the control group which possibly suggests improved disease control in the pembro combo in line with the more favourable efficacy results.

Drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were mainly associated with the known toxicity profile of chemotherapeutic agents, as being dominated by Blood and lymphatic system disorders (25.8% vs 23.5% in Pooled Pembro vs Pooled Chemo) that are uncommon in pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, within this SOC category, an additive effect of pembrolizumab could be recognised on the incidence of febrile neutropenia and Neutropenia. As regards the other categories, pembrolizumab as add-on therapy has worsen the safety profile of chemotherapy in all the different SOCs, with a particularly marked effect on Diarrhoea,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thrombocytopenia, Lacrimation increased, Constipation, Rash, Alanine Aminotransferase increase, Blood creatinine increased; in addition, 6 cases of both cardiac disorders and hepatobiliary disorders were reported in the population exposed to combined therapy compared to none in the control arm.

Myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal disorders, pneumonitis and renal toxicity were among the most frequent drug-related SAEs for both the combined therapy group and control arm, although with higher frequency in the former than the latter.

Pneumonitis and acute kidney injury were also among the major reasons for drug-related AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation. On the contrarily, myelotoxicity represented the major cause of drug-related interruption for both pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.

Overall, type and frequency of specific AEOSIs was consistent with the established pembrolizumab safety profile with the exception of Pneumonitis, Hyperthyroidism, Colitis, Severe Skin Reaction, Nephritis, and Hepatitis. No new indication-specific, immune-mediated AE causally associated with pembrolizumab was found. These findings likely reflect overlapping toxicities associated with pembrolizumab monotherapy and pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone. Prior exposure to thoracic radiation was identified as risk factor associated with a higher incidence of pneumonitis.

In conclusion, it appears that the addition of pembrolizumab increases the risk of some expected toxicities with chemotherapy regimens. Based on the submitted data it is not possible to understand if such an increase is observed regardless of the platinum-based regimen used, or whether the added toxicity is more pronounced with one treatment or the other.

For the purpose of better understanding the relation between the toxicities observed with the combination compared to chemotherapy alone, the MAH has been requested to present safety data from both arms of KEYNOTE-189 by the type of chemotherapy regimen (i.e. cisplatin- or carboplatin-based), and summarize the pattern of AEs observed when pembrolizumab is combined with either cisplatin-based chemotherapy or carboplatin-based chemotherapy (data not shown). The combination of pembrolizumab to either cisplatin or carboplatin-based doublets showed a similar safety profile. No differences emerged in terms of AE pattern across the different SOC categories between the groups of patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination to either cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy.

Death rate in Study KEYNOTE-189 was slightly higher in the Pembro Combo arm when compared to Controls (27 subjects [6.7%] vs 12 subjects [5.9%], respectively). All narratives of these events were reviewed, drug-related deaths were reported in 9 subjects [2.2%] in the Pembro Combo versus 2 subjects [1%] in the Control. In the pembro combo arm 3 patients suffered deaths due to pneumonitis. 5 subjects died due to cardiac events (versus 0 in the control). Apart from two acute cardiac events concomitant AEs in the 3 further subjects were myelotoxicity (Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), cerebrovascular accident and Grade 4 asthenia (with pneumonia and PE in the autopsy). Neutropenia appeared to be a relevant underlying factor also for other deaths with and without infections (e.g. grade 5 neutropenic sepsis; grade 5 peritonitis with Grade 4 febrile neutropenia; Grade 5 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia with Grade 4 neutropenia; Grade 5 acute kidney injury with neutropenic sepsis in two cases; Grade 5 intestinal ischaemia with grade 4 decreased neutrophil count; Grade 5 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with grade 4 neutropenia and 4 decreased platelet count).

Fatal infections without (relevant) neutropenia were reported in three further patients (pneumonia in the context of malignant neoplasm progression, septic shock and lung infection).

Further notable is a higher proportion of fatal ischaemic vascular events (2 cases of ischaemic stroke/cerebral infarction) and 3 cases of intestinal ischaemia/mesenteric artery embolism compared to none in the control arm).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 27 fatal events in the KEYNOTE-189 Pembro Combo arm occurred predominantly in males and all cases were &gt;60 years. Specifically, within the group of patients aged ≥75 years (34 patients in the experimental arm and 21 in the control group), fatalities were considerably higher in pembrolizumab+chemotherapy (20.6%) compared to chemotherapy only (4.8%). In agreement with this, the comparison between Pooled Combo vs Pooled Chemo in subjects aged ≥65 years revealed reduced tolerability of the combined therapy in more elderly patients as demonstrated by an increased incidence of drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (50.6% vs 39.8%), drug-related SAE (31.3% vs 21.1%), discontinuation due to drug-related AEs (23.5% vs 12.2%) and discontinuation due to drug related SAEs (13.6% vs 4.9%) . Particulalry marked it is the difference in drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs within the subgroup aged ≥75 years (46.3% vs 33.3%) and discontinuations due to drug-related SAEs (24.4% vs 4.2%). Because of the relatively low number of subjects, and the potential for baseline comorbities as a confounding factor, the B/R profile for patients ≥75 years has not been established. In the absence of these data, pembrolizumab should be used with caution in this population after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). As regards other subgroup analysis, the safety profile of pembro combo versus control arm looks overall comparable between gender and, as expected, the proportion of subjects in the Pooled Combo SD with an ECOG status of 0 who experienced AEs was generally lower than that of subjects with an ECOG status of 1.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The pembrolizumab/chemotherapy regimen was overall more toxic than chemotherapy alone or pembrolizumab monotherapy, especially in older patients. An additive effect of the immune check-point inhibitor on toxicities due to cytotoxic agents was observed, as well as an increased incidence of AEOSI such as pneumonitis and renal disorders that occurred at uncommon frequency in pembrolizumab monotherapy. Some adverse events (or the combination of AEs) are of concern and highlight the need for special awareness for treating physicians (such as severe and serious febrile neutropenia associated with fatal events, acute kidney injury and nephritis. Toxicities observed with the combination compared to chemotherapy alone were similar between cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Due to the partial overlapping of the target population of the sought indication with non-squamous NSCLC patients expressing high levels of PD-L1 (TPS ≥ 50%) for whom pembrolizumab monotherapy is recommended as SOC, evaluation of the B/R ratio on an individual basis should be considered by treating physicians in treatment decision-making, as supported by the experimental evidence reported in the SmPC.

No changes to the risk minimisation measures have been introduced as a result of the new indication.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptablefor the following reasons:

- A CHMP request was received during variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0023/G (new indications in urothelial carcinoma approved on 24-Aug-2017) to perform new user testing considering that all sections of the package leaflet were affected since marketing authorization. The proposed revisions included in this variation for 1L NSCLC do not constitute significant changes that would require the need to conduct a new user consultation.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

The MAH proposes an extension of indication for KEYTRUDA as add-on therapy to platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in the first-line setting of non-squamous NSCLC negative for EGFR and ALK gene aberrations.

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Lung cancer is the main cause of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.69 million of deaths globally per year as estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Around 85%-90% of all lung cancers are Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), that include non-squamous (i.e, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous (epidermoid) cell carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011). During the last 25 years, the distribution of NSCLC histological types changed in Europe, with a decrease of squamous cell carcinoma and an increase of adenocarcinoma in men, while in women there was an increase of both histologies.

Non-squamous NSCLC is the prevailing histological type diagnosed in never smoker NSCLC patients, with a higher prevalence in females than males. More than half of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of disease, which directly contributes to poor survival, as expressed by an untreated median OS of 4 months and a metastatic 5-year survival rate of &lt;5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016).

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In the first-line setting in non-squamous NSCLC not harbouring driver mutations (i.e, EGFR, ALK and ROS1 negative disease), chemotherapy represents the recommended choice for patients presenting with a tumour PD-L1 score &lt;50%. Platinum-based doublets (four to a maximum of six cycles) are considered the standard of care in patients with PS 0-1, as well as selected PS 2 and adequate organ function, with no major differences in terms of efficacy across combinations. Among these, platinum/pemetrexed represents a valid alternative and consists of a first induction phase with the two cytotoxic agents, followed by a continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed only, in the absence of progression after the first cycles of combined chemotherapy (ESMO guidelines). Introduction into clinical practice of this therapeutic scheme was based upon the positive results of the Phase III PARAMOUNT trial, providing evidence for an OS advantage of cisplatin induction (4 cycles) followed by pemetrexed over cisplatin induction plus placebo (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 95%CI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195) that was consistent across patient subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, ECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age).

With the advent of pembrolizumab and its approval (2016) in the 1L setting as monotherapy in NSCLC with TPS ≥50% based on the positive results of the phase III, randomized, KEYNOTE-024 study (i.e PFS HR: 0.50, p&lt;0.001; OS HR: 0.60, p=0.005 pembrolizumab vs a SOC platinum-based doublet), this is now indicated as first-choice also in non-squamous NSCLC patients highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%). (ESMO eUpdate 28 June 2017). However, there remains substantial unmet medical need for patients with previously untreated nonsquamous NSCLC. Available systemic therapies, except that for tumors not harbouring EGFR sensitizing mutations or ALK rearrangements, can only determine a limited improvement in survival up to 8-12 months, with an enhanced symptom control and a better quality of life in 60%-70% despite treatment toxicity (Leighl NB. et al, 2012). In addition,  a fraction of subjects with highly expressing tumour PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) does not derive benefit from pembrolizumab as monotherapy, and only 25% to 30% of patients with NSCLC have tumours with a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%.

KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is already part of the treatment algorithm of NSCLC, with a licensed indication in the following therapeutic settings:

- -Second-line in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumour express PD-L1 with a ≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, and targeted therapy for patients with EGFR and ALK positive tumour mutations
- -First-line in metastatic NSCLC (including both squamous and non-squamous hystology) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥50% TPS and no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The current application is based upon results of the Phase III KEYNOTE-189 trial, a Randomized, Double-Blind, Study of Platinum+ Pemetrexed Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects. This is an ongoing study currently at its first interim analysis (IA1; date cut-off: 08 Nov 2017).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

- A more favourable outcome of pembrolizumab combination versus control in terms of OS was demonstrated in the overall study population (HR=0.49 [95% CI: 0.38,0.64]; p&lt;0.00001)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A gain of about 4.7 months in median PFS (HR=0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; p&lt;0.00001) was reported for the pembrolizumab combination vs control in the overall population.
- ORR was 47.6% vs 18.9% in the pembrolizumab combination vs control respectively, resulting in 28.5% difference in response rates in the overall population. Additionally the median DOR was 11.2 months for the pembrolizumab combination and 7.8 months for the control.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

- Immaturity in OS (57% of events at the planned IA1); however the MAH committed to provide updated data as post-authorisation measure with the CSR to be expected by June 2021
- Decreased survival (HR=2.09 [0.84, 5.23] in OS), reduction in PFS (HR=1.73 [0.77,3.90] and an increase in ORR (14.4% difference [-11.1,36.4]) induced by pembrolizumab combination in patients aged ≥ 75 years; the limited sample size of this subgroup does not allow definitive conclusions to be made and the limitations have been reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.
- Lack of comparison with a control arm consisting of pembrolizumab in monotherapy for NSCLC patients with TPS≥50% (reflecting currently licensed indication); in the absence of direct comparative analysis, the B/R should be considered on an individual basis by treating physicians on the basis of experimental data as detailed in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

- In KEYNOTE-189, frequency of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (48.4% vs 39.6%), and of subjects who discontinued any drug due to either AEs (27.7% vs 14.9%), or drug-related AEs (21.0% vs 8.4%), or SAEs (18.8% vs 9.4) or drug-related SAEs (13.3 vs 3.5) were all increased in patients treated with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy only.
- Patients treated with pembrolizumab+chemotherapy displayed a higher occurrence of drug-related Diarrhoea (20.1% vs 11.7%), Thrombocytopenia (14.8% vs 11.7%), Lacrimation increased (12.7% vs 8 %), %), Constipation (16.8% vs 11.4%), Rash (14.8% vs 9.8%), Alanine Aminotransferase increase (11.3% vs 9.1%), Blood creatinine increased (9.2% vs 6.1%), Febrile neutropenia (5.3% vs 1.5%) , Acute kidney injury (3.7% vs 0.4%), Pyrexia (6.1% vs 1.9%), Dysgeusia (10% vs 8%), Peripheral Oedema (7.8% vs 5.7%). Moreover, an increased rate of drug-related AEOSI for pembrolizumab were generally reported in the combined regimen than in pembrolizumab monotherapy, with particular reference to pneumonitis (4.1% vs 3.1% in the Pooled Combo and Cumulative Reference SD; 1.1% in the Pooled Chemo) and nephritis (1.4% vs 0.2% in the Pooled Combo and Cumulative Reference SD; 0% in the Pooled Chemo).
- The most common drug-related AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the Pooled Pembro Combo were Pneumonitis (2.5% vs 1.1% in Pooled Chemo) and Acute kidney injury (2% vs 0% in Pooled Chemo). The incidence of these drug-related AEs in the group treated with pembrolizumab in combination to chemotherapy was higher also in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy (1.2% and 0.1% for Pneumonitis and Acute kidney injury , respectively in the Reference dataset).

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

- Differences in safety between elderly and younger patients were observed in all treatment arms, but appear partially more pronounced in the Pooled Combo SD (e.g. for subjects with 75-84 years 73.2% grade 3-5 AEs, 17.1% death due to AEs, 31.7% discontinuations due to an AE, 24.4% discontinuations due to SAEs). Moreover, for subjects with 75-84 years a high rate of CV events (34.1%) and cerebrovascular events (12.2%) was observed in the Pooled Combo SD (compared to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8.3% and 0%, respectively in the Pooled Chemo SD). Thus, the tolerability of the combination therapy in subjects of ≥75 year could be questioned, but the sample size in this subgroup might be not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. This has been reflected in the SmPC.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Immune check-point inhibitors are expected to improve clinical outcomes in patients co-treated with chemotherapy, through a potentiating effect on the anti-tumour immunological activity induced by the cytotoxic agents. According with this, an add-on value of pembrolizumab to the platinum/pemetrexed treatment scheme has been generally demonstrated in the KEYNOYTE-189 trial, in term of both OS and PFS.

Pembrolizumab in co-administration to platinum/pemetrexed seems to potentiate the toxic effects of the cytotoxic agents, as demonstrated by an increased rate of drug-related myelosuppression, gastrointestinal effects, and renal disorders in patients exposed to the combined therapy compared to those receiving platinum/pemetrexed only. On the other hand, chemotherapy appears to increase the immunological toxicity of pembrolizumab, considering that a higher frequency of nephritis was observed in the experimental arm compared to control.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Results from KEYNOTE-189 study are considered sufficient to establish a positive B/R in the sought indication for the first line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in combination with pemetrexed and platinum. The efficacy and safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, particularly within the subgroups of patients with TPS≥50% and ≥75-year old has been adequately described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include 1st line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, based on the efficacy and safety data from pivotal study KEYNOTE-189, supported by data from KEYNOTE-021 cohorts C and G.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

KEYNOTE-189 is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab +pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin (pembro combo) versus saline placebo + pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin (control) in previously untreated subjects with advanced/metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

An updated RMP version 17.0 was agreed during the procedure.
