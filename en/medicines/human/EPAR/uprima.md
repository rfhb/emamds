## Overview

On 28 May 2001 the European Commission granted a Marketing Authorisation for the whole European Union to Abbott Laboratories Limited, for Uprima (apomorphine hydrochloride), indicated for the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Uprima was marketed in Ireland, UK, Spain, France, Sweden and Norway.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder did not apply to renew the Marketing Authorisation for commercial reasons and consequently on 28 May 2006 the 5-year Marketing Authorisation for Uprima expired.

Following the expiring of the Community Marketing Authorisation the European Public Assessment Report for Uprima has been removed from this website.
