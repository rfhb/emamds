## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Inbrija 33 mg inhalation powder, hard capsules

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each hard capsule contains 42 mg levodopa. Each delivered dose contains 33 mg levodopa.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Inhalation powder, hard capsule.

White opaque capsules containing white powder, with 'A42' printed in black on the cap of the capsule and two black bands printed on the body of the capsule.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Inbrija is indicated for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Patients should be on a stable levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide) regimen before starting Inbrija.

Patients selected for treatment with Inbrija should be able to recognize the onset of their 'OFF' symptoms and be capable of preparing the inhaler or else have a responsible care giver able to prepare the inhaler for them when required.

Inbrija should be inhaled when symptoms, motor or non-motor, of an OFF period start to return.

The recommended dose of Inbrija is 2 hard capsules up to 5 times per day each delivering 33 mg levodopa. The maximum daily dose of Inbrija should not exceed 10 capsules (330 mg). It is not recommended to take more than 2 capsules per OFF period. Exceeding the recommended dose may lead to increased levodopa associated adverse reactions.

Abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of any levodopa medicinal product should be carefully observed, particularly in patients who are also receiving neuroleptics. See section 4.4 regarding withdrawal emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion.

## Elderly

No dose adjustment of Inbrija is required for elderly patients (≥65 years). There is only limited data available in very elderly patients (≥75 years).

## Renal impairment

Inbrija has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Inbrija has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Inbrija in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For inhalation use only. Inbrija hard capsules must not be swallowed.

The Inbrija inhaler is to be thrown away after all the capsules have been used.

The capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use.

The physician or other healthcare professional should instruct the patient how to administer the product correctly. A summary of how to use Inbrija is provided below.

- -A complete dose is 2 capsules taken one right after the other.
- -The patient should load 1 capsule into the Inbrija inhaler, breathe in and hold their breath for 5 seconds. The patient should hear the capsule 'whirl'.
- -The used capsule should be removed from the Inbrija inhaler and the second capsule loaded into the inhaler. The maximum time between inhalation of the powder from the first and second capsules should not exceed 10 minutes.
- -It is important to advise the patient that if they do not hear or feel the capsule 'whirl' while inhaling they may need to take a deeper, longer breath, breathing in again using the same capsule or they may need to clean the mouthpiece.

Detailed instructions for use for the patients are included in the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -Narrow-angle glaucoma.
- -Phaeochromocytoma.
- -Co-administration with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These inhibitors should already be discontinued for at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy due to the established underlying levodopa therapy (see section 4.5).
- -A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Bronchospasm in patients with lung disease

Because of the risk of bronchospasm, use of levodopa inhalation powder in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease is not recommended. There is limited data regarding chronic effect of Inbrija in respiratory compromised patients.

## Central Nervous System (CNS) effects and mental disturbances

## Somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset

Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset (see section 4.7). Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

driving or operating machines during treatment (see section 4.7). Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore, a reduction of dose or termination of therapy may be considered.

## Withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion

A symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterised by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious aetiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in the background dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, any abrupt dose reduction or withdrawal of any levodopa medicinal product should be carefully observed, particularly in patients who are also receiving neuroleptics.

## Mental disturbances

Patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioural changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like and suicidal behaviour during levodopa treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of levodopa. This abnormal thinking and behaviour can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder or a history of psychotic disorder must be treated cautiously with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medicinal products used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of levodopa. Concomitant use of antipsychotics should be monitored carefully for worsening of Parkinson's motor symptoms especially when D2-receptor antagonists are used (see section 4.5).

## Impulse control disorders

Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with levodopa. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop.

## Dyskinesia

Inbrija may cause dyskinesia. Adjustment of levodopa therapy or other medicinal products used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease may be considered.

## Cardiovascular ischaemic events

Inbrija should be administered with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Care should be exercised when Inbrija is administered to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac function should be monitored with particular care in such patients during the initiation of treatment with Inbrija.

## Peptic ulcer disease

Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (because of the possibility of upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage).

## Glaucoma

Levodopa may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Patients with chronic glaucoma may be treated cautiously with levodopa provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Melanoma

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as medicinal products used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

Periodic skin examinations are recommended to monitor for melanoma in patients receiving Inbrija.

## Laboratory monitoring

Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and positive Coombs test have also been reported.

## Interference with test

Levodopa may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. Falsenegative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on levodopa or levodopa/dopadecarboxylase inhibitor therapy.

## Orthostatic hypotension

Levodopa can cause orthostatic hypotension. Inbrija should be used with caution in case of concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause orthostatic hypotension, e.g. anti-hypertensive medicinal products.

## Intercurrent respiratory infection

There is limited data available on the use of Inbrija during a respiratory infection. Based on individual assessments of the severity of the intercurrent respiratory infection Inbrija may be continued or discontinued until the respiratory symptoms resolve (see section 4.2).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Non-selective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors

The use of non-selective MAO inhibitors with levodopa is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Any nonselective MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least 14 days prior to initiating levodopa.

## Selective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors

The use of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g. rasagiline, selegiline, and safinamide) with levodopa may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. Patients who are taking these medicinal products should be monitored closely.

## Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and isoniazid

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Patients who are taking these medicinal products should be monitored for worsening Parkinson's symptoms (see section 4.4).

## Antihypertensives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when combinations of levodopa and a dopadecarboxylase inhibitor are added to the treatment of patients already receiving certain antihypertensives. Dose adjustment of the antihypertensive medicinal products may be required during concomitant use of Inbrija.

## Anticholinergics

Anticholinergic medicinal products can work synergistically with levodopa, in order to improve tremor. Concurrent use can, however, cause a worsening of involuntary motor disorders. Anticholinergic medicinal products may impair the effect of oral levodopa medicinal products, due to a delayed absorption. A dose adjustment of levodopa may be required.

## COMT inhibitors

The addition of entacapone to a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor has been demonstrated to increase the levodopa bioavailability by 30%. A dose adjustment of levodopa may be required with concomitant use of COMT inhibitors.

## Tricyclic antidepressants

There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.

## Amantadine

Concurrent administration of levodopa and amantadine may increase confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, gastro-intestinal disturbances, or other atropine-like side effects. Psychotic reactions have been observed in patients receiving amantadine and levodopa.

## Local or systemic pulmonary medicinal products

Interactions of Inbrija with local or systemic pulmonary medicinal products were not investigated because Inbrija is not recommended in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic underlying lung disease (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of levodopa in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Inbrija is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

Levodopa is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of levodopa in newborns/infants. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Inbrija.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of levodopa on human fertility. Animal studies indicated no effect on fertility (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Levodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Certain side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness, that have been reported with other forms of levodopa medicinal products, may affect some patients' ability to drive or use machines.

Patients being treated with levodopa medicinal products and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. use machines), until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section 4.4).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most frequent adverse reactions reported in the Inbrija clinical studies were cough (15.6%), fall ( 8.7% ), upper respiratory tract infection (5.8%), dyskinesia ( 5.7% ) and sputum discoloured (2.8%). Serious adverse reactions of allergic oedema have been reported with levodopa medicinal products but not in clinical studies with Inbrija. A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis may occur with levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor medicinal products, although no cases have been identified in clinical studies with Inbrija. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been reported with levodopa medicinal products and was observed once in Inbrija clinical studies.

a Cardiac rhythm disorder here is a combined term representing atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, sick sinus syndrome, bradycardia, and tachycardia.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Sudden sleep onset

Levodopa is associated with somnolence and has been associated very rarely with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.

## Impulse control disorders

Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa (see section 4.4).

## Coughing

Most cough reported in the clinical studies with Inbrija were mild to moderate in intensity, and usually reported within the first 30 days of the treatment. Due to cough, 2% of subjects withdrew from the clinical studies with Inbrija.

## Sensation of choking

In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of the sensation of choking associated with the drug powder impacting the back of the throat, immediately following administration.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The acute symptoms of levodopa overdose can be expected to arise from dopaminergic overstimulation. Using more than one dose of Inbrija (2 capsules) to treat the same OFF period may result in CNS disturbances, with an increasing likelihood of cardiovascular disturbance (e.g. hypotension, tachycardia) and more severe psychiatric problems at higher doses.

Patients should be monitored and supportive care should be provided. Patients should receive electrocardiographic monitoring for the development of arrhythmias; if needed, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BA01

## Mechanism of action

Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, and is given as dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The effectiveness of Inbrija for the treatment of OFF episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease given on top of background dopaminergic treatment was evaluated in a 12-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Subjects had to be able to recognise OFF periods and to handle the device.

A total of 114 patients were randomised and treated with Inbrija 66 mg (two 33 mg capsules) and 112 patients received placebo. When experiencing an OFF period, subjects could use inhaled levodopa on demand up to five times a day. Apomorphine was not allowed as background medicinal product. At baseline, patients had at least 2 hours of OFF time per day, and the levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor medicines did not exceed 1,600 mg levodopa per day.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score 30 minutes post dose at week 12. The UPDRS part III is designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings (e.g. tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) in patients with Parkinson's disease. This endpoint was assessed in a clinical setting, i.e. patients had to take their regular morning oral levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor dose and then visit the clinic 2-5 hours post dose. If an OFF period emerged subjects received placebo or inhaled levodopa. UPDRS-III was assessed before and 30 minutes post dose administration. Reduction in mean daily OFF time and improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale, a patient reported outcome of the overall improvement and satisfaction with Inbrija treatment, and Responders ON were the main secondary endpoints. Results are presented in Table 2.

a Observed cases.

b A responder was defined as a subject that changed from OFF to ON within 60 minutes post dose and who remained ON at 60 minutes post dose.

c p-value for PGI-C is nominal.

## Pulmonary safety

In a subpopulation of the 12-week study, serial spirometry measurements were performed at 15, 30 and 60 minutes following the first dose of Inbrija 66 mg or placebo. No notable differences between placebo and Inbrija were observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following the first dose.

The effect of Inbrija on pulmonary function was also evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with an oral levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor in a 12-month, randomised, controlled, openlabeled study. A total of 271 patients were treated with Inbrija 66 mg (two 33 mg capsules), and 127 patients in an observational control group were observed on their regular oral medication regimen for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) every 3 months in both groups. After 12 months, the average reduction in FEV1 from baseline was the same in both groups (-0.1 L). The change from baseline for DLCO was compared between the Inbrija treatment group and the observational cohort; at the end of 12 months, there was no significant difference in the change from baseline between Inbrija group and the observational cohort in DLCO.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Inbrija in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The pharmacokinetics of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) and carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg immediate release tablets was evaluated in 24 healthy volunteers in a fasted state receiving a total of 50 mg carbidopa every 8 hours.

The median time to maximal plasma concentration of levodopa was 30 minutes after a dose of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) compared to 45 minutes after a dose of carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg immediate release tablets. The dose-normalised relative bioavailability of a single 66 mg emitted dose of Inbrija was 88.0% (90% CI: 80.3, 96.4) when compared to a single oral carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg dose.

The mean maximal plasma concentration at 10 minutes (C10min) and at peak concentration (Cmax) of levodopa following administration of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) was 418 ng/mL and 696 ng/mL, respectively, with exposure over 4 hours (AUC0-4 h) of 1,280 ng ● h/mL.

## Distribution

Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 168 L for Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules).

## Biotransformation

Levodopa is extensively metabolised to various metabolites. The two major metabolic pathways are decarboxylation by L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and O-methylation by catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT).

The pharmacokinetics of the major levodopa metabolites 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were studied following administration of a single inhaled dose of Inbrija and a single oral carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg immediate release tablet. The metabolite profile following Inbrija inhalation was not substantially different than that observed following oral carbidopa/levodopa administration. The peak metabolite concentrations and total exposure achieved after Inbrija administration did not exceed those observed following an oral carbidopa/levodopa dose.

The impact of the amount of circulating dopa-decarboxylase at the end of an oral carbidopa/levodopa dosing interval on the efficacy of Inbrija was not studied.

## Elimination

In the presence of carbidopa, the apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa following a single administration of Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) was 2.3 hours and comparable to that following an oral dose of carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg immediate release tablets of 1.9 hours.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Inbrija shows dose proportional pharmacokinetics of levodopa from 13 mg to 122 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Inbrija has not specifically been studied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Inbrija has not specifically been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).

## Gender

A clinical study was performed with Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) in 24 healthy subjects (13 men and 11 women). After administration of Inbrija the Cmax and AUC0-24 h for women were 42.2% higher and 48.8% higher than for men, respectively. After correcting the parameters for body weight, the gender difference after each treatment was no longer significant: the body-weight adjusted Cmax and AUC0-24 h after a dose of Inbrija in women were 9.7% and 15.1% higher than men. Most of the gender difference is accounted for by differences in body weight. No dose adjustment is required based on gender.

## Smoking

A clinical study was performed with Inbrija 66 mg (2 x 33 mg capsules) administered to 56 healthy subjects (31 non-smokers and 25 smokers). After administration of Inbrija the Cmax and AUC0-24 h was 11% to 12% higher for smokers than for non-smokers. No dose adjustment is required based on smoking status.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.

## Reproductive toxicity

Levodopa has caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. No effects were seen on male or female reproductive organs in repeat dose toxicology studies in mice, rats or monkeys with levodopa alone.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

## 1. What Inbrija is and what it is used for

The active substance in Inbrija is levodopa. Inbrija is a medicine used by inhalation for treating the worsening of your symptoms during the 'off periods' of Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease affects your movement and it is treated with a medicine that you take regularly. During off periods your usual medicine does not control the condition well enough and movement is likely to be more difficult.

You should continue taking your main medicine for Parkinson's disease and use Inbrija to control worsening of symptoms (such as inability to move) during off periods.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Inbrija

## Do not use Inbrija:

- -if you are allergic to levodopa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- -if you get blurred vision, red eyes, severe eye and head pain, halos around lights, pupils of your eyes that are larger than normal size and feel sick. If you have any of these symptoms, you may have a eye condition called narrow angle glaucoma, which occurs suddenly: do not take Inbrija and get urgent medical attention .
- -if you have a rare tumour of the adrenal gland called phaeochromocytoma.
- -if you are taking certain antidepressant medicines called non-selective MAO inhibitors (e.g. isocarboxazid and phenelzine). You must stop taking these medicines at least 14 days before starting treatment with Inbrija. See also under 'Other medicines and Inbrija'.
- -if you have previously suffered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a life-threatening reaction to certain medicines used to treat severe mental disorders or if you have suffered from non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis , a rare muscle disorder in which damaged muscle breaks down rapidly.

## Warnings and precautions

Get urgent medical help if you have tremors, agitation, confusion, fever, rapid pulse, or dizziness

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and fainting upon standing up, or you notice that your muscles get very rigid or jerk violently. These may be symptoms of 'withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia'. For more information see section 4.

## Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inbrija if you have, or have ever had, or you develop:

- -asthma, breathing difficulties like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other longterm lung diseases or breathing problems;
- -any form of severe mental disorder like psychosis;
- -a heart attack, or heart beat problems. Your doctor will monitor you closely during start of treatment;
- -an ulcer in your stomach or intestines;
- -an eye condition called glaucoma, because the pressure in your eyes may need to be monitored;
- -severe problems with your kidneys;
- -severe problems with your liver.

If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inbrija.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you develop any of the symptoms below whilst using Inbrija:

- -sudden sleep attacks or sometimes feeling very sleepy;
- -changes in or worsening of your mental state , which may be severe such as psychotic and suicidal behaviour;
- -hallucinations, along with being confused, unable to sleep and excessive dreaming. Abnormal thinking including anxiety, depression, being agitated, being paranoid, delusional, or disorientated, aggressive behaviour and delirious;
- -worsening of any breathing symptoms or having a respiratory infection ;
- -urges or cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings.

## Your doctor may need to review your treatments.

- -new or increased abnormal body movements (dyskinesia);
- -feeling dizzy when getting up (low blood pressure);
- -melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or suspicious skin growths or marks.

If you need to have surgery, tell your doctor that you are using Inbrija.

## Tests

You may need to have tests on your heart, liver, kidney, and blood cell tests during long-term treatment with your medicines. If you need to have tests on your blood or urine, tell your doctor or nurse that you are taking Inbrija. This is because the medicine may affect the results of some tests.

## Children and adolescents

The use of Inbrija is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age.

## Other medicines and Inbrija

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is because other medicines can affect the way Inbrija works.

Do not use Inbrija if you have taken medicines called non-selective MAO inhibitors for treating depression in the last 14 days. These medicines include isocarboxazid and phenelzine. If this applies to you, do not take Inbrija and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

## Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:

- -medicines for your Parkinson's disease called selective MAO inhibitors such as rasagiline, selegiline and safinamide, COMT inhibitors such as entacapone, tolcapone and opicapone, or anticholinergics such as orphenadrine and trihexyphenidyl;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for use:

## Read these instructions before you start using Inbrija.

## Overview

- Make sure your hands are clean and dry when using the inhaler and capsules.
- Only remove the capsules from the blister immediately before use.
- A complete dose is 2 capsules used one after the other.
- Load 1 capsule into the Inbrija inhaler, close your lips firmly around the mouthpiece, then breathe in (inhale) and hold that breath for 5 seconds. You should hear the capsule 'whirl'. Then, remove the used capsule and load a second capsule into the inhaler. Close your lips firmly around the mouthpiece and breathe in, again holding your breath for 5 seconds.
- You should inhale the contents of the second capsule within 10 minutes of the first one.
- Do not load 2 capsules at the same time.
- Dispose of all used capsules immediately after use.
- Dispose of the inhaler after you are finished all of the capsules in the carton.

## Prepare your dose

Step 1: Gather supplies

Inbrija33mg

<!-- image -->

Step 2: Remove blue cap from inhaler

<!-- image -->

Step 3: Twist and pull off white mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

Step 4: Remove 1 capsule from package

<!-- image -->

Step 5: Load capsule

<!-- image -->

Find a clean and dry surface.

Make sure your hands are clean and dry.

Get inhaler and strip of capsules.

Tear off package of 2 capsules.

## A full dose is 2 capsules.

Pull the cap straight off.

Place the cap to the side. You will need it later to store the inhaler.

Twist and pull off the mouthpiece to separate it from the handle.

Place the mouthpiece and inhaler on a clean and dry surface.

Carefully peel back the foil and take out 1 capsule.

Only remove 1 capsule at a time, and just before use.

Do not use any capsule that looks crushed, damaged or wet. Dispose of it and get a new capsule.

Hold the inhaler upright using the handle.

Drop 1 capsule into the opening of the capsule chamber.

Do not load 2 capsules at the same time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 6: Attach white mouthpiece

## Align arrows on mouthpiece and handle

<!-- image -->

## Compress mouthpiece only once

<!-- image -->

## Release mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

Your inhaler is now ready to use.

Do not push the handle and mouthpiece together more than once. This may damage the capsule, and you may not get your full dose. If this happens start again at Step 4 using a new capsule.

Make sure the mouthpiece is securely attached and will not fall off before moving to Step 7.

## Take your dose

## Step 7: Hold inhaler away and breathe out

<!-- image -->

Line up the white arrows on the handle and mouthpiece.

Firmly push the mouthpiece and handle together until you hear a click. This punctures the capsule.

Do not push the handle and mouthpiece together more than once.

Release the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece will spring back and stay attached.

Stand or sit with your head and chest upright.

Hold the inhaler level and away from your mouth. Breathe out completely.

Do not breathe into mouthpiece.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Step 8: Breathe in deeply to inhale powder

<!-- image -->

Step 9: Hold breath for 5 seconds, then breathe out

Step 10:  Remove capsule from inhaler

<!-- image -->

## Twist and pull off the mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

While keeping the inhaler level, close your lips firmly around the mouthpiece.

Take in a deep, comfortable breath until your lungs feel full. This normally takes several seconds.

As you breathe in, you will hear and feel the capsule 'whirl' (spin). The whirl means the inhaler is working and you are getting your medicine.

If you cough or stop your dose, start again from the beginning of Step 7 using the same capsule.

Important: If you did not hear or feel the capsule 'whirl' while inhaling you may need to take a deeper, longer breath or may need to clean the mouthpiece (Do not rinse the mouthpiece or get the inhaler wet). Refer to Step 13 - Clean Mouthpiece. Start again from the beginning of Step 7 using the same capsule.

Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for 5 seconds.

Then breathe out.

Twist and pull off the mouthpiece.

## Remove used capsule

Step 11: Dose with 2nd capsule

<!-- image -->

## Dispose and store

## Step 12:  Dispose of used capsules

Step 13:  Clean Mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

It is normal for some powder to remain in or on the inhaler. To avoid powder buildup, clean the powder off of the mouthpiece holes using a circular motion with a new dry cotton swab as needed.

## Clean holes from the top end of mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

Clean the holes from the top end of the mouthpiece.

Take out the used capsule.

Repeat Steps 4 to 10 with the second capsule to finish the full dose.

You should inhale the contents of the second capsule within 10 minutes of the first one.

Dispose of used capsules in accordance with local requirements.

You can also use a dry tissue to wipe the outside of the mouthpiece, as needed.

Do not rinse the mouthpiece or get the inhaler wet.

## Step 14:  Store inhaler

## Make sure there are no capsules in the inhaler

<!-- image -->

## Attach mouthpiece

<!-- image -->

## Attach cap

<!-- image -->
