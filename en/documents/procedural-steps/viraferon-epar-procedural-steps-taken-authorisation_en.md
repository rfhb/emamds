Medicinal product no longer authorised 1. Submission of the dossier The  applicant  SP  Europe,  73,  rue  de  Stalle,  B-1180  Bruxelles submitted  on  8  March  1999  an application  for  Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal Products (EMEA) for Virtron, through the centralised procedure. The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were: Rapporteur: Dr. E. Abadie Co-Rapporteur: Pharm. G. De Greef Licensing status: The interferon alfa-2b from SP Europe has been already approved in Europe via the ex-concertation procedure with the tradename Viraferon. The Summary of Product Characteristics of Viraferon has been subsequently harmonised through a referral under Article 11 of Council directive 75/319/EEC (submission by the Company on 14 December 1995, CPMP opinion issued on 18 December 1996 and Decision of European Commission on 26 June 1997), during which procedure the whole dossier was assessed by CPMP. The interferon alfa-2b from SP Europe was approved in Europe for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the medicinal product of Viraferon and the centrally approved Virtron are strictly identical. Further  to  the  approval  of  the  centralised  application  of  Virtron,  the  main  changes  of  the  labelling (compared  to  the  article  11  labelling)  relevant  to  the  approved  indications  is  the  inclusion  of  the concomitant administration of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b for the first line treatment of chronic hepatitis C. After the granting of the marketing Authorisation of Virtron by the European Commission, SP Europe committed  to  withdraw  the  nationally  authorised  Viraferon,  and  to  transfer  this  trade  name  to  the centrally authorised product. 2.
