The PRAC agreed on the PRAC Assessment Overview and Advice to CHMP during the meeting on The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Azacitidine Celgene on 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement Disease or condition MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) is a rare and life threatening disease that can affect children and adults, although the highest prevalence occurs in those over 60 years of age. The incidence of MDS has been estimated as 4.1/100,000 population. The incidence rises with increasing age: 4.9 for people aged 50 to 70 years and 22.8 for people older than 70 years. MDS encompasses a group of haematological disorders that is characterised by clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorder, usually of the granulocytic, erythroid or platelet lineage, that results in abnormalities in proliferation, differentiation and maturation of the myeloid lineage. This leads to one or more peripheral cytopenias and progressive bone marrow failure. As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anaemia, infection and bleeding. The clinical presentation of MDS is generally non-specific. However, initial findings of MDS can usually be attributed to the underlying cytopenias. MDS can arise de novo (primary MDS) or following treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or chemical injury (secondary MDS). Depending on the subtype of myelodysplasia, there is a risk of approximately 50% for development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment.

The diagnosis and classification of MDS can be based on two classification systems, the French-American-British (FAB) classification system and the WHO classification system (table 1).

Despite current treatment strategies, approximately half of the patient population with MDS dies within 4 years. Cure may be achieved only in patients who can receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). However, depending on a patient's age and general health condition, best supportive care (BSC), consisting in transfusions, growth factors, iron chelation therapy, is most frequently applied. Otherwise, low-dose chemotherapy or standard combination chemotherapy may be used for the various subclasses of MDS but without a standard approach of care. Only intensive chemotherapy followed by allo HSCT was shown to result in improved survival in patients with Intermediate-2 or high risk MDS or AML that progressed from MDS (AML-MDS) when compared with non-intensive treatment or supportive care only (actuarial survival at 4 years of 26% vs. 10%).

The International Prognostic Scoring System issued in 1997 provides a method for evaluating clinical prognostic risk factors for patients with MDS. The 3 critical factors include risk-based cytogenetic subgroups (good, intermediate, and poor), bone marrow blast percentage and cytopenias. Patients are grouped into 4 risk categories based on total scores from these prognostic factors (table 2). Table 2 IPSS for MDS - Prognostic risk based survival and AML evolution Total Score Value is determined based on the combination of individual score of bone marrow blasts, karyotype and cytopenia Medicinal product no longer authorised

AML evolving from MDS is often less responsive to standard treatment than de novo AML. The usually higher age at diagnosis makes these patients more vulnerable to toxic effects from induction- and consolidation chemotherapy (with e.g., cytarabine, etoposide and idarubicin) and the HSCT.

## About the product

Azacitidine belongs to the group 'anti-metabolites'. Azacitidine is an analogue of cytidine, which means that it is incorporated into the genetic material of cells (RNA and DNA). It is thought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct the problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia.

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Accordingly, the MAH of the reference product, Vidaza, has provided consent to allow access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

Azacitidine Celgene is identical to Vizada, previously approved by the CHMP. The quality, non-clinical, efficacy and safety data for Azacitidine Celgene is therefore considered satisfactory and the benefit-risk profile for Azacitidine Celgene is positive.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 2.7. New Active Substance The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that azacitidine is not a new active substance, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. Azacitidine is contained in the marketing authorisation Vidaza which was authorised in the European Union on 17 December 2008. 2.8. Product information 2.8.1. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product, Vidaza, was the subject of a user testing study, which was completed successfully in January 2008. As the Patient Information Leaflet for Azacitidine Celgene is identical (with the exception of the product name) to that of the reference product, the user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product can be taken to apply equally to Azacitidine Celgene. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance The application has been submitted in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended (Informed consent Application) under automatic access to the centralised procedure.

## 4. Recommendations

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Azacitidine Celgene is not similar to Revlimid, Dacogen, Rydapt, Mylotarg or Vyxeos within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Azacitidine Celgene is favourable in the following indication: Azacitidine Celgene is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with: · intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), · chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, · acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, · AML with &gt;30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification. The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2). Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation Periodic Safety Update Reports The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.
