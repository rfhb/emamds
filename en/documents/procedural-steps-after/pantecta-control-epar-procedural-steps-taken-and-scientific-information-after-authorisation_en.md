1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the renewal could be granted with unlimited validity. authorised                                                           |
| WS/0341 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The Worksharing Applicant (WSA) proposed the update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add an interaction between pantoprazole and methotrexate following the assessment of cases of interaction and published literature in FUMs 13, 12, 12, 18, 13. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the WSA used this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH Medicinal product | 25/04/2013 | 27/05/2013 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer | In a cumulative review of cases of interaction between pantoprazole and methotrexate, including published literature it was shown that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. Current evidence supporting reduced methotrexate elimination in patients receiving PPIs is primarily based on studies conducted in patients receiving high dose treatment, which is usually carried out in a specialist medical setting. Nevertheless, considering the evidence available to date a mention of these facts was added to 4.5 of the SmPC of OTC pantoprazole. |

| WS/0122     | (replacement or addition) This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to add Agranulocytosis, Pancytopenia, Hypomagnesaemia, Taste disorders and Gynaecomastia as new adverse drug reactions based on post-marketing data and literature references. Section 4 of the PL is updated accordingly. Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to bring Medicinal product | 20/10/2011   | 07/12/2011    | Following post marketing surveillance data section 4.8. of the SPC was updated: Agranulocytosis, taste disorder and gynaecomastia were listed as rare side effects. Pancytopenia was added as a very rare side effect and hypomagnesaemia was listed as a side effect of not known frequency. The evidence with regard to hypomagnesaemia in short term use was not deemed sufficient to add an additional safety warning in 4.4. of the SPC for the OTC which are indicated for short-term use only. |
