## 2.3.2. Clinical study mRNA- 1345-P101

## Description

Clinical study mRNA- 1345-P101 is a Phase 1, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Reactogenicity, and Immunogenicity of mRNA-1345, an mRNA Vaccine Targeting Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), in Healthy Younger Adults Aged 18 to 49 Years, Women of Child-Bearing Potential Aged 18 to 40 Years, Healthy Older Adults Aged 65 to 79 Years, Japanese Older Adults Aged ≥ 60 Years, and RSV -Seropositive Children Aged 12 to 59 Months.

This current procedure covers paediatric cohorts 5 and 6 (final analysis with a database lock of 14March-2024) with 18 July 2024 as the End of Study (EoS) date, LPLV 18Jul24, and database lock Dec24.

Study P101 enrolled 2 pediatric cohorts of RSV-seropositive children aged 12 to 59 months.

Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio via interactive response technology to receive either mRNA-1345 30 μ g or placebo (Cohort 5) or mRNA-1345 15 μ g or placebo (Cohort 6). All participants received a 3-dose injection series administered 56 days apart (Day 1, Day 57, and Day 113). Enrollment for Cohort 6 commenced after completion of Cohort 5. Cohort 5 was initiated on 23 Jun 2021 (first participant randomized) and Cohort 6 concluded on 28 Mar 2024 (LPLV).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Study participants were RSV-seropositive children aged 12 to 59 months who had completed routine age-appropriate immunizations according to local guidelines. Participants were required to have height and weight above the third percentile for their age at enrollment

46 Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 injections of 15 µg or 30 µg mRNA-1345 (15 participants and 16 participants, respectively) or placebo (15 participants)

(Reference: Study mRNA-1345-P101 Final CSR Addendum 1 [Pediatric Cohorts] Sections 3.3.1, 5.1 and 5.4)

## Treatments

First injection: all (100%) participants in the mRNA-1345 15 µg and placebo groups, and 15/16 (93.8%) participants in the 30µg group

Second injection: 14/15 (93.3%) and 12/16 (75.0%) participants in the mRNA-1345 15 µg and 30 µg groups, and 11/15 (73.3%) participants in the placebo group

Third injection: 11/15 (73.3%) and 10/16 (62.5%) participants in the mRNA-1345 15 µg and 30 µg groups, and 10/15 (66.7%) participants in the placebo group

All (100%) participants in the mRNA1345 (15 µg and 30 µg) and placebo groups completed ≥28 days of follow-up after the first injection received. 11/15 (73.3%) Participants in the mRNA-1345 15 µg group, 12/15 (80.0%) participants in the mRNA-1345 30 µg group, and 9/15 (60%) participants in the placebo group completed ≥12 months of follow -up after the first injection.

The median duration of follow-up from the first injection across all treatment groups was 451.0 days (range: 34 to 561 days).

## Sample size

A total of 46 pediatric participants were randomly assigned to receive the study intervention resulting in 16 participants in the mRNA-1345 30 μ g group, 15 participants in the mRNA-1345 15 μ g group, and 15 participants in the placebo group.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Two pediatric cohorts (Cohorts 5 and 6) were to be enrolled and randomized in a 3:1 ratio via IRT (Interactive Response Technology) to receive mRNA-1345 or placebo.

## Statistical Methods

The planned analyses, statistical tests, and determination of sample size are described in the SAP (Version 6.0 dated 30 Oct 2023) for the mRNA-1345-P101 study (Appendix 16.1.9).

## Results

## Participant flow

RSV-seropositive children in Cohort 5 received 30 μ g of mRNA-1345 or placebo. After this cohort was fully enrolled, Cohort 6 started enrolling children to receive 15 μ g of mRNA-1345 or placebo. Note that the initial plan had been to dose escalate to 100 µg for Cohort 5, but emerging data from the Sponsor's pediatric COVID-19 vaccine trials suggested that the 100µg dose could result to an increased fever rate, as well as a Grade 4 fever that occurred in a participant in Cohort 5 led to the decision to instead test the lower dose of 15 µg (refer to Protocol Amendment 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

A total of 46 pediatric participants were randomly assigned to receive the study intervention.

Of the 31 participants who received mRNA-1345, 9 (29.0%) participants discontinued the study vaccine. Reasons for study vaccine discontinuation included lost to follow-up, protocol violation, other (fear of needles and at Sponsor request due to low RSV nAb titers at start of study), solicited AE (fever of 105°F), and withdrawal of consent (Listing 16.2.1.1.4).

A total of 22/31 (71.0%) participants in the mRNA-1345 groups and 9/15 (60.0%) participants in the placebo group completed the study. The reasons for study discontinuation for placebo participants were lost to follow-up, protocol violation, withdrawal of consent, and other (Sponsor request due to low RSV nAb titers at start of study).

The reasons for study discontinuation in the mRNA-1345 30 µg group were lost to follow-up and other (1 participant moved 10 hours away and 1 participant missed first injection due to inadequate study supplies onsite). Lost to follow-up was the only reason for study discontinuation in the 15µg group.

No participants discontinued from the study due to an AE in the pediatric cohorts, according to the MAH (Listing 16.2.1.1.4).

## Baseline data

Age in the pediatric cohorts ranged from 17 to 59 months. Mean age was 38.9 months in the mRNA1345 15 µg group, 42.6 months in the mRNA-1345 30 µg group, and 38.4 months in the placebo group.

Gender was balanced in the 15µg group (53.3% male and 46.7% female), while variability was observed in the 30µg group (31.3% male and 68.8% female). The placebo group included 60.0% male and 40.0% female participants.

Of the 46 randomized participants, 29 (63.0%) were White, 10 (21.7%) were Black or African American, 3 (6.5%) identified as other, 3 (6.5%) identified as multiple races, and 1 (2.2%) identified as Asian.

## Immunogenicity results

Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serum nAbs against RSV-A and RSV-B, and bAb titers against the RSV-F protein (both preF and postF conformations). Analyses were conducted at Baseline (Screening), Month 1 (Day 29, 1 month after the first injection), Month 3 (Day 85, 1 month after the second injection), and Month 5 (Day 141, 1 month after the third injection).

Immunogenicity analyses were performed primarily using the PP Set and analyzed by participant cohorts. Key details of statistical analyses that were carried out for immunogenicity are presented in Study mRNA-1345-P101 Final CSR Addendum 1 (Pediatric Cohorts) Section 4.1.4.2.

Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary objective in the study. The study was not designed to evaluate efficacy.

The immunogenicity objective was to evaluate the antibody response to each injection dose level (15 µg or 30 µg) of mRNA-1345 in baseline RSV-seropositive children (Cohort 5 and Cohort 6). Study endpoints included: GMT (IU/mL) of serum RSV nAbs and GMC (AU/mL) of serum RSV bAbs across Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, and Month 5; GMFR of postbaseline/baseline antibody titers; and the proportion of participants with ≥2 -fold and ≥4 -fold increases in antibody titers from Baseline.

- RSV-A and RSV-B nAbs and preF and postF bAbs were confirmed to be present at Baseline in the mRNA-1345 and placebo groups, suggestive of prior exposure to RSV.
- A single injection of mRNA-1345 15 µg and 30 µg increased nAb titers against RSV-A and RSV-B, as well as bAb concentrations against preF and postF. There was no apparent dose response in the Month 1 GMTs/GMCs. Although the Month 1 GMFRs were numerically higher for the mRNA-1345 30 µg group, this was due to lower baseline values compared with the mRNA-1345 15 µg group. The nAb response to mRNA-1345 measured by GMFR was lowest in those participants with the highest baseline antibody titer.
- The Month 1 RSV nAb GMTs in IU/mL for the mRNA-1345 15 µg group, mRNA-1345 30 µg group, and placebo group were 11,440.4, 8376.1, and 642.6, respectively, for RSV-A; and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 5940.3, 4931.9, and 490.2, respectively, for RSV-B. The Month 1 nAb GMFRs for the mRNA-1345 15 µg, mRNA-1345 30 µg, and placebo groups were 18.94, 34.88, and 1.44, respectively, for RSV-A; and 7.21, 14.26, and 1.24, respectively, for RSV-B.
- RSV preF and postF bAbs followed similar trends as the RSV nAbs. At each timepoint after mRNA-1345 vaccination, preF GMFRs were greater than postF GMFRs, suggesting that mRNA-1345 preferentially boosts antibodies to the preF conformation.
- The second and third injections of mRNA-1345 15 µg or 30 µg did not substantially impact neutralizing or binding antibody titers in these initially RSV-seropositive participants.
- Immunogenicity results for the FAS were similar to results for the PP Set.

## Ref Table 10, CSR

Solicited systemic ARs up to 7 days after injection were reported: for 7/14 (50.0%), 7/14 (50.0%), and 4/11 (36.4%) participants in the 15 µg group after the first, second, and third injections, respectively; for 8/15 (53.3%), 1/8 (12.5%), and 4/9 (44.4%) participants in the 30 µg group after the first, second, and third injections, respectively; and for 5/15 (33.3%), 6/11 (54.5%), and 3/9 ( 3.3%) participants in the placebo group after the first, second, and third injections, respectively

One Grade 3 AR was irritability/crying, reported for 1/14 participant in the 15 μ g group after the first injection and 1/9 in the 30 μ g group after the third injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One Grade 4 event of fever was reported by 1/15 participant in the mRNA-1345 30 μ g group, leading to discontinuation (see below).

The most common solicited systemic ARs was irritability/crying, others were loss of appetite, sleepiness, and fever.

The most relevant report is a Grade 4 event of fever reported for 1 participant in the 30 µg group after the first injection, as described below:

- 1 participant with past medical history of recent bilateral otitis media and pneumonia (Day -24 to Day -15 that was treated with amoxicillin) and intermittent rhinorrhea (ongoing at Day 1), received the study investigational product IM on 21 Sep 2021 (Day 1) at 12:00 PM. About 7 hours later, the participant had a body temperature of 100.3°F and received paracetamol (5 mL). The following day, on 22 Sep 2021 (Day 2), around 4:15AM, her body temperature was 105.7°F, which was re-checked a few minutes later, and reported to be 104.7°F. She received paracetamol (5 mL), and 30 minutes later, her body temperature was reported at 102.5°F. A temperature check done 2 hours later showed her to be afebrile. The participant continued receiving paracetamol every 4 hours that same day (22 Sep 2021 [Day 2]). Medical attention was not sought by the parents. The participant remained afebrile on Days 3 to 7 (temperature: 98.5°F to 98.8°F) postinjection. The parents reported this clinical information in the clinical trial eDiary, and the site contacted the parents after receiving a standard alert for high fever above 102.1°F (≥Grade 3 fever). Further IP dosing was discontinued after the event, but the participant remained in the study until completion (Day 457)

This solicited systemic Grade 4 AR, considered causally related to study injection, led to a study pause and was assessed by the DSMB. The DSMB conducted an unblinded safety review and following the safety review, no safety concerns were identified, and the study reopened to enrollment.

## Unsolicited Adverse Reactions (ADRs) throughout the study

Throughout the study (from first injection through EOS), the overall incidence of TEAEs was 11/15 (73.3%) participants with 48 TEAEs in the mRNA-1345 15 µg group, 7/15 (46.7%) participants with 23 TEAEs in the 30 µg group, and 9/15 (60.0%) participants with 52 TEAEs in the placebo group (for details, refer to Table 15).

## Ref Table 14.3.2.2.4.2 (detail), CSR

Except for the MAAE of vomiting reported after the first injection in the 15µg group, all other MAAEs were reported as unrelated to treatment.

## Medically Attended RSV Infections in Placebo Group

3 MAAEs of RSV infection were reported in 3 separate participants, all in the placebo group.

Diagnoses of the 3 RSV infections in the placebo group were by mid-turbinate swab only and not CLIA certified or validated study testing.

## Case 1: 1 participant, Cohort 5 Placebo Group

Event: The participant reported a moderate RSV infection on Study Day 3.

Course: Treatments included prednisone and salbutamol. The condition was medically attended and classified as nonserious. The participant recovered on Study Day 13.

Additional Information: The participant tested positive for parainfluenza virus AB during a clinic visit several months later

Status: The participant completed the study on Study Day 470 (17 Nov 2022).

## Case 2: 1 participant, Cohort 5 Placebo Group

Event: The participant reported a moderate RSV infection on Study Day 48 (Day 12 relative to most recent dose). Site was verbally informed via phone call that RSV was diagnosed by his medical doctor at an external clinic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Course: No treatment was reported. The condition was nonserious and the participant recovered on Study Day 55.

Status: The participant was discontinued from the study by the Sponsor on Study Day 113 (16 Nov 2021) due to 'RSV titers identified [low] at the start of the study.'

## Case 3: 1 participant, Cohort 6 Placebo Group

Event: This participant reported a mild RSV infection beginning on Study Day 117 (Day 57 relative to most recent dose.

Course: No specific treatment was reported. The infection was classified as nonserious and medically attended. The participant recovered on Day 134.

Status: The participant completed the study on Study Day 561 (27 Feb 2024). The participant had a history of asthma, tympanostomy, adenoidectomy, perennial allergic rhinitis, otitis, media. Multiple additional respiratory AEs were reported throughout the study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This current P46-procedure covers two paediatric cohorts of Clinical study mRNA- 1345-P101. Overall 46 participants were RSV-seropositive children aged 17 to 59 months, and received 30 μ g (Cohort 5), 15μ g (Cohort 6), or placebo. All participants received a 3-dose injection series administered 56 days apart.

Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serum nAbs against RSV-A and RSV-B, and bAb titers against the RSV-F protein (both preF and postF conformations). Immunogenicity Results are considered to meet the expectations as presented. With regard to the context of a P46 procedures, no open issues have been identified.

Safety addressed Solicited local and systemic ARs through 7 days after each injection, Unsolicited AEs through 28 days, and SAEs and MAAEs throughout the entire study period.

Frequency and severity of solicited local reactions are within the scope of similar vaccines in this agegroup. Reactogenicity of 30µg is higher than the 15-µg-dose. Reactogenicity of 1 st  versus 2 nd  versus 3 rd injection increases for the 30µg dose. The profile of local ARs was as expected.

Solicited systemic ARs show increased reactogenicity (frequency and severity) for the 30µg-dose compared with 15µg and placebo. This observation regards overall frequencies, but also severity for the observed reports.

The most relevant report is a Grade 4 fever after 1 st  vaccination 'which led to study vaccination discontinuation', a study pause, and the decision to decrease the dosage to 15µg for the next cohort instead of increasing it (up to 100µg). The participant was discontinued from vaccination but remained in the study until completion. As the participant remained in the study without further dosing, this report is not reflected in the 'study discontinuations due to a safety issue'. This is correct for formal reasons, but hides potentially significant information on reactogenicity for the respective age-group and the respective dosage. The MAH is asked to rephrase this case in future reports of this study as 'discontinued from vaccinations' to avoid misunderstandings.

Frequency and profile of unsolicited TAEs does not show a signal regarding PT, SOC, or dosage.

Overall, participant numbers are too low for allowing any generalized conclusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No deaths, no serious ADRs, no AEs of Special Interest have been reported.

Regarding MAAEs no signs of special interest have been described.

RSV-Infections have been documented throughout the study. However, all infections were reported in the Placebo-group. Of note, a clinical hold regarding potential enhancement of RSV infections especially in 4-8mo old infants is ongoing. Concerned is Clinical Study mRNA-1365-P101 Pediatric RSV/hMPV. However, for the herein discussed P46 procedure no implications for the SmPC are to be considered, currently.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

This current P46-procedure covers two paediatric cohorts of Clinical Study mRNA- 1345-P101. Overall 46 participants were RSV-seropositive children aged 17 to 59 months, and received 30 μ g (Cohort 5), 15μ g (Cohort 6), or placebo. All participants received a 3-dose injection series administered 56 days apart.

Safety addressed Solicited local and systemic ARs through 7 days after each injection, Unsolicited AEs through 28 days, and SAEs and MAAEs throughout the entire study period.

RSV-Infections have been documented throughout the study. All documented infections were reported in the placebo-group.

Of note, a clinical hold regarding potential enhancement of RSV infections especially in 4-8mo old infants is ongoing. Concerned is Clinical Study mRNA-1365-P101 Pediatric RSV/hMPV.

Overall, based upon the submitted data, no amendment of the SmPC is considered to be necessary.
