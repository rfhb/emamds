To update the Human Insulin RMP to version 3.1 in order to reclassify the risk of 'Medication errors' (including human error-related medication errors) from an important potential risk to an important identified risk following a Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) request | 11/07/2019   | 03/07/2020 | SmPC and Labelling | Update of SmPC section 4.4 to add the below warning on avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors; this is in line with the existing wording in the Package Leaflet. Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Actraphane and other insulin products. |

|                    | accordance with the Good practice guide on risk minimisation and prevention of medication errors, issued by the PRAC in 2015. Furthermore, in accordance with the updated GVP Module V guidance on RMPs, the Work sharing Applicant (WSA) proposed to remove this risk as it is fully characterised and managed through routine pharmacovigilance and no additional pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures are planned or being currently undertaken. Information regarding the avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors is included in the PIL for the concerned products. In consequence, section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated in order to add a warning on accidental mix-ups/medication. Additionally, the WSA took the opportunity include minor updates to Annex IIIA to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version.

| WS/0273/G   | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC with modified wording regarding effect of alcohol on hypoglycemia following the assessment of the latest PSUR. Update of sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC to modify the wording on lipodystrophy to make it more legible; update to section 4.4 of the SmPC to add new information about \"concomitant illness\" to harmonise with the product information of other insulins; and additionally hypoglycaemia to be moved from section 4.3 to section 4.4. The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.0 rev. 1 and with the SmPC Guideline. Minor changes to the labelling have been made in relation to the implementation of the new design on Novo Nordisk A/S cartons and labels. Lastly, the information relating to counterfeit needles has been deleted and the sentence in section 4.5 of the SmPC with regards to 'Octreotide/lanreotide' has been linguistically improved. C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Changes with   | 18/10/2012   | 19/11/2012   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | The information about the risk of developing lipodystrophy including information on how to reduce this risk has been clarified throughout the product information. This has been done to make the information more legible for both healthcare professionals and patients, and specifically to highlight that rotating the injection site does not necessarily prevent development of lipodystrophy but may help to reduce the risk for such development. In addition, the MAH has provided calculations showing that the human insulin products involved in this procedure can be considered 'sodium-free'. Furthermore, changes to all annexes have been introduced in order to comply with latest version of the QRD template (v. 8.0, rev. 1). The variation also includes changes to sections 4.6 and 4.8 of the SmPC which are based on the recommendations in the SmPC Guideline. The SmPC has also been modified in order to align it with the updates already implemented for other insulin products from the same MAH.   |

| WS/0091   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Further to a CHMP request based on the recommendations from PhVWP, the Product Information (Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated by adding a warning on an increased incidence of heart failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors. In addition to the above the MAH took the opportunity to update annex IIB \"Other conditions\" with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance system. This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested | 17/02/2011   | 17/03/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL    | The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. After the review of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin containing products should include warning on increased cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. Annex IIB \"Other conditions\" was also updated with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance system. |

| II/0037 | The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied for a new needle platform. The current needle platform (i.e. NovoFine) uses a classic thread, while the new needle platform (i.e. NovoTwist) is attached to FlexPen by a bayonet coupling. The modified FlexPen will be able to fit both the NovoFine and the NovoTwist needle. Labelling and package leaflet are consequently updated to reflect the change and to obtain a more user friendly language in the package leaflet. In addition, in order to lower the dose force, three components of the FlexPen will have minor modifications. | 20/11/2008 | 12/12/2008 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Change(s) to container |
