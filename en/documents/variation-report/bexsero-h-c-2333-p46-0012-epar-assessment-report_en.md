- e) For all immunogenicity objectives, responses were also determined to vaccine antigen 287-953 by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).

Safety objectives Primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To assess the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ administered to children at 40 months of age who previously received three doses of the same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P9.

## Secondary

To assess the safety and tolerability of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive children starting at 40 and 60 months of age.

- Study design

This study was an extension of study V72P9. It was conducted as an open-label, single centre study (Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford University Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK).

- Study population /Sample size

57 subjects completed parent study V72P9 and were potentially eligible for the extension study. Of these, 16 and 14 subjects were enrolled into groups 4rMenB and 4rMenB+OMV NZ respectively.

Two groups of newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 months and 60 months of age, were also enrolled into the study. 50 subjects were to be enrolled in each group. 41 subjects were enrolled in group III and 49 subjects were enrolled in group IV.

Subjects eligible to be enrolled in the study were healthy 40-44 months old children who participated and completed the V72P9 study; naive subjects aged 40 to 44 months and 60 to 62 months; for whom a parent/legal guardian has given written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained; available for all the visits scheduled in the study; in good health as determined by: medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator.

- Treatments

Subjects who completed study V72P9 and who met all other enrollment criteria were eligible to participate in this extension study. These subjects were treated as follows:

- o Group I (4rMenB) : Subjects who were vaccinated at 6-8 months of age, two months later and at 12 months of age with rMenB vaccine in Study V72P9 were vaccinated with a single booster dose of rMenB at 40 months of age.
- o Group II (4rMenB+OMV) : Subjects who were vaccinated at 6-8 months of age, two months later, and at 12 months of age with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in study V72P9 were vaccinated with a single booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 40 months of age.
- o Group III (Naive\\_4042) and Group IV (Naive\\_6062) : Two groups of naive subjects were recruited at 40 and 60 months of age and were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart (see below). The pre vaccination antibody level for the group recruited at 40 months of age (group III) served as a baseline to assess antibody persistence at 40 months of age for groups I and II. Responses following the first injection of this group also served as a comparator to evaluate booster responses and the presence of immunological memory for groups I and II. The prevaccination antibody level for the group recruited at 60 months of age (group IV) was to serve as a baseline to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 months of age for groups I through III.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both groups III and IV also provided data on two-dose catch-up vaccinations in children 40 and 60 months of age, as described below.

- o Group III (Naive\\_4042) : Naive subjects recruited at 40 months of age were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 40 and 42 months of age.
- o Group IV (Naive\\_6062) : Naive subjects recruited at 60 months of age were to be vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 60 and 62 months of age.
- Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity endpoints

Serum bactericidal activity was measured against N. meningitidis serogroup B strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. Data were summarized by calculating hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:4 and ≥1:8, and additionally ≥1:5 and percentage of subjects with fourfold increase over baseline. Antibody responses to vaccine antigen 287-953 were also determined by ELISA and summarized by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and four-fold rises.

Antibody persistence and immune responses were interpreted using data from the naive groups of children recruited at 40 months and 60 months of age, as indicated below.

- o Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 40 months of age (Group III) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 40 months of age for Groups I and II.
- o Responses to the first catch-up dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive subjects at 40 months of age (Group III) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate the booster response and, in turn, the presence of immunological memory in Groups I and II.
- o Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 60 months of age (Group IV) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 months of age post-boost in Groups I and II and post-two catch-up doses in Group III.

## Safety endpoints

All subjects who received at least one dose of investigational vaccine and provided post vaccination safety data (defined as the safety population) were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive

## Local and Systemic Adverse Events

Incidences of local adverse events (i.e., pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and systemic reactions (i.e., fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥38°C], change in eating habits, sleepiness, irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring during the 7 days following each rMenB±OMV NZ vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group. Additionally, the numbers of subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) within 7 days of rMenB±OMV NZ vaccination were summarized. Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized as none, 0&lt; -10 mm, 10- &lt; 25 mm, 25- &lt; 50 mm, 50 -&lt; 100 mm and ≥ 100 mm. Temperature taken by the axillary route were categorized as &lt; 38°C, 38- &lt; 38.5°C, 38.5- &lt; 39°C, 39 -&lt; 39.5°C, 39.5- &lt; 40°C and ≥ 40°C. All other systemic reactions were categorized as none, mild, moderate or severe.

## Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. AEs that require a medical visit and/or resulting in premature withdrawal from the study, as well as serious adverse events (SAEs), were collected throughout the study period, except for the 7 days after each study vaccination in which all AEs were collected.

All reported AEs, as well as AEs at least possibly related to rMenB±OMV NZ vaccine were summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. These summaries were presented by treatment group. When an AE occurred more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine was counted. Additionally, three separate summaries of AEs were generated as follows: (i) SAEs, (ii) AEs that are possibly or probably related to vaccine, and (iii) AEs that are unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of all AEs were provided by subject. In addition, a summary of the primary termination reasons, a listing of subjects withdrawn from the study because of an AE, and a listing of all termination reasons were presented.

- Statistical Methods

Due to the small sample sizes, the analyses of safety and immunogenicity were purely descriptive. As such, no statistical tests were performed.

The primary analyses of the immunogenicity results were based on the modified Intention-to-treat population (MITT). All safety analyses were based on the safety population.

##  Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed

In total, 120 subjects were enrolled in this extension study. This included 16 subjects in the 4rMenB vaccine group, 14 subjects in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine group, 41 subjects in the Naive\\_4042 vaccine group and 49 subjects in the Naive\\_6062 vaccine group. Of these, a total of 102 subjects (85%) from all the vaccine groups completed the study, as per the criteria specified in the protocol. The primary reason for withdrawal of subjects was 'Withdrawal of Consent' (10 subjects), followed by 'Lost to Follow-up' (6 subjects). A summary of reasons for study termination in all vaccine groups is presented in Table 10.1-1. 115 subjects were part of immunogenicity MITT analysis for persistency and 108 subjects were part of the immunogenicity PP analysis for persistency (table 11.1-1).

Of the 120 subjects enrolled in the study, 119 subjects received at least one study injection and were thus included in the safety analyses.

Source: Table 14.1.1.1; PP - per protocol; MITT - modified intention-to-treat; *Naive subjects recruited at 40 months of age were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 40 and 42 months of age; b naive subjects recruited at 60 months of age were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 60 and 62 months of age

Assessor´s comment: It is noted that the number of enrolled subjects is limited and that about half of the eligible subjects from the parent study were enrolled into this extension study. It is also noted that the proportion of withdrawals was considerably higher in group Naive\\_4042 than in other groups. The study groups are small and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should therefore be made with caution. Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study.

- Baseline data

Overall the demographic and other baseline characteristics for the enrolled population in all four vaccine groups were similar, except for the gender differences. There was an unequal distribution of males and females in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ, Naive\\_4042 and Naive\\_6062 vaccine groups. Higher percentages of females were enrolled in the 4rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine group (79%) and Naive\\_4042 vaccine group (54%). In the Naive\\_6062 vaccine group, higher percentages of males (57%) were enrolled.

- Efficacy results

## Primary endpoint

To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 40 months of age who previously received three doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ as infants in parent study V72P9

Prior to booster vaccination at 40 months of age, GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects in the vaccinated group had decreased to low levels approaching baseline and were comparable to those of the naïve group for all reference strains except strain 5/99. For strain 5/99 vaccinated subjects had a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean GMT of 29 (18-47) compared to 1 (1-1) of naive subjects, and 100% of vaccinated subjects were seropositive whereas none of the naïve subjects were seropositive.

Assessor´s comment: The decrease in GMTs and proportion of seropositive subjects was not unexpected and could indicate the need for a booster vaccination at 40 months of age. However, the number of subjects is very small, and confirmation is needed from larger studies.

## Secondary endpoints

- a. To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ administered at 40 months of age to children who previously received three doses of the same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P9.

One month post booster or first vaccination in the extension study subjects receiving booster vaccinations had higher levels of GMTs and a greater proportion of subjects were seropositive as compared to naïve individuals indicating the presence of immunological memory. The levels of GMTs after booster at 40 months of age were at the same level or slightly lower than those induced by the third vaccination dose at 12 months of age (table 11.4.1.1-1, primary endpoint).

Source: Table 14.2.1.1.3; hSBA - human Serum Bactericidal Assay, MenB - N. meningiidis serogroup B: d Naive subjects recruited at 40 months of age were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 40 and 42 months of age: * Naive subjects recruited at 60 months of age were vaccinated with two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months apart, at 60 and 62 months of age; results for naive\\_4042 group are baseline, 1 month post 1 injection, and 18 months post 2 dose catch up: results for Naive\\_6062 are baseline and 1 month post 2\"d injection

Following the second vaccination an increase in GMTs was demonstrated for all strains in both groups. Levels were, however lower than those of group 4rMenB+OMV one month after the second the injection at 8-10 months of age for all strains except NZ98/254 (see table 11.4.1.1-1, primary endpoint). At 18 months after the second injection a decrease in GMTs was demonstrated.

Assessor´s comment: although it appears that the levels of GMTs induced after two vaccinations in children aged 40/42 or 60/62 months are lower than those in children vaccinated before 12 months of age the clinical relevance of this is unclear.

- d. To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 60 months of age who received a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to naive children at 40 and 42 months of age in the present extension study

Booster vaccination induced a marked increase in GMC levels for all strains. After 20 months levels had declined but were still above baseline. Two vaccinations given to naïve subjects induced a clear increase in GMCs, but at a lower level than in subject receiving the full primary vaccination schedule + booster.

Assessor's general comment on efficacy results:

Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should be made with caution. Responses presented in this extension study are comparative to what has been presented from other studies and there is no concern to indicate reduced immunogenicity of vaccination from the data presented here.

It is noted that baseline values for strain M10713 in the newly recruited groups Naive\\_4042 and Naive\\_6062 are high. The analytical method for this strain was, however, subject to discussion during initial assessment, and the ELISA was also considered relevant. This issue will not be commented on further in this report.
