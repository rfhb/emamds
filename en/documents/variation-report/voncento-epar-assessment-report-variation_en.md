Extension of indication for Voncento to include prophylactic treatment of patients with Von Willebrand Disease (VWD); in addition, the product information has been updated to provide data on the treatment of paediatric patients with VWD. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The package leaflet was updated accordingly.

Moreover, the MAH took the opportunity to correct the manufacturing sites addresses in Annex II and to make editorial changes to the product information.

The group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling, Package Leaflet and Annex II.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0123/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0123/2014 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is a clinically heterogeneous group of disease variants, each characterized by distinct quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in VWF, resulting in defective or deficient function. The prevalence of VWD is reported to be as high as 1-2% in the general population (Mannucci MD, 2004). Patients with VWD are classified into Types 1, 2, and 3.

Type 1: A quantitative defect, in which there are proportional reductions in the levels of the VWF Antigen (VWF:Ag) and VWF function as measured by VWF Ristocetin Cofactor activity VWF:RCo) or Collagen Binding capacity (VWF:CB); reduced level of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C). Type I VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder and is the most commonly documented form of VWD, accounting for 70-80% of cases.

Type 2 accounts for approximately 20% of all diagnosed cases; Type 2A: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag and characterised by absence of HMW multimers; reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 2A VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder. Type  2B: Qualitatively  defective  VWF  in  which  the  levels  of  VWF:RCo  and  VWF:CB  are low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag; increased affinity to platelet glycoprotein Ibα results in loss of HMW multimers  and  thrombocytopenia;  reduced  or  normal  level  of  FVIII:C.  Type  2B  VWD  is  an  autosomal dominant disorder. Type 2M: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag; no loss of HMW multimers, reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 2M VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder. Type 2N: Qualitatively defective VWF in which there is a decreased affinity (abnormal binding) to FVIII; reduced level of FVIII:C. Type 2N VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder.

Type 3: Severe deficiency of VWF characterised by VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and FVIII:C levels typically &lt;5% (or virtually immeasurable). Type 3 VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder and it is the rarest form of VWD, it accounts for 1-3% of cases.. Type 3 VWD is very rare and occurs in approximately 1 in 300,000 - 500,000 individuals.

Most patients with Type 1 VWD and sometimes those with Type 2 N VWD may be treated satisfactorily with DDAVP, which releases endogenous VWF from endothelial cells, but for the other types of VWD use of a VWF/FVIII concentrate is necessary in order to achieve haemostasis during bleeds or surgery.

Fibrinolytic inhibitors such as tranexamic acid are frequently also used during bleeds and surgery. Voncento is  a  human  coagulation  factor  VIII  (FVIII)/von  Willebrand  Factor  (VWF)  complex  and  belongs  to  the pharmacological class of haemostatic agents. This product is administered by intravenous infusion to raise FVIII and VWF levels in patients with corresponding deficiencies. VWF and FVIII are 2 distinct glycoproteins that circulate in plasma in the form of a non-covalently bound complex. Both factors are essential for normal haemostasis  in  humans.  Defects  in  the  VWF/FVIII  complex  underlie  2  distinct  hereditary  coagulation disorders:  von  Willebrand's  disease  (VWD)  and  haemophilia  A.  Marketing  authorization  was  granted  in August 2013.

In this variation submission, the MAH applies for an extension of indication for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex to include prophylactic treatment of patients with VWD as follows:

'Prophylaxis and t Treatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated.'

The initial Marketing authorisation application (MAA) in Europe included the interim study report for study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 that presented the results up to the Month 12 visit. In this submission, the interim study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

report  was  replaced  by  the  final  study  report  which  included  an  additional  12  months  of  prophylaxis treatment results, completing the entire 24-month treatment period of the study.

Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposes  to  revise  the  paediatric  information  in  various  sections  of  the  SmPC, following  the  completion  of  Study  CSL-CT-08-52  in  children  ≤12  years  old  with  VWD.  Additionally,  an abbreviated study report summarising the results of the discontinued study on immune tolerance induction (ITI) treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex (study CSLCT-BIO-10-67) was provided to the EMA in June 2014 via an Article 46 submission to update the dossier accordingly.

This application proposes changes in the following main areas of the SmPC.

- -The currently approved  VWD indication:

'Treatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated' is revised as follows:

'Prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated.'

- -Posology section:

As the approved indication so far does not specify age, only a statement in SPC Section 4.2 that 'The safety and efficacy of Voncento in children &lt;12 years have not been established. No data are available.'

The MAH proposes to modify SPC Section 4.2 so that this statement only refers to haemophilia A and to include statements on dosing which would be applicable to paediatric patients from age 1 year and older.

## Paediatric development

A Paediatric Investigation plan (PIP) has been approved by the PDCO with modifications (P/0123/2014), in May 2014. In accordance with the PIP, this post-approval variation presents data from clinical studies performed  by  CSL  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF,  including  new  data  on  the  on-demand  and prophylaxis treatment in children with VWD.

The  following  waiver  was  agreed  on  the  grounds  that  clinical  studies  could  not  be  expected  to  be  of significant therapeutic benefit to or fulfil a therapeutic need of the paediatric population:

- -In the treatment of hereditary Factor VIII deficiency (Haemophilia A)

The waiver applies to infants from birth to less than 28 days;-

## Deferral of completion

Deferral has been agreed on the completion of 3 studies in children under 12 years. Data from two of these studies  (CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  the  terminated  study  CSLCT-BIO-10-67)  were  submitted  during  this procedure.  In  accordance  with  the  PIP,  paediatric  data  regarding  children  aged  &lt;12 years  with haemophilia A from the ongoing clinical study (CSLCT-BIO-08-53) will be submitted after finalisation of the study.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted - as per the initial application for the MA for Voncento. The MAH has not performed an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in accordance with the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the medicinal products for human  use'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) - as Voncento is a naturally derived substance and a protein, unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

A paediatric PK, safety, and efficacy study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in VWD patients was submitted in support of the current application. A total of 17 subjects were enrolled and treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, 4 with a prophylaxis regimen (Arm 1) and 13 with an on-demand regimen (Arm 2). The mean age of the included patients was 5.2 years (age range 0-11.0 years) with 9 subjects (52.9%) aged &lt;6 years. Seven subjects (41.2%) were male, 10 (58.8%) female. All but 2 subjects were Caucasian. All subjects participated in the initial PK assessment, and 9 subjects with VWD Type 3 participated in the repeat PK assessment. All subjects completed the Month 12 visit.

PK samples were collected immediately prior to dosing and then at 0.5, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after the infusion. Samples for determination of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and FVIII:C were taken at each PK time point.

Descriptive statistics for the main PK parameters for baseline-adjusted VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB are summarised  in  table  2.  Following  infusion  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex,  plasma concentrations of all VWF markers increased immediately, reaching Cmax at 30 min post-dose, and then declined over time with mean terminal t1/2 of 10.3-11.5 h and MRT of 12.7-14.6 h. Profiles of concentrations over time were similar between VWF markers; mean baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations for VWF:RCo were slightly lower than for VWF:Ag and VWF:CB.

Following  repeat  treatment  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  at  6  months,  mean  plasma concentrations for all VWF markers were comparable to those from the initial PK infusion (Table 3): there was no evidence of alterations which would suggest the development of inhibitors to Voncento.

Due to dose calculation errors, 3 subjects received incorrect doses and had major PK deviations. For these subjects,  the  dose  calculation  was  erroneously  based  in  FVIII:C  instead  of  VWF:RCo,  which  led  to administration of higher doses instead of the prescribed dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg (195.6 and 198.2 IU VWF:RCo/kg at initial and repeat PK; 157.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg and 157.4 IU VWF:RCo/kg at initial PK ). To

minimize the interference from inaccurate dosing, another set of PK parameters was generated by excluding these 3 subjects. Compared to the full PK dataset, incremental recovery, t1/2, Cl, and Vss were similar. AUC and Cmax were lower compared with the full PK population; this was attributable to the high doses in the 3 excluded subjects.

Comparison of the PK for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB obtained in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 with PK data obtained in adults in Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (Table 4), shows that VWF PK parameters, such as incremental recovery are higher in VWD patients &gt; 12 years, yielding increased  Cmax and AUC, in the &gt;12 years population as compared to the &gt;6 and 6 &lt; 12 years population. In line with this, t1/2 generally appears longer in the &gt;12 years population as compared to the &lt;6 years and 6 &lt; 12 years population.

## Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses

In order to characterise the PK of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in adult and paediatric populations with  VWD  PK  data  obtained  from  pivotal  VWD  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-54,  were combined in a population PK analyses. Next to the type of VWD, only weight appears to be a significant covariate.  Weight  was  shown  a  covariate  both  for  V  and  Cl.  When  weight  is  included,  age  was  not  a significant covariate. The model was based on data obtained in adults (CSLCT-BIO-08-54) as well as in paediatric patients (Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52).

Model-predicted  VWF:RCo  exposures  vs  age  were  conducted  using  the  population  PK  model  which incorporated weight on CL and V, model-predicted AUC and Cmax were obtained by non-compartmental calculations of model-derived (post-hoc) VWF:RCo concentrations predicted individually for each PK sample time point. Thus, predictions of VWF:RCo exposures for different ages after an initial dose were possible due to the presence of weight in the model. There is a consistent pattern in this relationship when comparing the observed exposures versus age to the model predicted exposures versus weight. In addition, it can be observed that VFW:RCo exposure appeared to modestly decrease when age was less than 6 years old.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

A paediatric PK, safety, and efficacy study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in VWD patients was submitted in support of the current application. This paediatric study was compliant with the requirements of the CHMP guideline on the clinical investigation of human plasma-derived VWF products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02) and the guideline on the Core SmPC for human plasma derived VWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02).

Overall, the pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients with von Willebrand disease are very similar to those observed in the adult population.

PK of single dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight was evaluated in paediatric subjects less than 12 years of age with severe VWD. Following infusion, peak concentrations of VWF markers (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB) and FVIII:C were achieved immediately with a mean IR of 0.013-0.016 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for VWF markers and 0.017-0.021 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for FVIII:C. The elimination t1/2 of VWF markers was between 9.7 and 12.9 h whereas FVIII:C had a longer t1/2 of approximately 18 h due to a plateau effect that may represent the net effect of decreasing levels of exogenous FVIII, combined with increasing endogenous FVIII levels. PK parameters from the repeat PK evaluation were similar to those from initial PK. Voncento exposure and disposition were comparable between &lt;6-year-old and 6-12-year-old subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, PK parameters such as incremental recovery are higher in VWD patients &gt; 12 years, yielding increased Cmax and AUC, in the &gt;12 years population as compared to the &lt;6 and 6- 12 years population. In line with this, t1/2 generally appears longer in the &gt;12 years population as compared to the &lt;6 years and 6-12 years population.

The VWF and FTVIII PK data in VWD patients &lt; 6 years and 6 -12 years are summarised in the SmPC, in order to provide relevant information to prescribers (see section 5.2).

Dosing errors were made in 3 out of 17 paediatric subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. For these subjects, the dose calculation was erroneously based in FVIII:C instead of VWF:RCo, which led to administration of higher doses instead of the prescribed dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg. The impact of these dosing errors on the PK conclusions appears limited based on the sensitivity analysis conducted. The MAH agreed to include medication  errors as a potential risk in the  RMP.  The  risk  will  be  monitored  through  routine pharmacovigilance, and any new data on the potential risk will be reviewed in the upcoming PSURs (see also RMP).

The population pharmacokinetic model appears to be sufficiently validated and to provide a reasonable description of the VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB pharmacokinetics. In the observed VWF plasma-concentration  time  plots,  provided  in  the  report  for  Population  PK  study  RA21020033,  it  was apparent that the AUC and Cmax seem higher in the adult population as compared to the &lt;12 years population,  as  noted  in  in  the  discussion  of  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52.  VWF  incremental  recovery  and exposure in the VWD paediatric population &lt;12 years seems to be lower than in VWD patients &gt;12 years.

The provided data confirm that dosing based on weight is appropriate. Further, the predicted exposures are reasonably in line with observed exposures. Dose/kg-normalised AUC and Cmax are somewhat lower in the population &lt;12 years, as compared to the population &gt; 12 years. This lower exposure should be indicated in the SmPC. It is acknowledged that the lower incremental recovery in VWF patients &lt; 12 years supports the higher dose used in this population as compared to the &gt; 12 years population.

Final  dosing  recommendations  based  on  the  above  results  have  been  agreed  in  the  SmPC  (see  also discussion on Clinical Efficacy):

## Prophylaxis treatment

For long term prophylaxis in patients with VWD, a dose of 25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg body weight should be considered at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeds or menorrhagia, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.

## Paediatric VWD population

## Treatment of bleeding

Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed.

## Prophylaxis treatment

Patients aged 12 to 18 years old: Dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults.

Patients aged &lt;12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 years of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 - 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2).

The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacokinetic data submitted in support of this variation are satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PK analysis, including the data from the 17 subjects &lt;12 years, confirms that VWF incremental recovery and  exposure  in  the  VWD  paediatric  population  &lt;12  years  is  lower  than  in  VWD  patients  &gt;12  years, supporting the higher prophylactic dose used in this population as compared to the &gt; 12 years population. Recommendations have been included in the SmPC Section 4.2 accordingly.

The VWF and FTVIII PK data in VWD patients &lt; 6 years and 6 years &lt; 12 years are summarised in the SmPC, section 5.2 in order to provide relevant information to prescribers.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main studies

## CSLCT-BIO-08-54

This was a Phase II/III, multi-centre, open-label study to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of Voncento in subjects  with  severe  VWD.  As  pivotal  trial  for  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Voncento  in  VWD,  study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 has been described in detail for the MAA. Only information necessary for understanding the claimed extension of the indication to routine prophylaxis are presented in this assessment report.

Altogether, the study consisted of 3 periods:

- Screening period of up to 28 days.
- PK component of up to 183 days (PK subjects).
- Efficacy component with 3 arms:

Arm1 Prophylaxis (only one subject enrolled), Arm 2 On-demand treatment of bleeding events and Arm 3  in which subjects could continue in order to obtain routine prophylaxis after completing Arm 2.

Concerning routine prophylaxis, in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 one patient was treated from the start with a routine prophylaxis regimen in Arm 1 and 8 subjects from Arm 2 continued into Arm 3 in which they received a routine prophylaxis regimen.

## Methods CSLCT-BIO-08-54

## Study participants

## Main Inclusion criteria

1. Male and female subjects who were at least 12 years of age.
2. Diagnosed with severe VWD where VWF:RCo was &lt;15% at screening (after a minimum of 5 days since last VWF treatment) or the subject had a history of VWF:RCo &lt;10% documented in their medical notes at enrolment.
3. Where DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available.
4. Required a VWF product for prophylactic therapy or to control an NSB event.

## Main Exclusion criteria

Subjects who fulfilled any of the following criteria were not eligible for inclusion into this study:

For participants of the PK component:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Were actively bleeding immediately prior to the initial PK period.
2. Received DDAVP or a VWF product in the 5 days prior to their first dose of study product.
3. Had Type 2B, 2N, or 2M VWD.

## For all subjects:

4. Required a VWF product for a planned surgical procedure at enrolment i.e. a planned surgery should not have been the reason for inclusion into the study.

5. Received aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days prior to their first dose of study product.

6. Known history of or were suspected to have VWF or FVIII inhibitors.

## Assignment to treatment arms

Prophylaxis arm (Arm 1): Subjects who were being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product at the time of study entry, or who were not on a set prophylaxis regimen but in whom prophylaxis treatment was justifiable in the opinion of the investigator, were enrolled into Arm 1 with a final visit after 12 months

On-demand arm (Arm 2): Subjects who were not being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product at the time of study entry,

Arm 3: Subjects, who completed on-demand treatment in Arm 2 and who at the Month 12 visit qualified to be switched to a set prophylactic regimen according to the pre-specified criteria given below  entered Arm 3 to receive prophylaxis with Voncento for 12 months.

Eligibility to be switched to Arm 3 was assessed by the investigator using the following criteria as a guideline:

- Joints: either ≥3 spontaneous bleeding events in the same joint or ≥3 spontaneous bleeding events in various joints over a 6-month period.

- Gastrointestinal: &gt;2 gastrointestinal bleeding events over a 12-month period.
- Epistaxis: ≥5 severe epistaxis episodes requiring Voncento treatment or erythrocyte transfusion over a 6-month period.
- Menorrhagia uncontrolled by the contraceptive pill or tranexamic acid.
- More than 1 bleeding event per month at any site requiring Voncento treatment over a 6-month period.
- Investigator's opinion in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

These criteria for continuation into Arm 3 reflect a clinically severe disease profile in patients likely to  benefit from routine prophylaxis and are considered to be appropriate.

## Treatments

Duration of treatment was 12 months for Arm 1 and Arm 2 and 24 months for those who continued from Arm 2 into Arm 3.

The frequency and dose of administration during the efficacy component was determined by the investigator using the schedule given in Table 6 as a guide.

## Objectives

## Primary objectives

1. To investigate the initial and repeat PK profile of Voncento in subjects with severe VWD.
2. To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in subjects with VWD who require a VWF product to control an NSB event.
3. To assess the effectiveness of a prophylaxis regimen as compared to on-demand therapy with Voncento in preventing NSB events.

## Secondary objectives

1.  To  assess  the  safety  of  Voncento  used  both  as  on-demand  therapy  to  treat  NSB  events  and  as prophylactic therapy.
2. To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento for subjects who undergo surgical procedures during the study period.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoints include:

- Haemostatic Efficacy assessed as in table 6.
- Blood product transfusion requirements, and the number of treatments/units required to resolve any bleeding event
- VWF:RCo/ FVIII:C concentrate usage: number of infusions, IU/kg per dose, per event, per month and per year.
- Assessment of blood loss during any surgical procedure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- An assessment in the number of spontaneous or traumatic NSB events on a monthly basis and overall

## Secondary endpoints include:

1. The nature and incidence of adverse events (including the development of FVIII and/or VWF  inhibitors)
2. Assessment of haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in usage for a surgical event according to a 4 point ordinal scale, need for transfusion and assessment of blood loss.

## Haemostasis assessment

Clinical efficacy parameters were haemostasis, number of bleeding events, study product usage, blood product transfusion requirements, and surgeon's assessment of blood loss during a surgical procedure.

Haemostasis was to be assessed overall every 3 months by the investigator and monthly by the subject, and for each NSB and surgical event by the investigator and subject.

Overall clinical assessments of haemostatic efficacy were done by the investigator in conjunction with the subject (or legal guardian) based on a 4-point efficacy grading scale outlined in Table 7.

The severity of NSB events was assessed by the investigator as major or minor. Major NSB events included any bleeding into a joint or muscle, or a mucosal bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract (excluding nasal or oral bleeding). All other NSB events were classified as minor unless the investigator assessment noted otherwise.

## Sample size

The number of subjects was based on the CHMP guideline [CPMP/BPWG/220/02] which requires at least 12 subjects with VWD to take part in a PK study, 6 of whom should have Type 3 VWD.

## Randomisation

The study was uncontrolled.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was open label.

## Statistical methods

Continuous variables were summarised using descriptive statistics: number of non-missing values, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The sample size was estimated in line with the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02).

Per the statistical analysis plan, no formal statistical tests were to be performed but a descriptive approach to data analysis was used.

## Results

## Participant flow

Twenty two (22) patients, including 3 adolescents, were treated in the study thus comprising the safety population. One patient was included in the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) and 21 in the on demand arm (Arm 2). All patients completed the 12-month visit. The efficacy population used for the efficacy evaluation included all 21 patients who received study drug and had at least 1 NSB after baseline with an available haemostatic efficacy assessment.

Fifteen (15) patients participated in the PK component and 8 of these, all from the on-demand arm (Arm 2) and all with Type 3 VWD, were assessed for the repeat PK evaluation.

Eight (8) patients from on demand Arm 2 (but none of the adolescent subjects) including 6 with Type 3 VWD, entered Arm 3 thus switching to prophylaxis for 12 months. One subject (Type 3 VWD) withdrew his consent and discontinued treatment after 10.5 months in Arm 3. Thus 7 subjects completed the study after 24 months, with 12 months on a prophylaxis regimen.

## Recruitment

A total of 22 subjects were recruited and received study drug in 6 centres. The first subject enrolled on 30 June 2009. The last subject completed the Month 12 visit on 6 March 2011 and the last subject completed the Month 24 visit on 16 February 2012.

## Conduct of the study

There were 3 substantial protocol amendments and 2 protocol deviations which are not considered to have impacted the validity of the efficacy and safety data.

Amendment 3 which was addition of the inclusion criterion of 'DDAVP unavailable', while allowing use of Voncento in a real-life situation, may have allowed inclusion of patients with milder bleeding episodes. This was of concern in the assessment for the MAA but it was concluded that the amendment had not negatively impacted the data and that efficacy of Voncento in VWD had been adequately demonstrated.

For the assessment of the data for an indication in routine prophylaxis it is not of relevance as DDAVP would not be used in prophylaxis.

## Baseline data

All subjects were Caucasian, 10 (45.5%) were male and 12 (54.5%) female, and the mean age was 33.6 years (range: 15-68 years). Three adolescent subjects (aged 12 - &lt;18 years) participated in Arm 2 of the study (2 subjects aged 15 years and 1 subject aged 16 years and none of them continued into Arm 3.

## Numbers analysed

Efficacy results were based on the efficacy population (treated subjects who had at least 1 NSB event after baseline with an available haemostatic efficacy assessment).

This consisted of 1 subject in Arm 1 (prophylaxis) and 20 subjects in Arm 2 (on-demand) in the first 12 months of the study, and 8 subjects in Arm 3 who received prophylaxis treatment during Months 13-24 (after being treated on-demand in Arm 2).

## Outcomes and estimation

## Study Drug Dosage

In pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 the 20 patients in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) had a median number of 20.0 infusions (range: 3-92). The mean (SD) average dose per infusion was 37.8 (8.7) IU VWF:RCo/kg and the median average dose per infusion was 36.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 29 - 64 IU/kg).

The 8 subjects who later went on to prophylaxis in Arm 3, first received a higher median number of 30.5 infusions (range: 18 92) at a median average dose per infusion of 37.2 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 29-46 IU/kg), during their 12 month period of on-demand treatment in Arm 2.

On the prophylaxis regimen in Arm 3, their median number of infusions increased to 72.5 IU (range: 16-118) and the median average dose per infusion decreased to 28.8 IU VWF:RCo/kg.

In prophylaxis treatment Arm 3, their median total prophylaxis dose of IMP was 1843.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 539.7 - 4110.2 IU/kg).

The one patient included in the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) participated in the study for 15 months. She received 197 infusions with 37.9 IU VWF:RCo/kg IMP per infusion administered every 2-3 days, and 2 additional infusions of 55.3 and 27.7 IU VWF:RCo/kg, to treat a major mucosal NSB event.

Her total amount of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex received 7470.7 IU VWF:RCo/kg.

## Number of bleeding events during on-demand treatment (Arm 2)

The 20 subjects of Arm 2 reported 533 NSB events during the study, (median 19.5 NSB events per subject, range of 2 to 82 events (Table 9). The majority of NSB events in Arm 2 were spontaneous [99.2%]), minor [76.5%], and mucosal [78.2%]. Eight subjects reported 125 major NSB events.

Six subjects had 126 NSB events that did not require treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and which were consequently not assessed for haemostatic efficacy.

## Number of bleeding events during prophylaxis (Arm 3 and Arm 1)

Compared  to  the  on-demand  treatment,  there  were  very  few  bleeds  experienced  by  the  subjects  on prophylaxis. Of the 8 subjects in Arm 3, only 5 subjects reported bleeds. There was a total of 10 bleeds in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these 5 subjects with a median number of 1 event (range: 1-6 events) per subject during prophylaxis compared to 26.5 events (range 18-82) while receiving on-demand treatment in Arm 2.

All 10 NSB events were spontaneous, 7 were minor and 8 were mucosal. Two subjects in Arm 3 experienced a total of 3 major NSB events, including 1 major mucosal NSB event which was a gastrointestinal bleed and was treated with additional Voncento.

The single subject in Arm 1 had a higher number of bleeds on prophylaxis than the subjects in Arm 3, reporting 10 NSB events during her 15-months prophylaxis. All bleeds were spontaneous and mucosal; 2 were minor and 8 major. The subject only treated 1 major mucosal event outside of her prophylaxis regimen with additional human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

The number and type of bleeds experienced in Arm 2 by the 8 subjects who went on to receive prophylaxis is given in Table 11.

During prophylaxis, there were 3 major bleeds in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint bleeds. In comparison, in the same 8 subjects during on-demand treatment, 5 subjects experienced a median of 7.0 major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median of  34 joint bleeds (range 7 to 58).

## Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis: investigator and subjects' assessment

In Arm 3 (prophylaxis), haemostatic efficacy after treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was assessed by the investigator as excellent in the treatment of all 10 NSB events and also generally for all subjects at every 3-month interval.

All subjects in Arm 3 with an available monthly assessment also assessed the haemostatic efficacy of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as excellent for each month.

One patient experienced a major spontaneous mucosal bleed in the gastrointestinal tract that lasted for 3 days  and  was  treated  with  additional  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex.  The  overall  haemostatic efficacy of this event was assessed as excellent by both the investigator and the subject

While receiving on-demand treatment in Arm 2, these 8 subjects had experienced 304 bleeds including 116 major bleeds, 99 joint bleeds and 16 muscle bleeds. Haemostatic efficacy was rated by the investigator as excellent in more than 98% of all bleeds.

The single subject in Arm 1 reported haemostatic efficacy ranging as being usually excellent to moderate over the 15 month period. Only 1 of the 10 bleeds she experienced was treated with additional human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and efficacy for this event was reported as good by both the investigator and subject. Haemostatic efficacy ranged from excellent to moderate over the 15 month period. Only 1 of the 10 bleeds she experienced was treated with additional human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and efficacy for this event was reported as good by both the investigator and patient.

## Ancillary analyses

The MAH  presented an analysis of subjects who switched from on-demand (Arm 2) to prophylaxis treatment (Arm 3) compared to those who did not switch.

The  sub-group  of  patients  who  went  on  to  routine  prophylaxis  in  Arm  3  had  more  severe  disease  as evidenced by the higher median number of bleeding events (26.5, range 18 to 82) of which more than one third were rated as major. In comparison those subjects who did not go on to routine prophylaxis had a lower number of bleeds (median 12, range 2 to 69) and only 9% of bleeds were major. This would be in keeping with the higher proportion of subjects with Type 3 VWD amongst those who went on to receive routine prophylaxis.

It is notable that haemostatic efficacy was more often reported as excellent (98.4% of bleeds) in Arm 2 in those who went on to routine prophylaxis compared to 73.8% of bleeds in those not considered suitable for routine prophylaxis. It can be speculated that this may reflect a choice of the investigator in choosing those who responded well to treatment with Voncento to go on to routine prophylaxis.

Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  routine  prophylaxis  treatment  regimen  was  very  successful  in preventing all types (i.e. mucosal, joint and muscle) of spontaneous bleeding events.

## Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52

This was a Phase III, multi-centre, open-label study to investigate the PK, efficacy, and safety of Voncento in  paediatric  subjects  with  VWD in whom treatment with a VWF product was required for prophylactic therapy,  haemostatic  control  during  surgery,  or  control  of  a  non-surgical,  spontaneous,  or  traumatic bleeding event.

The  Applicant  has  submitted  the  PDCO  Opinion  on  compliance  by  20/06/2014  in  which  study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 was considered to be compliant.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Main Inclusion criteria

Subjects who fulfilled the following criteria were eligible for inclusion:

1. Male and female subjects between 0 and &lt;12 years of age.
2. Subjects who had been diagnosed with VWD Type 1, 2A, or 3.
3. Subjects where DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available.
4. Subjects with a VWF:RCo &lt;20% at Screening (after a minimum of 5 days since last VWF treatment) or subjects who had a history of VWF:RCo &lt;10% documented in their medical notes at enrolment.

## Main Exclusion criteria

These  were  essentially  the  same  as  for  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  with  the  exception  that  in  study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 having Type 2B, 2N, or 2M VWD was an exclusion criterion.  However, for this study (CSLCT-BIO-08-52) a diagnosis of VWD Type 1, 2A, or 3 is defined as inclusion criterion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Duration of treatment, either on-demand or prophylaxis was to be 12 months. The frequency and dose of Voncento administration was  determined by the investigator. The schedule described in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was used to guide dosage.

## Objectives

Primary objectives:

- To assess the efficacy of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD.
- To investigate the PK profile of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD.

Secondary objective:

- To assess the safety of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoints:

-  Subjective  assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  its  usage  with  an  NSB  event,  surgical procedure, or use in a prophylaxis regimen.
- PK parameters for each VWF and FVIII were derived from plasma concentration values after an initial single dose of Voncento on Day 1. Parameters were also determined 6 months after the initial dose in Type 3 VWD subjects (repeat PK, recovery study).

· Assessment of response was to include the above assessments as well as haemostasis during surgical procedure, blood loss, and transfusion requirements.

Secondary endpoints listed by severity and relationship to Voncento:

- The nature and incidence of AEs
- The development of FVIII and / or VWF inhibitors.

## Haemostasis assessment

Please refer to study CSLCT-BIO-08-54.

## Sample size

The number of patients was based on the CHMP guideline CPMP/BPWG/220/02 which requires at least 12 subjects with VWD to take part in the PK study, this number should ensure a minimum of 8 evaluable subjects fulfilling the following conditions:

- At least 3 patients with Type 3 VWD and at least 6 subjects aged between 0 and 6 years.
- At study start, only children of ≥6 years of age were to be included; younger children were included after at least 3 subjects of ≥6 years had been enrolled.
- At least 5 investigational sites were to be involved.

## Recruitment

The first subject enrolled on 29 Jul 2010 and the last subject completed on 27 Aug 2013.

## Conduct of the study

There were 1 non-substantial and 2 substantial amendments issued after the study protocol had been finalised on 10 December 2009 and these are not considered to have affected the validity of the data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

The mean age of the 17 patients was 5.2 years with 9 (52.9%) aged &lt;6 years. All but 2 were Caucasian. Demographics were similar between treatment arms with the exception that all 4 patients in prophylaxis Arm 1 were male and a higher proportion of Arm 1 patients (75%) were &lt;6 years old (Table 12).

Overall, 7 patients (41.2%) had Type 2A VWD and the remaining 10 patients had Type 3 VWD, 3 in Arm1 and 7 in Arm 2) (Table 13). One patient was excluded from the efficacy population because he did not experience a NSB.

## Numbers analysed

Efficacy results were based on the efficacy population (treated subjects who had at least 1 NSB event after baseline with an available haemostatic efficacy assessment) that included 16 subjects: 4 subjects in Arm 1 (prophylaxis) and 12 subjects in Arm 2 (on-demand). One subject in Arm 2 was excluded from the efficacy population because he did not experience any NSB events during the study.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Prophylaxis Regimen

## Study Drug Dosage

In Arm 1 (prophylaxis), subjects received a median number of 137.5 infusions at a median average human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex dose of 62.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Arm 1, a median of 119 IMP infusions (range: 45-161) were administered as prophylaxis, and a median of 17 (8-41) to treat a bleeding event.

The majority of bleeding events required 1 infusion (71 [78.0%]) of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and 18 events [19.8%] required none.

There was a large total number of infusions in Arm 1, including infusions given for prophylaxis and for the treatment of bleeding events. The MAH has confirmed that the mean and median prophylactic doses used in these children were approximately 60 IU/kg and that the frequency of administration ranged from 1 to 3 times a week. (See Table 14 below)

This median average dose of approximately 60 IU/kg is much higher than the dosage guidance of 25 to 40 IU/kg originally proposed to be recommended for routine prophylaxis for all ages in the SmPC. The PK analysis in the response of the MAH to the RfSI, confirms that VWF incremental recovery and exposure in the VWD paediatric population &lt;12 years is lower than in VWD patients &gt;12 years, supporting the higher dose used in this population as compared to the &gt; 12 years population.

## Number of bleeding events

The 4 subjects on prophylaxis experienced a total of 91 NSB, with a median per subject of 23.5 NSB events (Table 15). The majority of these events were spontaneous (79.1%), minor (96.7%), mucosal (87.9%). There were 3 major NSB events, of which 1 was a major mucosal bleed and there were no surgeries. Eighteen NSB events (19.8%) did not require treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and were therefore not assessed for haemostatic efficacy.

Three of these 4 subjects were already on a prophylaxis regimen at study entry and had reported very frequent minor or some major bleeding events in their medical history that justified the decision to continue with the prophylaxis regimen during this study.

The number of bleeding events reported during prophylaxis in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 is actually higher, with a mean and median of approximately 23 bleeds in 12 months, compared to the mean and median of 14 bleeds in the 12 months prior to study entry (Note: In the response to the RfSI the MAH has clarified that one of these subjects (071105) had been receiving on-demand treatment and not prophylaxis in the 12 months prior to study entry and had experienced 2 bleeds in that time.)

In the prophylaxis arm, there were 3 major bleeds  and 3 joint bleeds in the 4 subjects whereas in the on-demand treatment arm (Arm 2),  the 12 subjects experienced 26 major bleeding events (median per subject  2.0 major bleeds [range 0 to 9]) and 11 joint bleeds (median per subject 4.0 [range 0 to 9]).

Compared to the 12 months on a prophylactic regimen prior to entry to study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the number of bleeding events per individual during the 12 months on Voncento was rather similar in 2 of the 3 subjects concerned (from 28 to 34 and from 19 to 14). It was higher in one subject (from 9 to 35) than in the 12 months prior to study entry.

## Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis: investigator's and subject's assessment

The haemostatic efficacy for the 73 bleeding events was assessed by the investigator as excellent for 59 events (80.8%) and as good for the remaining 14 events (19.2%) (Table 14). This was also the case for the different types, locations and severities of bleeds, with the exception of the 3 major NSB events, where 1 event (the only major mucosal event)  was assessed as excellent and the other 2 (66.7%) as good.

The haemostatic efficacy for each 3-month interval was assessed by the investigator as either excellent (≥50.0% of subjects) or good.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects  rated  the  haemostatic  efficacy  as  excellent  for  the  majority  of  months  during  which  a  bleed occurred and for the majority of bleeding days and as good for the rest.

Overall  clinically  adequate  haemostatic  efficacy  has  been  shown  in  the  treatment  of  breakthrough  or traumatic  bleeds  occurring  during  prophylaxis  and  it  is  noted  that  for  major  bleeds  and  joint  bleeds, haemostatic efficacy was rated as good in most cases and rated as excellent in only 1 bleed.

NSB = non-surgical bleeding; N = number of subjects.

a Percentages  were  based  on  the  number  of  bleeding  events  of  the  considered  type  with  available  investigator's assessment.  Bleeding  events  with  missing  investigator's  assessment  for  efficacy  or  for  which  no  human  coagulation FVIII/VWF complex treatment was needed were not considered for this table.

The haemostatic efficacy per individual was also provided.

For  2  of  the  subjects  on  prophylaxis  during  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52,  no  treatment  was  required  for approximately one third of their minor bleeds and for one subject 9% of the minor bleeds did not need treatment. Overall, a higher percentage of bleeds did not require treatment with Voncento in patients on prophylaxis compared to patients receiving only on-demand trteatment where is was 16.7% of bleeds (see below).  The one subject who needed additional treatment for all minor bleeds during prophylaxis was receiving a prophylactic dose of 46 IU/kg VWF:RCo twice weekly, but had only experienced 8 minor bleeds.

## Study Drug Dosage

In  Arm  2,  subjects  received  overall  a  median  number  of  8.0  infusions  at  a  median  average  human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex dose of 50.9 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion. (The assessor concludes that his median dose apparently includes the dose given for PK assessment (n=13).) In the response to the RfSI, the MAH has clarified the doses given only for the treatment of bleeds.

The mean (± s.d.) number of bleeds in the 12 subjects in Arm 2 of paediatric Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in patients &lt;12 years was 8.0 (±6.4) and the median was 5.5 (range 1 to 22) (Table 15).

The per patient mean dose actually used for the treatment of bleeding in the on-demand arm (n=12) of paediatric  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  in  patients  &lt;12  years  ranged  from  approximately  35  to  70  IU/kg VWF:RiCo and the per patient median dose ranged from approximately 30 to 80 IU/kg VWF:RiCo.  Over all the 12 subjects, the average dose (± s.d.) was 47.6 (± 16.8) IU/kg VWF:RiCo and the median dose was 40.8 (range 30.2 to 88.6) IU/kg VWF:RiCo (See Table 19 below).

These doses are within the range of 40 to 80 IU/kg currently recommended in the Voncento SmPC for the treatment of bleeding and which the MAH also proposes for the paediatric population.

In Arm 2, the majority of bleeding events were treated with only 1 infusion (55 [57.3%]) and 16 events [16.7%] were not treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF. 25 NSB events (26.0%) required &gt;1 infusion.

## Haemostatic efficacy in on-demand treatment: investigator's and subject's assessment

Haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator for all the 80 events as excellent for 36 events (45.0%) and as good for the remaining 44 events (55.0%) (Table 16). This was also the case for the different types, locations and severities of bleeds with the exception of the 11 joint bleeding events, where the haemostatic efficacy of a relatively higher proportion of events was assessed as good (81.8%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For each 3-month interval, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as either excellent or good.

The haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the subject as excellent for 33 bleeding days (60.0%), as good for 12 bleeding days (21.8%), and as moderate for the remaining 10 bleeding days (18.2%) . There were 13 major mucosal bleeds in 5 subjects. The overall haemostatic efficacy for these 13 events was assessed by the investigator as excellent for 9 cases and as good for 4 cases. The subjects rated the haemostatic efficacy as excellent for the same 9 events and as good for the remaining 2 events, for which a subject assessment is available.

NSB = non-surgical bleeding; N = number of subjects.

a Percentages  were  based  on  the  number  of  bleeding  events  of  the  considered  type  with  available  investigator's assessment.  Bleeding  events  with  missing  investigator's  assessment  for  efficacy  were  not  considered  for  this  table. Bleeding events for which no human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex treatment was needed were not considered for this table.

## Ancillary analyses

## Examination of subgroups

## Age group (&lt;6 years versus ≥6 years)

The efficacy population included 8 subjects each in the subgroup of &lt;6-year-old subjects (3 in Arm 1 and 5 in Arm 2)  and that of ≥6-year-old subjects ( 1 in Arm 1 and 7 in Arm 2).

As in the overall efficacy population, in both age subgroups, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as either excellent or good for each 3-month interval and for each NSB event treated with Voncento (Table 21).

N = number of subjects; NSB = non-surgical bleeding.

Note: Percentages were based on the number of bleeding events of the considered type with available investigator's assessment. Bleeding events with missing investigator's assessment for efficacy were not considered for this table. Bleeding events for which no Voncento treatment was needed were not considered for this table.

Source: Table 14.2.3.1

In  Arm  1,  the  distribution  of  efficacy  ratings  of  excellent  and  good  across  bleeding  event  categories (spontaneous, trauma, post-surgery, major, minor, joint, mucosal, muscle and other) was similar between age subgroups (Table 24) and also compared to the overall efficacy population (Table 17 and Table 21, respectively).

In Arm 2, the distribution of efficacy ratings of excellent and good across bleeding event categories was also similar between age subgroups with the exception of traumatic bleeds (80% excellent haemostatic efficacy rating in children &lt; 6 years compared to 46.2% in children aged ≥ 6 years) and major bleeds (80% excellent haemostatic efficacy rating in children &lt; 6 years compared to 31.3 % in children aged ≥ 6 years).

For major and traumatic bleeds, there seems to be higher haemostatic efficacy in children &lt; 6 years than in children  ≥  6  years  but  considering  the  small  populations  and  potential    inter-individual  variation  in pharmacokinetics no great significance can de attached to this observation.

## VWD type (Type 2A versus Type 3)

The efficacy population included 7 subjects with VWD Type 2A (1 in Arm 1 and 6 in Arm 2) and 9 subjects with VWD Type 3 (3 in Arm 1 and 6 in Arm 2).

As in the overall efficacy population, in both VWD type  subgroups, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as either excellent or good for each 3-month interval and for each NSB event treated with Voncento (Table 22).

Also, for both VWD Type 2A and Type 3, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the subject as either excellent or good for each study month.

In subjects with Type 2A VWD, all except 2 bleeds that occurred in the single subject on prophylaxis in Arm 1 were minor mucosal bleeds (see table).  In the 6 subjects with Type 2A VWD receiving on-demand treatment in Arm 2, the majority of bleeds were also minor mucosal bleeds (30/38 events) but it is of note that  8/38 events were major mucosal bleeds.

In Arm 2, Type 3 subjects in contrast to with Type 2A, had a higher frequency of traumatic bleeds (15/42, 36% vs 3/38, 8%), of major bleeds (18/42, 43% vs 8/38,21%) and of  joint bleeds (10/42, 24% vs 1/38, 3%) with correspondingly less mucosal bleeds. This pattern of type of bleeds matches that expected from current knowledge of VWD sub-types.

Importantly, efficacy was rated as excellent for 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds, which are often difficult to treat, in subjects with Type 2A VWD.

Main Inclusion criteria were: -Male and female subjects ≥12 years of age, -Severe VWD where VWF:RCo was <15% at screening (after a minimum of 5 days since last VWF treatment) or the subject had a history of VWF:RCo <10% documented in their medical notes at enrolment. -DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available. -Patients requiring a VWF product for prophylactic therapy or to control an NSB event. Altogether, the study consisted of 3 periods: 1. Screening period of up to 28 days. 2. PK component of up to 183 days (PK subjects), which consisted of: A single dose of Voncento on Day 1 A repeat single dose of Voncento on Day 180, at least 6 months after the initial infusion (repeat PK for Type 3 VWD PK subjects only). PK samples were collected on Days 1, 2, 3, and 4, and on Days 180, 181, 182, and 183. All PK subjects were to enter the efficacy component of the study at the completion of the initial PK period. 3. Efficacy component with 3 arms of up to 12 or 24 months; depending on the treatment arm subjects participated in. | This is a Phase II/III, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled study to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of Voncento in subjects with severe VWD.

| Primary Analysis   | On-demand Arm 2 Investigator's assessment of haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event There was a haemostatic efficacy assessment in all 80 events as follows: Excellent in 36/80 (45.0%); Good in 44/80 (55.0%). Subject's assessment of haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event, all days Excellent for 33/55 bleeding days (60.0%), good for 12/55 bleeding days (21.8%), and moderate for the remaining 10 bleeding days. Number of Bleeding Events During the Study: Total number and number per subject The 12 subjects of Arm 2 (on-demand) experienced a total of 96 NSB events. The majority were spontaneous (77.1%), minor (72.9%), mucosal (82.3%), and were treated at home (53.1%). A total of 26 events (27.1%) were considered major, including 13 major mucosal NSB events. Sixteen NSB events (16.7%) did not require treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex; these events were therefore considered not evaluable and consequently not assessed for haemostatic efficacy.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Prospective studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (adults and adolescents), CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (paediatrics below 12 years of age), and CSLCT-BIO-03-97 (adults and children) provide efficacy data on the treatment of VWD with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex both as prophylaxis and on demand therapy:

## Prophylaxis therapy:

9 subjects (Arms 1 and 3) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54;

4 subjects (Arm 1) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52;

4 subjects in CSLCT-BIO-03-97.

## On-demand therapy:

20 subjects (Arm 2) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54;

12 subjects (Arm  2) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52;

19 subjects in CSLCT-BIO-03-97.

Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 mainly provides efficacy data on the treatment for surgical events and supportive data from 4 subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment.

The  investigator-led  studies  provide  supportive  information  on  the  treatment  of  VWD  with  human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as on-demand therapy. The Shortt study contributes supportive data on surgical events in adults and the Howman study supportive data on NSB and surgical events in paediatric patients.

## Prophylaxis Regimen

The data from study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLCT-BIO-08-54 provide a comparison between prophylaxis in children &lt; 12 years old and adults. There are no data on prophylaxis in the paediatric population aged ≥12 years to 18 years.

## Number of Non-surgical Bleeding Events

There were  considerably more  bleeding events during prophylaxis reported in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (91 events in 4 subjects; median 23.5, range 9 to 35 ) than in the adults on prophylaxis in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (10 events in 8 subjects in Arm 3; median 1.0, range 1 to 6). The single subject in Arm 1 reported 10 bleeds over 12 months (Table 21).

In the prophylaxis arm of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, there were 3 major bleeds in the 4 subjects (one major bleed in each of 3 subjects) and 3 joint bleeds in the 4 subjects.

For comparison, in prophylaxis Arm 3 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, there were altogether 3 major bleeds experienced by 2 of the 8 subjects and 2 joint bleeds in one subject.

The MAH suggests that the higher number of bleeds per patient in children &lt;12 years old may be due to the generally high variability in bleeding tendency among VWD patients (e.g., some patients are more prone to oral mucosal bleedings than others), but also due to the higher activity in children, which may result in more injuries,  compared  with  adults;  20.9%  of  bleeding  events  in  Arm  1  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  were trauma-induced compared with none in the Arm 3 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54.

## Haemostatic Efficacy in Non-surgical Bleeding Events occurring during prophylaxis

In study paediatric CSLCT-BIO-08-52, 73 of the 91 events and in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, all 10 bleeds were treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In both studies, the haemostatic efficacy of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex per bleeding event was assessed  as  either  excellent  (90.9%  of  bleeds  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  and  80.8%  in  study CSLCT-BIO-08-52) or good. (Table 21). Haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeds occurring during prophylaxis was thus globally equivalent in the paediatric and adult subjects,

In supportive study CSLCT-BIO-03-97, the 3 adult subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment reported overall a higher number of bleeds (22) than those in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54: 1 subject each with 1, 3, and 17 bleeding events, respectively, over a period of 12 months, and the 4th subject was a 3 year old with 1 minor bleeding event over a period of 6 months. The investigator made a retrospective assessment of haemostatic efficacy  in  these  patients  at  the  three  monthly  follow-up  visits  and  efficacy  was  on  all  occasions  was considered to be good or excellent.

## On-demand regimen

## Haemostatic Efficacy during the on-demand regimen

Overall, the majority of events in the pivotal studies were assessed with either excellent or good haemostatic efficacy: 98.3% in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, 100% in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. This was also the case in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 where there were only 4 bleeds in 6 subjects. In the Howman study in 43 paediatric subjects aged 5 months to 17.5 years there were 72 bleeds, with an assessment of excellent in approximately 80% good in approximately 18% and moderate in the rest.

## Clinical studies in special populations

In the prophylaxis arms (Arm 3 and Arm 1) of Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, all 8 patients were older than 18 years of age, mean 43.0 (s.d, 15.9) years, median 42.5 (range 21 to 68 years).

Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 was specifically performed in children &lt; 12 years old.

There were no further studies or data in special populations relevant to this procedure.

## Supportive studies

Supportive data relevant to this procedure was available from studies CSLCT-BIO-03-97 and the Howman study - Howman et al (2011). The Shortt study (2007) was an investigator led study which retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of Voncento in VWD patients undergoing invasive procedures or surgery.

## CSLCT-BIO-03-97

All but one of the 23 subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 were adults and the study provided principally efficacy and safety data on the use of Voncento in surgery with some data on non-surgical bleeding events and data on routine prophylaxis in 4 subjects.

The dosage guideline for prophylaxis was 20 - 50 IU/kg 2 to 3 times per week. All four prophylactic patients had at least one episode of spontaneous bleeding such as epistaxis or bleeding into joints (elbow, shoulder and ankle). Patient 06-A353 was known to play contact sport during the study and had 17 single episodes of bleeding either due to trauma (four events) or spontaneous bleeding.  The four patients' diary cards were reviewed every 3 months, and at each of these follow-up visits the investigator made a retrospective

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy.  On  all  occasions,  haemostatic  efficacy  was  considered  by  the investigator to be Good or Excellent.

The three adult patients received prophylaxis for 12 months.

The 3-year-old boy (Subject 10A354) included in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 was the only paediatric subject in the study and he was on prophylaxis treatment, which he received for &gt;5 months. He experienced 1 minor bleeding event at the left ankle that did not require any corrective therapy.

## Howman study

The investigator-led study reported by Howman et al (2011) retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in children and adolescents with VWD treated for surgery, NSB events, or continuous prophylaxis from April 2003 to February 2008.

The study included 25 males and 18 females paediatric patients with a median age of 10 years amd a range of 5 months to 17.5 years. Type 1 VWD was diagnosed in 21 subjects, while 4 subjects had Type 2A VWD, 6 had Type 2B VWD, 4 had Type 2M VWD, 1 had Type 2N VWD, and 7 subjects had Type 3 VWD.

The mean daily dose was 51 IU FVIII/kg (range: 13-151 IU FVIII/kg) for major surgery with a median treatment duration of 7 days (range: 1-24 days) and 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 14-76 IU FVIII/kg) for minor surgery with a median treatment duration of 3 days (range: 1-8 days). For NSB events, the mean daily dose was 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 16-192 IU FVIII/kg) with a median treatment duration of 1 day (range: 1-13 days).

Forty-two surgical events were treated: 10 major events in 10 subjects and 32 minor surgical events in 21 subjects.  Four  episodes  of  post-surgical  bleeding  events  were  also  treated  in  4  subjects,  who  had  not received human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex to prevent bleeding during the procedure. A total of 72 NSB events were treated: 46 mucocutaneous in 11 subjects and 26 musculoskeletal or soft tissue bleedings in 13 subjects. Only tranexamic acid was used as an adjunctive therapy in these subjects.

The haemostatic efficacy for all surgical events was excellent or good in approximately 90% of events (90% major and 91% of minor surgical events). Haemostatic efficacy for all NSB events was rated as excellent or good in 94% of events, and within Type 3 VWD subjects in 98% of NSB events.

The blood loss during surgical events was assessed by the surgeon for 15 minor and 5 major surgical events and in all cases was considered to be less than or equivalent to that normally expected in subjects without a bleeding disorder.

Two subjects with Type 3 VWD received long term prophylaxis with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex to prevent bleeding. One subject had started prophylaxis therapy at 9 months of age which was successful at preventing recurrent epistaxis. However, a second subject suffered ongoing ankle joint bleeding, and was reported as having a low responding inhibitor, after 4 years of prophylaxis.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The general design, endpoints and sample size of both studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (Routine prophylaxis in subjects ≥ 12 years old) and CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (efficacy and safety in paediatric patients &lt; 12 years old) are in line with the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All patients who received routine prophylaxis in Arm 3 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 were &gt; 18 years old, thus the study did not contribute data on routine prophylaxis in adolescents. Notably, 6 of the 8 subjects in Arm 3 had Type 3 VWD, a severe disease type with negligible levels of VWF thus comprising patients most likely to need or to benefit from routine prophylaxis.

In study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, 10 of the 17 subjects had Type 3 VWD, which can be considered a relatively large number of children to include with this rare disease.

The dosage ranges proposed in the schedule to be followed during both studies are somewhat lower than that of 40 to 80 IU/kg vWF:RCo and 20 to 40 IU/kg FVIII:C recommended in the Guideline on the Core SmPC for Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor, for achieving haemostasis.

The target FVIII/vWF levels are close to that recommended (&gt; 60% vWF:RiCo and &gt; 40% FVIII:C) in the Core SmPC which proposes only a very global target level, and not specified for example for haemostasis in bleeds or in major or minor surgery. However, the Core SmPC gives no dosage recommendation for routine prophylaxis and no specific dosage recommendations for the paediatric population but states that where indicated in children information should be provided on whether dose and frequency of administration differs to that in adults.

Overall, the dosage guideline used in both studies can be considered acceptable for the purposes of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 but in view of the doses used in the paediatric study of Howman et al (2010), it might be considered to be somewhat low for paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Efficacy in preventing bleeds during routine Prophylaxis

## Patients ≥12 years

Routine prophylaxis in adult subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was clearly shown to be efficacious in preventing spontaneous bleeding events as the mean (2.0, s.d 2.2) and median (1.0, range 1 to 6) number of bleeding events over 12 months was much lower in the 8 subjects who continued on to receive routine prophylaxis in Arm 3 compared to the mean of 26.7 (SD 24.2) and median of 19.5, range 2 to 82 in the 20 subjects on on-demand treatment in Arm 2.

Importantly, during prophylaxis, there were 3 major bleeds in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint bleeds. In comparison, in the same 8 subjects during on-demand treatment, 5 subjects experienced a median of 7.0 major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median of 34 joint bleeds (range 7 to 58).

Furthermore, efficacy in the treatment of all the 10 reported bleeds in subjects on prophylaxis was reported as excellent. Thus routine prophylaxis was successful in these subjects.

No data on routine prophylaxis was obtained in adolescents, which is not considered to be of concern.

## Paediatric patients &lt;12 years

In the 4 paediatric patients (age &lt; 12 years) on routine prophylaxis, the efficacy of the prophylaxis in preventing bleeds was apparently less than in the 12 months prior to study entry. As suggested by the MAH in the CSR of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, this difference in the number of bleeds might be attributable to underreporting during the prior non-study period of 12 months compared to the stringent reporting during the study period because of the use of a diary and intensive follow-up by the investigator.

The median number of major bleeds per subject in the prophylaxis arm was half that in the on-demand arm and the median number of joint bleeds was similar. However it is difficult to draw conclusions with such small numbers and the populations in the 2 arms were not similar. In prophylaxis Arm 1, three of the 4 subjects had the most severe type of VWD, Type 3 and one subject had Type 2A whereas in on-demand Arm 2, approximately half of the subjects had Type 3 VWD (7/13) and the other 6 had Type 2A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number of bleeds per subject was higher in the on-demand arm compared to the prophylaxis arm. However the number of subjects was much smaller in the prophylaxis arm and there was no comparison between on-demand treatment and prophylaxis in the same subjects, which hampers interpretation of the numbers of bleeds. It is of some significance that approximately 97% of all bleeds in the prophylaxis arm were rated as minor compared to 73% in the on-demand arm.

It is also of note that for 2 of the subjects on prophylaxis during study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, no treatment was required for approximately one third of their minor bleeds and for one subject 9% of the minor bleeds did not need  treatment.  Overall,  a  higher  percentage  of  bleeds  did  not  require  treatment  within  patients  on prophylaxis compared to patients receiving only on-demand treatment (16.7% of bleeds).

## Efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events

The paediatric data in children &lt; 12 years from study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 show a high level of haemostatic efficacy (efficacy reported as excellent in approximately 80% of bleeds) in the treatment of spontaneous and traumatic bleeding events in the 4 subjects on prophylaxis. However, the level of haemostatic efficacy reported  was  lower  in  the  12  subjects  receiving  only  on-demand  treatment  with  efficacy  reported  as excellent in only 45% of bleeds.

Although a clinically relevant degree of haemostatic efficacy was reached in the on-demand treatment of bleeds in the paediatric subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, overall it was at a lower level than in the adult and  adolescent  subjects  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54.  Haemostatic  efficacy  was  rated  as  excellent  in approximately half of the bleeds and good in the rest compared to 90% excellent in the adult and adolescent subjects.

It is reassuring that efficacy was rated as excellent for the majority (9 of 13) of the major mucosal bleeds during on-demand treatment in the paediatric patients as these are known to be difficult to treat. On the other hand, in the case of joint bleeds haemostatic efficacy was rated as good for 9 of 11 bleeds and for 2 bleeds it was rated as excellent.

## Dosing

## Prophylactic dose in patients ≥12 years

In study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, the mean (±s.d.) average dose per infusion given for prophylaxis was 28.8 (± 4.1) and the median average dose was 28.1 (range 25 to 35) IU VWF:RCo/kg, according to protocol  to be given one to 3 times weekly. These doses were effective in reducing the number of bleeds and in reducing the number of major bleeds in the 8 subjects who first were treated on-demand in Arm2 and then received a prophylactic regimen in Arm 3. The median number of infusions per month in Arm 3 varied between 4.0 and 7.0. These doses and dose frequencies are considered to support the prophylactic regimen of 25 - 40 IU/kg VWF:RCo/kg 1 to 3 times per week recommended by the MAH in patients ≥12 years. This is included in the SmPC section 4.2.

## Dosing in paediatric patients &lt;12 years

## Dose for the treatment of bleeds

According to the protocol of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the initial dose for the treatment of bleeds was to be  25 - 50 IU/kg VWF:RiCo with the aim of reaching a target VWF peak level of &gt;50% (FVIII level &gt;30%). It seems possible that this dosage range recommended in the protocol may not have been optimal for all patients &lt;12 years.

In the on-demand arm (n=12) of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in patients &lt;12 years, the mean of the doses per patient actually used for the treatment of bleeding ranged from approximately 35 to 70 IU/kg VWF:RCo and the median of the doses per patient ranged from approximately 30 to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo.  Over all the 12 subjects, the average dose (± s.d.) was 47.6 (± 16.8) IU/kg VWF:RCo and the median dose was 40.8 (range 30.2 to 88.6) IU/kg VWF:RCo (Table 8 of the Applicant's response to this question).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For comparison, in pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 in patients aged ≥12 years, the 20 subjects in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) received a mean (± s.d.) average dose per infusion of 37.8 (± 8.7) IU/kg VWF:RCo and the median average dose per infusion was 36.1 IU/kg (range: 29 to 64) IU/kg VWF:RCo (Table 19 of this report: Summary of efficacy for Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54).

Thus for children &lt;12 years the mean and median doses per infusion used for the treatment of bleeds were higher than in patients ≥12 years. The doses used by children &lt;12 years fell within the proposed on-demand dosing range of 40 - 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo but reached a higher level within this range than the doses used in patients ≥12 years. (See also discussion on Clinical pharmacology).

Therefore the dosing regimen for the treatment of bleeding in the Paediatric VWD population was agreed as: 'Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. ' in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

## Prophylactic dose in patients &lt; 12 years

Further analysis in the MAH response to the RfSI reveals that in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the median average dose per infusion during the period on prophylaxis was 62.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg. There was a large total number of infusions in Arm 1, including infusions given for prophylaxis and for the treatment of bleeding events. The MAH has confirmed that the mean and median prophylactic doses used in these children were approximately 60 IU/kg and that the frequency of administration ranged from 1 to 3 times a week.

At a single patient level, in the 3 subjects who had been on a prophylactic regimen prior to entry to study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the number of bleeding events per individual during the 12 months on  was rather similar in 2 subjects (from 28 to 34 in subject 110101 and from 19 to 14 in subject 110102) and higher in one subject (from 9 to 35 in subject 110103) than in the 12 months prior to study entry.

The prophylactic doses used per individual were similar in the subjects on prophylaxis before and during the study and were also used by these patients in the continuation Study CSLCT-BIO-06-94. As discussed in the clinical pharmacology section, the dosing recommendation in section 4.2 of the SmPC for prophylaxis for patients aged &lt;12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 years of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 - 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2).

The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The data from Study CSLCT-Bio-08-54 support an indication in routine prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous and traumatic bleeding events in the adult population with a recommended prophylactic dose of 25 - 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo 1 to 3 times per week.

The data from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 support use in paediatric patients &lt;12 years old. For the treatment of bleeds, it is agreed that the dose range of 40 - 80 IU/kg VWF:RiCo, the same as for patients ≥12 years, can be considered appropriate. Efficacy in routine prophylaxis has also been shown in 4 patients &lt;12 years old with severe VWD.

The protocol of the Post-Marketing Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, which was agreed as part of the post authorisation measures in the initial approval of Voncento, was amended to incorporate the dose range 40-80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight for prophylaxis treatment in children.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The  safety  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  has  been  established  in  clinical  studies  for  the treatment of both haemophilia A and VWD, and is supported by post-marketing surveillance data.

Key issues with regard to safety of FVIII concentrates are inhibitor development, the potential for viral contamination,  and  in  patients  with  VWD  the  risk  of  VTE  due  to  elevated  FVIII  levels.  As  with  any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible and symptoms indicative of such  reactions  are  an  identified  risk  for  Human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex.  Whereas  inhibitor development is no less a concern than in previous decades, the problems of virus contamination in plasma derived products have been largely resolved  with successive improvements in the manufacturing process required by regulatory guidelines. Episodes of venous VTE have been reported in the literature in subjects with VWD receiving VWF/FVIII replacement therapy, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis (Mannucci PM et al, 2002; Makris M et al, 2002).

Nevertheless, the number of such events in the literature has remained very low.

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure.

**The retrospective Howman study (Haemophilia 2011) included 43 paediatric patients aged 0.4 to 17 years but apart from 2 paediatric subjects on routine prophylaxis, results were for the most part not reported according to age subgroups.

## Adults

## Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54:

All subjects completed at least 12 months of treatment.

On-demand treatment: Subjects in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) had a median number of 20.0 infusions (range: 3-92) over 12 months at a median IMP dose of 36.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 29 64 IU/kg).

Prophylaxis treatment: All subjects received prophylaxis therapy for 12 months with a median number of 72.5 infusions (range: 16-118), with the exception of the single subject in Arm 1 who received 197 infusions over 15 months and 1 subject in Arm 3 who withdrew consent after about 10.5 months of prophylaxis treatment.

## Paediatric patients

Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (patients below 12 years of age)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 17 paediatric subjects completed the 12 month treatment period of the study.

Prophylaxis treatment : The 4 subjects of the prophylaxis treatment arm (Arm 1) of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, received a median number of 137.5 infusions. In Arm 1, a median number of 119 infusions (range: 45-161) were administered as prophylaxis, and a median of 17 (8-41) to treat a bleeding event.

On-demand treatment :  The  13  subjects  in  the on-demand arm (Arm 2), had a median number of 8.0 infusions  (range  1-53)  at  a  median  dose  of  50.9  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  per  infusion  (range:  35.4-115.1  IU VWF:RCo/kg).

The 3-year-old boy in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 received 66 infusions of 500 IU FVIII each (about 29 IU FVIII/kg  body  weight (Assessor:  corresponding  approximately  to  60  IU  VWF:RCo/kg)) as  prophylaxis treatment.

## Supportive retrospective investigator-led studies in VWD

Shortt study (2007, principally surgery and 1 child on prophylaxis): The average daily dose of human coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  was  29  IU  FVIII/kg  (range:  9-65  IU  FVIII/kg).  The  mean  duration  of treatment for each event was 4 days (range 1-13 days).

Howman study paediatric study (principally surgery and 2 subjects on prophylaxis): The median duration of treatment for major surgeries was 7 days (range: 1-24 days) at a mean daily dose of 51 IU FVIII/kg (range: 13-151 IU FVIII/kg). Minor surgeries were treated for a median duration of 3 days (range: 1-8 days) at a mean dose of 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 14 76 IU FVIII/kg). For NSB events, the median duration was 1 day (range: 1 13 days) and the mean dose 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 16-192 IU FVIII/kg).

## Long term exposure

With regard to long term exposure, in the prospective clinical studies, it seems that 39 VWD patients ≥12 years ( Assessor's calculation) , and 13 paediatric patients under 12 years have been exposed to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex for up to 12 months, intermittently at varying frequencies for the treatment of non-surgical and surgical bleeding events.

Eight adults who continued from on-demand treatment in Arm 2 of study CSTCT-BIO-08-54 on to routine prophylaxis in Arm 3 of that study receiving doses 1 to 3 times weekly and reached an exposure of (in one case almost) 24 months.

Overall the exposure in 10 adults (studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLT-BIO-03-97) and 5 subjects &lt; 12 years (studies CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLT-BIO-03-97) during long term routine prophylaxis is considered adequate to assess the safety of the treatment regimen which only a subset of subjects with severe VWD are likely to need.

Also, the exposure overall in 18 paediatric subjects &lt; 12 years is considered adequate for assessing the safety and it can be taken into consideration that a post-marketing study will follow.

## Adverse events

## Adults and paediatric patients

A  total  of  508  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs,  ie,  with  onset  after  first  dose  of  study medication) were reported during the clinical studies, 210 in haemophilia A studies (143 in pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-07-47, 2 and 65 in supportive studies CSLCT-BIO-95-30 and CSLCT-BIO-95-41, respectively) and 298 in VWD studies (86 and 77 in pivotal studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLCT-BIO-08-52, respectively, and 24 and 111 in supportive studies CSLCT-BIO-00-75 and CSLCT-BIO-03-97, respectively). An overview of the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 TEAE during the prospective clinical studies is provided by AE type and study in Table 29.

## Serious adverse events

## Adults and paediatric patients

A total of 9 subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during the clinical studies, 5 subjects with haemophilia A and 4 subjects with VWD.

None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex or to study procedures which can be agreed based on the data submitted.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No deaths occurred during or shortly after any of the clinical studies in either the haemophilia A or VWD subject populations.

## Significant adverse events

- No positive FVIII or VWF inhibitor titres occurred during any of the prospective clinical studies. Please see 'Immunological Events' below.
- No VTE (venous thromboembolism) events were reported in any of the studies.
- No indication of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions was seen in clinical studies.
- During the studies that provided safety data, no cases of suspected transmission of hepatitis virus or parvovirus B19 occurred.

The  population  studied  is  very  small  with  regard  to  the  likelihood  of  detecting  uncommon  events. Nevertheless it can be concluded that the adverse event profile is very benign.

No safety concern specific to the paediatric population has been identified.

## Overdose

It is noted that 3 subjects in the PK part of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 received doses which were a factor 2 too high. This also occurred in one case in pivotal VWD study CSLCT BIO 08 54 in adults and adolescents. These reports were not associated with any TEAEs.

These were apparently due to incorrect dosing because of confusion arising from the labelling both in units of FVIII and in units of VWF (the number of units of FVIII in the product is half that of VWF). The subjects were dosed according to the labelled FVIII:C content and not the VWF:RCo content.

This remains a point of concern and will be retained in the RMP.

## Laboratory findings

## Adults and paediatric patients

Overall, there were no consistent changes in mean haematology or clinical chemistry values across the studies, and no trends were observed in changes in individual haematology or clinical chemistry values. Also, no consistent statistically or clinically significant changes from pre-dose values were noted in vital signs in any of the clinical studies.

## Safety in special populations

No apparent differences between the safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in adolescents (n=8: 5 subjects with haemophilia A and 3 with VWD) and that in adults were seen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 assessed the safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in paediatric subjects  &lt;12  years  of  age.  Apart  from  a  slightly  different  AE  reporting  profile,  no  clinically  relevant differences were seen in safety findings between children and adults, which is supported by the available clinical experience in other studies (including the Howman study) and post-marketing information.

The safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in the geriatric population has not been systematically studied. However, subjects in the clinical trials have included individuals up to 85 years. Updated information on the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) experienced by elderly patients (≥ 65 years) is tabulated for clinical studies (CT) and post-marketing data (PM) has been supplied by the MAH in the response to the RfSI (Table 30).

In addition, in study CSLCT-BIO-10-67 (study terminated early) in haemophilia A (treatment for immune tolerance induction (ITI therapy)) 3 ADR were reported: hydrocephalus (Nervous system disorders, SAE), ischemic stroke (nervous system disorder, SAE), stenosis of the a carotis (Nervous system disorder, SAE).

The adverse events described in the single child in the terminated ITI study CSLCT-BIO-10-67 have been evaluated in a previous procedure (EMEA/H/C/002493/0000/P46). It was concluded that the patient had underlying pathology and that the B/R remained positive.

In patients aged 65 to 74 years, there were 13 ADRs of which three were serious, but no information is given on the nature of these adverse events.

## Immunological Events

## Inhibitors

No positive FVIII or VWF inhibitor titres occurred during any of the prospective clinical studies, with 1 exception:  a  positive  FVIII  inhibitor  finding  was  reported  for  1  subject  at  the  final  visit  in  study CSLCT-BIO-07-47; this case was also reported as an SAE (aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitors) that led to study discontinuation. In supportive VWD study CSLCT-BIO-03-97, concerns were raised about a suspected inhibitor in 1 subject who had very low (zero) levels of VWF:RCo for 2 NSB events although adequate doses of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex had been administered. However, VWF inhibitors were not measured in this study. In the retrospective investigator-led Howman study (Howman et al, 2011), 1 subject with Type 3 VWD was reported to have a low responding inhibitor that was noted after 4 years of prophylaxis treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

## Allergic/Anaphylactic Reactions

During the clinical studies that provided safety data, no indication for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions was seen.

No allergic/anaphylactic reactions were observed in clinical studies but it is noted that In Table 6 of the Summary of Clinical safety a single case of upper airway obstruction is listed which occurred in one patient. In the context of other reported TEAEs it was considered not to represent a hypersensitivity reaction. The MAH has provided a narrative of this case explaining that the reported event was nasal obstruction with no elements suggestive of lower airway obstruction and that the event does not appear to have been due to a hypersensitivity reaction.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interactions between human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and other medicinal products are known.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the studies supporting the current extension of indication of prophylaxis in VWD, and to include paediatric data in the SmPC, no discontinuations due to adverse events were reported.

Notably there were no discontinuations for any reason from the paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52.

## Post marketing experience

Voncento (human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex), is centrally authorised in the EU since 12 August 2013.

Post-marketing surveillance data collected by CSL  comprise AE information collected in the company's database  since  first  registration  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  (Australia,  August  2000). Post-marketing data were collected from a variety of sources including spontaneous reports (both consumer and health care professional), investigator-led studies (Shortt et al, 2007; Howman et al, 2011) and data from the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee database.

Since launch of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and up to February 2014, 701,467,500 IU were distributed globally, and based on calculation from a single standard dose this total amount of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was administered (globally) in 350,734 single dose exposures, resulting in a total exposure of 2,248 patient years.

Since  August  2000  up  to  12  February  2014,  111  spontaneous  ADRs  from  39  case  reports  for  human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were reported by spontaneous data sources. The most frequently reported preferred terms were drug ineffectiveness (12), malaise (7), dizziness (6), nausea (5), and ecchymosis (5). Of the 111 ADRs, 38 were serious. No changes to the reference safety information were deemed necessary from the evaluation of these events. The cumulative experience to date of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex is shown in Figure 3 below.

## Adverse Events of Interest for FVIII/VWF Products

## Viral transmission

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No viral infections were reported in the studies supporting this application.

## Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions

Cumulatively, to date, there have been 12 reports of hypersensitivity and 1 report of anaphylactic reaction following the administration of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

## Inhibitor formation

Two cases of inhibitor formation (one in a subject with VWD and one in a subject with haemophilia A) to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were reported to CSL in 10 years of post-marketing surveillance.

## Thromboembolic events

To date, there have been no post-marketing spontaneous reports of thromboembolic type events after treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Exposure

In the prospective pivotal clinical studies, close to 40 VWD patients ≥12 years and 13 patients &lt; 12 years have been exposed to Voncento for up to 12 months, intermittently at varying frequencies for the treatment of non-surgical and surgical bleeding events.

In  the  pivotal  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  eight  adults  received  an  additional  12 months treatment (in one case 10.5 months) on a routine prophylaxis regimen reaching an exposure of 24 months and 4 additional paediatric patients &lt;12years old were also treated for 12 months with a routine prophylaxis regimen. Altogether there were 9 subjects with Type 3 VWD of whom 6 were adults and 3 were children &lt;12 years old with 2 &lt;6 years old.

Although the numbers are not high, in view of the fact that only a subset of subjects with severe VWD are likely to need prophylaxis,  overall the exposure in 10 adults and 5 subjects &lt; 12 years in the prospective studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54, CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLT-BIO-03-97 during long term routine prophylaxis is considered adequate to assess the safety of the treatment regimen.

Also, the exposure overall in 18 paediatric subjects &lt; 12 years is considered sufficient to evaluate safety in that age group.

Three subjects aged from 12 to 18 years have been treated in the clinical studies but no subjects in this age range have been treated with a routine prophylaxis regimen. Given that there are data in children &lt; 12 years and subjects from 19 years upwards, this is not considered to be a serious deficit.

## Adverse Events

In  the  context  of  this  procedure  concerning  patients  with  VWD,  important  potential  risks  are  inhibitor development and the risk of VTE due to elevated FVIII levels. Also, as with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible particularly with repeated exposure. In plasma derived products there is also the potential for viral contamination.

During  the  studies  that  provided  safety  data,  no  cases  of  suspected  transmission  of  hepatitis  virus  or parvovirus B19 occurred. No VTE (venous thromboembolism) events were reported in any of the studies.

There has been only one report of development of inhibitor to VWD which concerned a Type 3 VWD in the retrospective  investigator  led  Howman  study.  The  patient  had  developed  a  low  responding  inhibiting antibody to VWF after 4 years on a prophylactic regimen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  reports  that  no  indication  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  causing  allergic  or anaphylactic reactions was seen in clinical studies. However, as no narrative can be found, the MAH is asked to clarify the conclusion that, in the context of other reported TEAEs, a case of upper airway obstruction was considered not to represent a hypersensitivity reaction.

The data in the clinical studies submitted on the treatment of VWD did not reveal a particular pattern of AEs and  the  AEs  reported  most  frequently  post-marketing  are  to  be  expected  due  to  the  intravenous administration, to the bleeding disorder being treated or were non-specific.

Overall the adverse events reported in patients of all ages were mild and none led to discontinuation. There were no deaths during the clinical studies. Serious adverse events were reported during the clinical studies in 4 patients with VWD and none were considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. The incidence and type of laboratory AEs do not raise concern and are not considered influencing the safety.

However,  the  numbers  of  patients  with  VWD  in  the  clinical  trials  are  small  with  regard  to  detecting uncommon adverse events and the safety profile in both VWD will be further evaluated in post-marketing study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and will be followed in the PSURs.

There are few data in patients older than 65 years with VWD with one patient in this age range in the pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 who also received routine prophylaxis. Lack of data in this age range is included as missing information in the RMP.

The possibility of incorrect dosing due to product labelling in units of FVIII and VWF remained a real issue in the VWD studies submitted and should continue to be covered in the RMP. In the packaging and product information the MAH emphasises the dual content and different amounts of FVIII and VWF in the product in order to reduce the chance of dosage errors.

The favourable AE profile of Voncento as known in the post-marketing history is acknowledged, although it is considered that underreporting cannot be excluded.

The AEs reported most frequently post-marketing e.g. administration site conditions, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, vascular disorders and nervous system disorders are to be expected due to the intravenous administration , to the bleeding disorder being treated or are non-specific.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusions on clinical safety

From the data submitted, no unexpected adverse events or pattern of adverse events has emerged and the AEs reported were generally mild and not serious. No new safety concerns have arisen and the safety profile is considered to remain positive.

In particular, no significant issues of safety or ADRs were identified during treatment of a limited number (18) of paediatric patients ranging in age from &lt;1 year to 11 years, including prophylaxis in 4 patients of whom 3 were &lt;6 years.

Overall no safety concerns have arisen during routine prophylaxis regimens given to patients with severe VWD for a period of 12 months. The additional cases of overdose reported from clinical trials were included in  section  4.9  but  no  adverse  reactions  have  been  associated  with  these  reports  (see  SmPC).  Risk  of incorrect dosing was included in the RMP (See also RMP).

## 2.5.2. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The next data lock point will be 18 August 2015.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.0 is acceptable. In addition, minor revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update.

The clinical data provided in support of the variation application (CSLCT-BIO-08-52, CSLCT-BIO-08-54) showed that the safety profile of Voncento in paediatric patients was comparable to the established safety profile of the product; no new or unexpected risks were identified. The important potential risk 'Off-label use including in ITI therapy and children under 12 years' was narrowed to 'Off-label use including in ITI therapy'.

The proposal to remove the safety concerns 'Mild forms of haemophillia A' and 'Patients with AIDS and other chronic illnesses' from the missing information was supported as no specific safety concerns have been identified and neither foreseen with regard to use of Voncento in these populations.

The safety concern 'Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy' classified as missing information should be followed as important potential risk. Data on ITI in haemophilia A patients using a VIII product with a high VWF content would be of interest as there are few data on ITI with such a product.

The proposal to remove the safety concern 'Exposure date in non-Caucasian ethnic groups' was approvable as the MAH is requested to provide within the next PSUR (DLP: 12 August 2015), a detailed review of the current available data on the differences in inhibitor development between ethnic populations, and discuss the need to update the product information. Also, the MAH is requested to discuss the need for a RMP update, on the basis of the results of the data review.

Removing of missing information 'Paediatric data (&lt; 12 years)' from the safety specification was approvable in view of the submitted data on use of Voncento in the paediatric VWD indication. The subsequently included mising information 'Off-label use in paediatric haemophilia A patients' should be changed to 'Use in paediatric haemophilia A patients'. The MAH commited to adapt the RMP accordingly in the upcoming variation.

No new pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed in this RMP update.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Finally, no changes to the risk minimisation measures have been proposed in this update.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, Annex II has been updated to amend the address of the manufacturing sites and the Labelling was updated with some editorial changes.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

## Routine prophylaxis treatment

Adults and adolescents: The median number of bleeding events during 12 months of routine prophylaxis in Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was reduced to 1.0 (range 1 to 6) compared to a median of 26.5 (range 18 to 82) in these patients during the previous 12 months. During prophylaxis in the adults, there were 3 major bleeds in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint bleeds, compared to 8 subjects during on-demand treatment, 5 subjects experienced a median of 7.0 major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median of 34 joint bleeds (range 7 to 58). The single subject in Arm 1 of Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 experienced 10 bleeds during 15 months of routine prophylaxis.

Concerning the on-demand treatment of bleeding events in the 12 paediatric patients &lt;12 years of age in arm 2 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, haemostatic efficacy assessment of excellent or good as reported in about half the bleeds overall may be clinically acceptable but a higher rate of higher efficacy than reported in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 might be clinically desirable. In this regard it is of importance that in these children haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent in 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds which are known to be difficult to treat

## Children &lt;12years:

Out of 4 paediatric subjects &lt;12 years old, 3 of whom had Type 3 VWD, in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 , in 2 of the 3 subjects on prophylaxis both prior to and during study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 the number of major bleeds was reduced compared to their previous prophylactic regimen and in one of these it remained the same. The single subject who  had been on-demand  treatment before going on to prophylaxis in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 had one major bleed on prophylaxis compared to 2 in the prior 12 months of on-demand treatment.

Haemostatic  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  bleeds  occurring  while  on  prophylaxis  was  reported  as  being excellent in all except one bleed in adults (a major mucosal bleed with efficacy rating of good in the single subject in Arm 1) and in the majority of bleeds in children &lt; 12 years (efficacy rating of excellent in 80.8% of 73 bleeds and good in the rest).

## Haemostatic efficacy in on-demand treatment

## Adults and adolescents:

In study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 the investigator assessed haemostatic efficacy assessment in 407 events as excellent in 92.1%, good in 6.1% and moderate in 1.7%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Major bleeding events: For the 125 major bleeds, the distribution of investigator efficacy ratings was very similar. Overall, the haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event was assessed as excellent for 480/606 (79.1%) days, good for 104/606 (17.2%) and moderate for 21/606 (3.5%).

## Children &lt;12years:

In paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 haemostatic efficacy assessment by the investigator in 80 events in 12 subjects was excellent in 45.0% and good in 55.0%.

Major bleeding events: For 26 major bleeds the distribution of investigator efficacy ratings was similar to that overall.

Overall, the subjects assessed haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event as excellent for 60/76 bleeding days (78.9%) and as good for the remaining 16 bleeding days (21.1%).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The children on routine prophylaxis experienced many more bleeds (median 23.5) during the 12 month period than the adults (median 1.0) on routine prophylaxis. Similarly, the investigator rated haemostatic efficacy as excellent in the treatment of bleeding events during the on-demand treatment periods less frequently  in  the  paediatric  &lt;12  years  of  age  (45%)  than  in  the  adult  patients  (92.1%)  although  the subjects' assessment per day of bleeding event was similar.

Factors which may explain the lower efficacy observed in the paediatric subjects 12 years old have not been fully explored. Ongoing post authorisation studies agreed with the MAA may provide more information.

No subjects aged from 12 to 18 years have been treated with a routine prophylaxis regimen, however pharmacokinetics in adolescents is similar to that of the adult population.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Across the clinical studies in VWD, the percentage of subjects who experienced any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) ranged from approximately 68% to 96%, however, the percentage of subjects who experienced a possibly related TEAE ranged from approximately 9% to 17%.

Overall the adverse events reported in the clinical studies were mild and none led to discontinuation.

There has been one report of development of a low responding inhibiting antibody to VWF which occurred in a paediatric subject with Type 3 VWD after 4 years on long term prophylaxis. Otherwise there have been no reports of inhibitor development either in the clinical studies or post-marketing.

Post-marketing, including previous generations of this human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, there have been 12 reports of hypersensitivity and 1 report of anaphylactic reaction.

Incorrect dosing due to product labelling in units of FVIII and VWF has occurred in 3 subjects in the PK part of paediatric study CSLCT-08-52 and the risk for dosing errors has been addressed in the RMP

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The number of patients with VWD in the clinical trials is small with regard to detecting uncommon adverse events such as the occurrence of inhibitor to VWD. Additional information is expected from post marketing surveillance in the PSURs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

A VWF concentrate is currently the only effective treatment to improve haemostasis in subjects with a severe VWD phenotype.

The reduction in the number of bleeding events in a period of 12 months seen in the adult population, is clearly  of  value  in  terms  of  reduced  morbidity  and  risk  of  life  threatening  mucosal  bleeds,  especially gastrointestinal bleeds and also joint bleeds. Subjects with Type 3 VWD also have very low circulating levels of FVIII as VWF is a carrier for FVIII in plasma and are thus prone to joint bleeds similar to patients with haemophilia A.

The aim of prophylaxis is to reduce the frequency of spontaneous and traumatic bleeds as far as possible. Current data on the 4 paediatric patients under 12 years of age who received routine prophylaxis, are limited by the small number and heterogeneity of patients, thus the magnitude of the efficacy in reducing the number  and  severity  of  bleeds  experienced  by  these  subjects  while  on  prophylaxis,  is  difficult  to  be unequivocally demonstrated.

Concerning the on-demand treatment of bleeding events in the 12 paediatric patients &lt;12 years of age in arm 2 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, haemostatic efficacy is clinically acceptable and it is of importance that in cases of haemostatic efficacy rated as excellent in 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds which are known to be difficult  to  treat,  was  achieved. Overall, in children  &lt;12 years, approximately 97% of all bleeds in the prophylaxis arm were rated as minor compared to 73% in the on-demand arm

Unfavourable effects in terms of adverse events were minimal and in line  with those expected with a coagulation factor concentrate however, administration of the product up to 3 times weekly can be seen as a burden to the patient.

## Benefit-risk balance

Concerning routine prophylaxis in adult patients, the benefit in terms of reduction in the number of bleeding events is considered to be unequivocally established.

The unfavourable effects of treatment with the human coagulation factor VIII/VWF in terms of adverse events were few and most were not of clinical significance. Thus in these patients, the efficacy of routine prophylaxis can be considered to outweigh the mild adverse event profile and the burden of administrations up to 3 times weekly.

In paediatric patients &lt;12 years, it remains difficult to assess the value of the prophylactic regimen used in this small number of patients. However adverse events reported were generally mild.

In general, any reduction in the number and severity of bleeds would have to be weighed in each individual against the burden of administration of the product up to 3 times weekly.

In patients of all ages efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events was adequate and outweighs the mild adverse event profile.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events in paediatric patients outweighs unfavourable effects and data confirm that dosing based on weight is appropriate also in paediatric patients.

Concerning routine prophylaxis in paediatric patients &lt;12 years old, 3 of the 4 patients in whom prophylaxis was investigated were already on at least 12 months prophylaxis before entering the study and 3 of the 4 had Type 3 VWD. Furthermore, none of them stopped the prophylaxis regimen during the study. There are few reports available in the literature concerning routine prophylaxis in VWD but it is advocated by some

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experts at an early age in subjects with a phenotype of severe VWD (Abshire et al. Prophylaxis in severe forms of von Willebrand's disease: results from the von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (VWD PN) Haemophilia 2013, Lassila et al Semin Thromb Haemost 2011) in order to prevent joint damage and to reduce  the  number  of  mucosal  bleeds  which  are  potentially  serious.  In  a  study  with  the  VWF/FVIII concentrate Wilate, 11 patients &lt; 6 years with phenotypically severe VWD experienced 68 bleeding events over a 12 month period on routine prophylaxis (Nowak-Göttl et al. Haemophilia 2013).

Thus  it  seems  justified  to  view  children  with  phenotypically  severe  VWD  as  a  population  in  need  of prophylaxis  and  not  to  exclude  paediatric  VWD  patients  &lt;12  years  old  from  an  indication  in  routine prophylaxis. The data obtained from children &lt;12 years on routine prophylaxis with Voncento are limited in that only 4 subjects received prophylaxis, although it is of value that 3 of these subjects were &lt;6 years old during the study.

## Conclusion

The benefit-risk balance for the modification of the indication to 'Prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated.' is considered positive.

The initial MAA in Europe included the interim study report for study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 that presented the results up to the Month 12 visit. In this submission, the interim study report was replaced by the final study report  which  included  an  additional  12  months  of  prophylaxis  treatment  results,  completing  the  entire 24-month treatment period of the study.

Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposes  to  revise  the  paediatric  information  in  various  sections  of  the  SmPC, following the completion of Study CSL-CT-08-52 in children ≤12 years old with VWD.

The benefit- risk balance for both the treatment of bleeding events and for routine prophylaxis in paediatric patients with VWD is also considered to be positive.

The  dosage  proposed  in  the  paediatric  population,  in  particular  patients  &lt;12  years  old  is  considered acceptable provided the proposal for SmPC posology Section 4.2 is modified as indicated in Section 4 'Recommendations' of this report.

## 4. Recommendations
