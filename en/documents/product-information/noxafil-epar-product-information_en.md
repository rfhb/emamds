## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Noxafil oral suspension is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults (see section 5.1):

- -Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is ref ractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;
- -Fusariosis in patients with disease that is ref ractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are intolerant of  amphotericin B;
- -Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole;
- -Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;
- -Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are immunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor.

Refractoriness is defined as progression of inf ection or f ailure to improve af ter a minimum of  7 days of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy .

Noxafil oral suspension is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients:

- -Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high-risk of developing invasive fungal infections;
- -Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high-risk of developing invasive fungal infections.

Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion and the gastro-resistant tablets f or use in primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in the supportive care of high-risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.

## Non-interchangeability between Noxafil oral suspension and Noxafil tablets or Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension

Noxafil oral suspension is indicated f or the adult population (≥18 years old) only. Another f ormulation (Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension) is available for paediatric patients from 2 years to less than 18 years of age.

The oral suspension is not to be used interchangeably with either the tablet or gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension due to the differences in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration achieved. Therefore, follow the specific dose recommendations for each formulation.

## Posology

Noxafil is also available as 100 mg gastro-resistant tablet, 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, and 300 mg gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. Noxafil tablets generally provide higher plasma drug exposures than Noxafil oral suspension under both fed and fasted conditions. Therefore, the tablets are the preferred formulation over the oral suspension to optimize plasma concentrations.

Recommended dose is shown in Table 1.

| Refractory invasive fungal infections (IFI)/patients with IFI intolerant to 1 st line therapy | 200 mg (5 mL) four times a day. Alternatively, patients who can tolerate food or a nutritional supplement may take 400 mg (10 mL) twice a day during or immediately following a meal or nutritional supplement. Duration oftherapy should be based on the severity ofthe underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Each dose ofNoxafil should be administered during or immediately after a meal, or a nutritional supplement in patients who cannot tolerate food to enhance the oral absorption and to ensure adequate exposure. The duration of therapy is based on recovery from neutropenia or immunosuppression. For patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, prophylaxis with Noxafil should start several days before the anticipated onset ofneutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 500 cells permm 3 . |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

An effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Limited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic liver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is necessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole oral suspension have not been established in children and adolescents aged below 18 years. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. Two other oral formulations, Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and Noxafil tablets, are available for the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

For oral use

The oral suspension must be shaken well before use.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Co-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Co-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin (see section 4.5).

Co-administration during the initiation and dose-titration phase of venetoclax in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing posaconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.

## Hepatic toxicity

Hepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes have been reported.

Posaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical experience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Monitoring of hepatic function

Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during posaconazole therapy must be routinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver f unction tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with development of liver disease.

## QTc prolongation

Some azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Posaconazole must not be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as:

- Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation
- Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure
- Sinus bradycardia
- Existing symptomatic arrhythmias
- Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).

Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.

## Drug interactions

Posaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during treatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of posaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).

## Vincristine toxicity

Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).

## Venetoclax toxicity

Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including posaconazole, with the CYP3A4 substrate venetoclax, may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Refer to the venetoclax SmPC f or detailed guidance.

## Rifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), flucloxacillin, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone), efavirenz and cimetidine

Posaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.5).

## Gastrointestinal dysfunction

There are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as severe diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Photosensitivity reaction

Posaconazole may cause increased risk of photosensitivity reaction. Patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure during treatment without adequate protection such as protective clothing and sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).

## Glucose

This medicinal product contains approximately 1.75 g of glucose per 5 mL of suspension. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## Sodium benzoate

This medicinal product contains 10 mg of sodium benzoate (E211) per 5 mL of suspension.

## Benzyl alcohol

This medicinal product contains up to 1.25 mg of benzyl alcohol per 5 mL of suspension. Benzyl alcohol may cause anaphylactoid reactions.

## Propylene glycol

This medicinal product contains up to 24.75 mg of propylene glycol (E1520) per 5 mL of suspension.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of other medicinal products on posaconazole

Posaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp) eff lux in vitro . Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rif ampicin, rif abutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.

## Rifabutin

Rifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the ef fect of posaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels.

## Flucloxacillin

Flucloxacillin (a CYP450 inducer) may decrease plasma posaconazole concentrations. Concomitant use of posaconazole and flucloxacillin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.4).

## Efavirenz

Efavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## Fosamprenavir

Combining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x 10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the 1 st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2 nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 days) by 21 % and 23 %, respectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with ritonavir is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Phenytoin

Phenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors

Posaconazole plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) were reduced by 39 % when posaconazole was administered with cimetidine (400 mg twice a day) due to reduced absorption possibly secondary to a decrease in gastric acid production. Co-administration of posaconazole with H2 receptor antagonists should be avoided if possible.

Similarly, administration of 400 mg posaconazole with esomeprazole (40 mg daily) decreased mean Cmax and AUC by 46 % and 32 %, respectively, compared to dosing with 400 mg posaconazole alone. Co-administration of posaconazole with proton pump inhibitors should be avoided if possible.

## Food

The absorption of posaconazole is significantly increased by food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Effects of posaconazole on other medicinal products

Posaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the effects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during coadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of the CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be associated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate and/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole occurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The ef fect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 substrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is expected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The eff ect of  co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be variable within a patient, unless posaconazole is administered in a strictly standardised way with food, given the large f ood ef f ect on posaconazole exposure (see section 5.2).

Terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates) Co-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).

## Ergot alkaloids

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot alkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin)

Posaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be discontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).

## Vinca alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of  CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

serious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.

## Rifabutin

Posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see also above regarding the ef fect of rif abutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions related to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.

## Sirolimus

Repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-f old and 8.9-fold (range 3.1 to 17.5-f old), respectively, in healthy subjects. The eff ect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients is unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Coadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever possible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. Sirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly . It should be noted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-administration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the usual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that f all in the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid to clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.

## Ciclosporin

In heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once daily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin levels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of leukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with posaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. to about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.

## Tacrolimus

Posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % and 358 %, respectively. Clinically signif icant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or posaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical eff icacy studies. When initiating posaconazole treatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to about one third of the current dose). Thereaf ter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of tacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.

## HIV Protease inhibitors

As HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase plasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), respectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-f old and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The addition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during coadministration with posaconazole.

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4

In a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice daily f or 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg single oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg or 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 8-10 hours during co-administration.

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered when posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).

## Calcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine)

Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel blockers may be required.

## Digoxin

Administration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, posaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored when initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.

## Sulfonylureas

Glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered with posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.

## All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or tretinoin

As ATRA is metabolised by the hepatic CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, concomitant administration with posaconazole, which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, may lead to increased exposure to tretinoin resulting in an increased toxicity (especially hypercalcaemia). Serum calcium levels should be monitored and, if needed, appropriate dose adjustments of tretinoin should be considered during the treatment with posaconazole, and during the following days after treatment.

## Venetoclax

Compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone, co-administration of 300 mg posaconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days in 12 patients, increased venetoclax Cmax to 1.6-f old and 1.9-fold, and AUC to 1.9-f old and 2.4-fold, respectively (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Refer to the venetoclax SmPC.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is insuff icient inf ormation on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole must not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Posaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of posaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on initiation of treatment with posaconazole.

## Fertility

Posaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (1.7 times the 400-mg twice daily regimen based on steady-state plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg (2.2 times the 400-mg twice daily regimen). There is no clinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Since certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with posaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be used.

4.8

Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in &gt; 2,400 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased bilirubin.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

* Based on adverse reactions observed with the oral suspension, gastro-resistant tablets, concentrate for solution f or infusion, and gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension.

§ See section 4.4.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hepatobiliary disorders

During post-marketing surveillance of posaconazole oral suspension, severe hepatic injury with fatal outcome has been reported (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

During clinical studies, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day experienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. Accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice a day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.

Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of overdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC04.

## Mechanism of action

Posaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14α -demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Microbiology

Posaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the f ollowing microorganisms: Aspergillus species ( Aspergillus fumigatus , A. flavus , A. terreus , A. nidulans , A. niger , A. ustus ), Candida species ( Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis ), Coccidioides immitis , Fonsecaea pedrosoi , and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus. The microbiological data suggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus; however the clinical data are currently too limited to assess the eff icacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical signif icance is unknown. In a surveillance study of &gt; 3,000 clinical mold isolates from 2010-2018, 90 % of  nonAspergillus f ungi exhibited the following in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Mucorales spp (n=81) of 2 mg/L; Scedosporium apiospermum/S. boydii (n=65) of 2 mg/L; Exophiala dermatiditis (n=15) of 0.5 mg/L, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (n=21) of  1 mg/L.

## Resistance

Clinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle mechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for posaconazole and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitoryconcentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

## Combination with other antifungal agents

The use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will provide an added benefit.

## Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships

A correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical outcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is particularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected with Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens and the effects of food on absorption).

## Clinical experience

## Summary of posaconazole oral suspension studies

## Invasive aspergillosis

Oral posaconazole suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a noncomparative salvage therapy study (Study 0041). Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an external control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control group included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the same sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered to be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external control group (79 %).

As shown in Table 3, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment was seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, this was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external control group should be viewed with caution.

## Fusarium spp .

11 of 24 patients who had proven or probable fusariosis were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 124 days and up to 212 days. Among eighteen patients who were intolerant or had inf ections ref ractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, seven patients were classed as responders.

## Chromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma

9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.

## Coccidioidomycosis

11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of signs and symptoms present at baseline ) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.

## Treatment of azole-susceptible Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (OPC)

A randomised, evaluator-blind, controlled study was completed in HIV-infected patients with azolesusceptible oropharyngeal candidiasis (most patients studied had C. albicans isolated at baseline). The primary efficacy variable was the clinical success rate (defined as cure or improvement) after 14 days of treatment. Patients were treated with posaconazole or fluconazole oral suspension (both posaconazole and fluconazole were given as follows: 100 mg twice a day for 1 day followed by 100 mg once a day for 13 days).

The clinical response rates from the above study are shown in the Table 4 below. Posaconazole was shown to be non-inferior to fluconazole for clinical success rates at Day 14 as well as 4 weeks after the end of treatment.

Table 4. Clinical success rates in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis

| Endpoint                                            | Posaconazole    | Fluconazole     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Clinical success rate at Day 14                     | 91.7% (155/169) | 92.5% (148/160) |
| Clinical success rate 4 weeks after end oftreatment | 68.5% (98/143)  | 61.8% (84/136)  |

Clinical success rate was defined as the number of cases assessed as having a clinical response (cure or improvement) divided by the total number of cases eligible for analysis.

## Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)

Two randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high-risk for developing invasive fungal infections.

Study 316 was a randomised, double-blind study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell

1  Includes other less common species or species unknown

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transplant recipients with graf t-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary ef ficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs during the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The majority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive (195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole and 77 days for f luconazole.

Study 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg twice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel during the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most common underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for posaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.

In both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 5 and 6 for results f rom both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.

In Study 1899, a significant decrease in all-cause mortality in favour of posaconazole was observed [POS 49/304 (16 %) vs. FLU/ITZ 67/298 (22 %) p= 0.048]. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the probability of  survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole recipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death (P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).

In Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFIrelated deaths was signif icantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU group (12/299; P= 0.0413).

## Paediatric population

No dose of posaconazole oral suspension could be recommended for paediatric patients. However, the safety and eff icacy of other formulations of posaconazole (Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension; Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion) have been established in paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age. Ref er to their SmPC for additional inf ormation.

## Electrocardiogram evaluation

Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12-hour period were obtained before and during administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from 173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Posaconazole is absorbed with a median Tmax of 3 hours (fed patients). The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are linear following single and multiple dose administration of up to 800 mg when taken with a high fat meal. No further increases in exposure were observed when doses above 800 mg daily were administered to patients and healthy volunteers. In the fasting state, AUC increased less than in proportion to dose above 200 mg. In healthy volunteers under fasting conditions, dividing the total daily dose (800 mg) into 200 mg four times daily compared to 400 mg twice daily, was shown to increase posaconazole exposure by 2.6-fold.

## Effect of food on oral absorption in healthy volunteers

The absorption of posaconazole was significantly increased when posaconazole 400 mg (once daily) was administered during and immediately after the consumption of a high fat meal (~ 50 grams fat) compared to administration before a meal, with Cmax and AUC increasing by approximately 330 % and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

360 %, respectively. The AUC of posaconazole is: 4 times greater when administered with a high-fat meal (~ 50 grams fat) and about 2.6 times greater when administered during a non-fat meal or nutritional supplement (14 grams fat) relative to the fasted state (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).

## Distribution

Posaconazole is slowly absorbed and slowly eliminated with a large apparent volume of distribution (1,774 litres) and is highly protein bound (&gt; 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.

## Biotransformation

Posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to be altered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % of  the administered radiolabelled dose.

## Elimination

Posaconazole is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t½) of  35 hours (range 20 to 66 hours). After administration of 14 C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of the radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled dose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted in urine (&lt; 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state is attained following 7 to 10 days of multiple-dose administration.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Children (&lt; 18 years)

Following administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole as a divided dose for treatment of invasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 - 17 years of age (776 ng/mL) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 - 64 years of age (817 ng/mL). Similarly, in the prophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) was comparable among ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (≥ 18 years of age). In a study of 136 neutropenic paediatric patients 11 months -17 years treated with posaconazole oral suspension at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day divided TID, approximately 50 % met the pre-specified target (Day 7 Cav between 500 ng/mL-2,500 ng/mL). In general, exposures tended to be higher in the older patients (7 to &lt;18 years) than in younger patients (2 to &lt;7 years).

## Gender

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in men and women.

## Elderly

An increase in Cmax (26 %) and AUC (29 %) was observed in elderly subjects (24 subjects /uniF0B3 65 years of age) relative to younger subjects (24 subjects 18 - 45 years of age). However, in clinical efficacy studies, the safety prof ile of  posaconazole between the young and elderly patients was similar.

## Race

There was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black subjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety prof ile of posaconazole between the Black and Caucasian subjects was similar.

## Weight

The population pharmacokinetic model of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablets indicates that posaconazole clearance is related to weight. In patients &gt; 120 kg, the C av is decreased by 25 % and in patients &lt; 50 kg, the Cav is increased by 19 %. It is, theref ore, suggested to closely monitor f or breakthrough f ungal inf ections in patients weighing more than 120 kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Following single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild and moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; therefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr &lt; 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [&gt; 96 % CV (coefficient of variance)] compared to other renal groups [&lt; 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not significantly renally eliminated, an ef fect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis.

## Hepatic impairment

After a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per group), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that there is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total AUC. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in respective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment but caution is advised due to the potential f or higher plasma exposure.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

As observed with other azole antifungal agents, ef fects related to inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects were observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans.

Neuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for /uniF0B3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one year. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed on the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved therapeutically.

Pulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the 2-year study in rats. These f indings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for f unctional changes in humans.

No effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in monkeys at systemic exposures 4.6-fold greater than the concentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 1.4-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 1.4-fold and 4.6-fold greater, respectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.

Reproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and malformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered to be due to a treatment-related ef fect on steroidogenesis.

Posaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal special hazards for humans.

Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of Noxafil oral suspension for use in oropharyngeal candidiasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in the supportive care of  high-risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.

## Non-interchangeability between Noxafil tablets and Noxafil oral suspension

The tablet is not to be used interchangeably with the oral suspension due to the dif ferences between these two formulations in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration achieved. Therefore, follow the specific dose recommendations for each formulation.

## Posology

Noxafil is also available as 40 mg/mL oral suspension, 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, and 300 mg gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. Noxafil tablets generally provide higher plasma drug exposures than Noxafil oral suspension under both fed and fasted conditions. Therefore, the tablets are the preferred formulation to optimise plasma concentrations.

Recommended dose in paediatric patients from 2 years of age weighing more than 40 kg and in adults is shown in Table 1.

Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension is recommended for oral use in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older weighing 40 kg or less. Refer to the gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension SmPC for additional dosing information.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

An effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Limited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic liver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is necessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole in children aged below 2 years have not been established. No clinical data are available.

## Method of administration

## For oral use

Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and should not be crushed, chewed, or broken.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Co-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Co-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin (see section 4.5).

Co-administration during the initiation and dose-titration phase of venetoclax in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing posaconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.

## Hepatic toxicity

Hepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes have been reported.

Posaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical experience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Monitoring of hepatic function

Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during posaconazole therapy must be routinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver f unction tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with development of liver disease.

## QTc prolongation

Some azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Posaconazole must not be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as:

- Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation
- Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure
- Sinus bradycardia
- Existing symptomatic arrhythmias
- Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).

Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.

## Drug interactions

Posaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during treatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of posaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).

## Vincristine toxicity

Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).

## Venetoclax toxicity

Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including posaconazole, with the CYP3A4 substrate venetoclax, may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Refer to the venetoclax SmPC f or detailed guidance.

## Rifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), flucloxacillin, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz.

Posaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.5).

## Plasma exposure

Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets are generally higher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets may increase over time in some patients (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gastrointestinal dysfunction

There are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as severe diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal inf ections.

## Photosensitivity reaction

Posaconazole may cause increased risk of photosensitivity reaction. Patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure during treatment without adequate protection such as protective clothing and sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of other medicinal products on posaconazole

Posaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp) eff lux in vitro . Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rif ampicin, rif abutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.

## Rifabutin

Rifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the ef fect of posaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels.

## Flucloxacillin

Flucloxacillin (a CYP450 inducer) may decrease plasma posaconazole concentrations. Concomitant use of posaconazole and flucloxacillin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.4).

## Efavirenz

Efavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## Fosamprenavir

Combining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x 10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the 1 st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2 nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, respectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with ritonavir is unknown.

## Phenytoin

Phenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors

No clinically relevant effects were observed when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. No dose adjustment of posaconazole tablets is required when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors.

## Effects of posaconazole on other medicinal products

Posaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the effects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during coadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of the CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be associated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate and/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole occurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The ef fect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 substrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is expected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The eff ect of  co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be variable within a patient.

Terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates) Co-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).

## Ergot alkaloids

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot alkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin)

Posaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be discontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).

## Vinca alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of  CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, f or patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.

## Rifabutin

Posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see also above regarding the ef fect of rif abutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions related to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sirolimus

Repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-f old and 8.9-fold (range 3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The eff ect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients is unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Coadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever possible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. Sirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly . It should be noted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-administration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the usual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that f all in the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid to clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.

## Ciclosporin

In heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once daily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin levels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of leukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with posaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. to about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.

## Tacrolimus

Posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % and 358 %, respectively. Clinically signif icant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or posaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical eff icacy studies. When initiating posaconazole treatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to about one third of the current dose). Thereaf ter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of tacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.

## HIV Protease inhibitors

As HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase plasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), respectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-f old and 2.5-f old (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The addition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated with increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during coadministration with posaconazole.

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4

In a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice daily f or 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

single oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg or 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 8-10 hours during co-administration.

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered when posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).

## Calcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine)

Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel blockers may be required.

## Digoxin

Administration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, posaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored when initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.

## Sulfonylureas

Glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered with posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.

## All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or tretinoin

As ATRA is metabolised by the hepatic CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, concomitant administration with posaconazole, which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, may lead to increased exposure to tretinoin resulting in an increased toxicity (especially hypercalcaemia). Serum calcium levels should be monitored and, if needed, appropriate dose adjustments of tretinoin should be considered during the treatment with posaconazole, and during the following days after treatment.

## Venetoclax

Compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone, co-administration of 300 mg posaconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days in 12 patients, increased venetoclax Cmax to 1.6-f old and 1.9-fold, and AUC to 1.9-f old and 2.4-f old, respectively (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Refer to the venetoclax SmPC.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is insuff icient inf ormation on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole must not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Posaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of posaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on initiation of treatment with posaconazole.

## Fertility

Posaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (3.4 times the 300-mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(2.6 times the 300-mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients). There is no clinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Since certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with posaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be used.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Safety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension.

The safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in &gt; 2,400 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased bilirubin.

## Posaconazole tablets

The safety of posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 104 healthy volunteers and 230 patients enrolled in a clinical study of antifungal prophylaxis.

The safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 288 patients enrolled in a clinical study of aspergillosis of whom 161 patients received the concentrate for solution for infusion and 127 patients received the tablet formulation.

The tablet formulation was investigated in AML and MDS patients and those after HSCT with or at risk for Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) only. Maximum duration of exposure to the tablet formulation was shorter than with the oral suspension. Plasma exposure resulting from the tablet formulation was higher than observed with the oral suspension.

The safety of posaconazole tablets has been assessed in 230 patients enrolled in the pivotal clinical study. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety study of posaconazole tablets when given as antif ungal prophylaxis. Patients were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including haematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, GVHD, and post HSCT. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days . Twenty patients received 200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on Day 1 in each cohort).

The safety of posaconazole tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion were also investigated in a controlled study of treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The maximum duration of invasive aspergillosis treatment was similar to that studied with the oral suspension for salvage treatment and was longer than that with the tablets or concentrate for solution for infusion in prophylaxis.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

§ See section 4.4.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hepatobiliary disorders

During post-marketing surveillance of posaconazole oral suspension, severe hepatic injury with fatal outcome has been reported (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no experience with overdose of posaconazole tablets.

During clinical studies, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day experienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. Accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice a day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.

Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of overdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC04.

## Mechanism of action

Posaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14α -demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis.

## Microbiology

Posaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the f ollowing microorganisms: Aspergillus species ( Aspergillus fumigatus , A. flavus , A. terreus , A. nidulans , A. niger , A. ustus ), Candida species ( Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis ), Coccidioides immitis , Fonsecaea pedrosoi , and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus. The microbiological data suggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus; however, the clinical data are currently too limited to assess the eff icacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical signif icance is unknown. In a surveillance study of &gt; 3,000 clinical mold isolates from 2010-2018, 90 % of nonAspergillus f ungi exhibited the following in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Mucorales spp (n=81) of 2 mg/L; Scedosporium apiospermum/S. boydii (n=65) of 2 mg/L; Exophiala dermatiditis (n=15) of 0.5 mg/L, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (n=21) of  1 mg/L.

## Resistance

Clinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle mechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for posaconazole and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitoryconcentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

## Combination with other antifungal agents

The use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will provide an added benefit.

## Clinical experience

Summary of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablet study invasive aspergillosis The safety and efficacy of posaconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was evaluated in a double-blind controlled study (study-69) in 575 patients with proven, probable, or possible invasive fungal inf ections per EORTC/MSG criteria.

Patients were treated with posaconazole (n=288) concentrate for solution for infusion or tablet given at a dose of 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1). Comparator patients were treated with voriconazole (n=287) given IV at a dose of 6 mg/kg BID Day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg BID, or orally at a dose of 300 mg BID Day 1 followed by 200 mg BID. Median treatment duration was 67 days (posaconazole) and 64 days (voriconazole).

In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug), 288 patients received posaconazole and 287 patients received voriconazole. The full analysis set population (FAS) is the subset of all subjects within the ITT population who were classified by independent adjudication as having proven or probable invasive aspergillosis: 163 subjects for posaconazole and 171 subjects for voriconazole. The all-cause mortality and global clinical response in these two populations are presented in Table 3 and 4, respectively.

## Summary of posaconazole tablet bridging study

Study 5615 was a non-comparative multi-centre study performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, and tolerability of  posaconazole tablet. Study 5615 was conducted in a similar patient population to that previously studied in the pivotal posaconazole oral suspension clinical program. The pharmacokinetics and safety data from Study 5615 were bridged to the existing data (including efficacy data) with the oral suspension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The subject population included: 1) patients with AML or MDS who had recently received chemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia, or 2) patients who had undergone a HSCT and were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prevention or treatment of GVHD. Two different dosing groups were evaluated: 200 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200 mg once daily thereafter (Part IA) and 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 300 mg once daily thereafter (Part 1B and Part 2).

Serial PK samples were collected on Day 1 and at steady-state on Day 8 for all Part 1 subjects and a subset of Part 2 subjects. Moreover, sparse PK samples were collected at several days during steady state before the next dose (C min ) f or a larger subject population. Based on average C min concentrations, a predicted average concentration (Cav) could be calculated for 186 subjects dosed with 300 mg. PK analysis in patients of C av f ound that 81 % of the subjects treated with the 300 mg once daily dose attained steady state predicted Cav between 500-2,500 ng/mL. One subject (&lt;1 %) had a predicted Cav below 500 ng/mL and 19 % of the subjects had a predicted Cav above 2,500 ng/mL. Subjects achieved a mean predicted Cav at steady state of 1,970 ng/mL.

In Table 5 a comparison is shown of exposure (Cav) after administration of posaconazole tablet and posaconazole oral suspension at therapeutic doses in patients depicted as quartile analysis. Exposures after tablet administration are generally higher than, but overlapping with, exposures af ter administration of posaconazole oral suspension.

## Summary of posaconazole oral suspension studies

## Invasive aspergillosis

Oral posaconazole suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a noncomparative salvage therapy study (Study 0041). Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an external control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control group included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the same sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered to be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external control group (79 %).

As shown in Table 6, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment was seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external control group should be viewed with caution.

## Fusarium spp .

11 of 24 patients who had proven or probable fusariosis were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 124 days and up to 212 days. Among eighteen patients who were intolerant or had inf ections ref ractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, seven patients were classed as responders.

## Chromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma

9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.

## Coccidioidomycosis

11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of signs and symptoms present at baseline ) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.

## Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)

Two randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high-risk for developing invasive fungal infections.

Study 316 was a randomised, double-blind study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with graf t-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary ef ficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs during the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The majority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive (195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole and 77 days for fluconazole.

Study 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg twice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel during the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most

common underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for posaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.

In both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 7 and 8 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.

In Study 1899, a signif icant decrease in all cause mortality in favour of posaconazole was observed [POS 49/304 (16 %) vs. FLU/ITZ 67/298 (22 %) p= 0.048]. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the probability of  survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole recipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death (P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).

In Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFIrelated deaths was signif icantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU group (12/299; P= 0.0413).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is limited paediatric experience for posaconazole tablets.

Three patients 14-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablet 300 mg/day (BID on Day 1 followed by QD thereafter) in the study of treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole (Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension; Noxafil concentrate for solution for inf usion) have been established in paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of  age. Use of posaconazole in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of posaconazole in adults and pharmacokinetic and safety data from paediatric studies (see section 5.2). No new safety signals associated with the use of posaconazole in paediatric patients were identified in the paediatric studies (see section 4.8).

Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

No data are available.

## Electrocardiogram evaluation

Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from 173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships

A correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical outcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is particularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected with Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens).

## Absorption

Posaconazole tablets are absorbed with a median Tmax of 4 to 5 hours and exhibits dose proportional pharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing up to 300 mg.

Following a single dose administration of 300 mg posaconazole tablets after a high fat meal to healthy volunteers, the AUC0-72 hours and Cmax were higher compared to administration under fasted condition (51 % and 16 % for AUC0-72 hours and Cmax respectively). Based on a population pharmacokinetic model, posaconazole Cav is increased 20 % when given with a meal compared to a fasted state.

Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets may increase over time in some patients. The reason for this time-dependency is not completely understood.

## Distribution

Posaconazole, after administration of the tablet, has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 394 L (42 %), ranging between 294-583 L among the studies in healthy volunteers.

Posaconazole is highly protein bound (&gt; 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.

## Biotransformation

Posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to be altered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % of  the administered radiolabelled dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Posaconazole after administration of the tablets, is slowly eliminated with a mean half-lif e (t½) of 29 hours (range 26 to 31 hours) and a mean apparent clearance ranging from 7.5 to 11 L/hr. Af ter administration of 14 C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of the radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled dose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted in urine (&lt; 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose (once daily af ter twice daily loading dose at Day 1).

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

Based on a population pharmacokinetic model evaluating posaconazole pharmacokinetics, steady state posaconazole concentrations were predicted in patients administered posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion or tablets 300 mg once a day following BID dosing on Day 1 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections.

Table 9. Population predicted median (10 th percentile, 90 th percentile) posaconazole steady state plasma concentrations in patients f ollowing administration of posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion or tablets 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1)

| Regimen                               | Population                          | C av (ng/mL)             | C min (ng/mL)            |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tablet-(Fasted)                       | Prophylaxis Treatment of Invasive   | 1,550 (874; 2,690) 1,780 | 1,330 (667; 2,400) 1,490 |
| Concentrate for Solution for Infusion | Prophylaxis                         | 1,890 (1,100; 3,150)     | 1,500 (745; 2,660)       |
|                                       | Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis | 2,240 (1,230; 4,160)     | 1,780 (874; 3,620)       |

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole in patients suggests that race, sex, renal impairment and disease (prophylaxis or treatment) have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole.

## Children (&lt; 18 years)

There is limited (n=3) paediatric experience with posaconazole tablets.

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole oral suspension have been evaluated in paediatric patients. Following administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole oral suspension as a divided dose for treatment of invasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 -17 years of age (776 ng/mL) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 -64 years of age (817 ng/mL). No pharmacokinetic data are available from paediatric patients less than 8 years of age. Similarly, in the prophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) was comparable among ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (≥ 18 years of age).

## Gender

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in men and women.

## Elderly

No overall differences in safety were observed between the geriatric patients and younger patients.

The population pharmacokinetic model of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablets indicates that posaconazole clearance is related to age. Posaconazole C av is generally comparable between young and elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age); however, the Cav is increased by 11 % in the very elderly ( ≥ 80 years). It is, theref ore, suggested to closely monitor very elderly patients (≥ 80 years) for adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in young and elderly subjects ( ≥ 65 years of age).

Pharmacokinetic differences based upon age are not considered to be clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment is required.

## Race

There is insuff icient data among dif ferent races with posaconazole tablets.

There was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black subjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety prof ile of posaconazole between the Black and Caucasian subjects was similar.

## Weight

The population pharmacokinetic model of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablets indicates that posaconazole clearance is related to weight. In patients &gt; 120 kg, the C av is decreased by 25 % and in patients &lt;50 kg, the Cav is increased by 19 %.

It is, theref ore, suggested to closely monitor f or breakthrough f ungal inf ections in patients weighing more than 120 kg.

## Renal impairment

Following single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild and moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; therefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr &lt; 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [&gt; 96 % CV (coefficient of variance)] compared to other renal groups [&lt; 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not significantly renally eliminated, an ef fect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis.

Similar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been conducted with the posaconazole tablets.

## Hepatic impairment

After a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per group), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that there is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total AUC. The elimination half-life (t½) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in respective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment but caution is advised due to the potential f or higher plasma exposure.

Similar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been conducted with the posaconazole tablets.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

As observed with other azole antifungal agents, ef fects related to inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects were observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans.

Neuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for /uniF0B3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one year. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed on the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved therapeutically.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the 2-year study in rats. These f indings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for f unctional changes in humans.

No effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.5-fold greater than the concentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 2.1-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 2.1-fold and 8.5-fold greater, respectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.

Reproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and malformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered to be due to a treatment-related ef fect on steroidogenesis.

Posaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal special hazards for humans.

In a nonclinical study using intravenous administration of posaconazole in very young dogs (dosed from 2-8 weeks of age) an increase in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement was observed in treated animals as compared with concurrent control animals. No difference in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent 5 month treatment-free period. There were no neurologic, behavioural or developmental abnormalities in the dogs with this finding, and a similar brain f inding was not seen with either oral posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (4 days to 9 months of age) or intravenous posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (10 weeks to 23 weeks of age). The clinical signif icance of this finding is unknown.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in the supportive care of  high-risk patients f or which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.

## Posology

Noxafil is also available for oral administration (Noxaf il 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets, 40 mg/mL oral suspension, and 300 mg gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension). A switch to oral administration is recommended as soon as the patients' condition allows (see section 4.4).

Recommended dose is shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Recommended dose according to indication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Noxafil should be administered via a central venous line, including a central venous catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) by slow intravenous infusion over approximately 90 minutes. Noxafil concentrate for solution for inf usion should not be given by bolus administration. If a central venous catheter is not available, a single inf usion may be administered through a peripheral venous catheter. When administered through a peripheral venous catheter, the infusion should be administered over approximately 30 minutes (see sections 4.8 and 6.6).

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, Betadex Sulf obutyl Ether Sodium (SBECD), is expected to occur. Oral formulations of Noxafil should be used in these patients unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justif ies the use of  Noxaf il concentrate f or solution f or inf usion. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients (see section 4.4).

## Hepatic impairment

Limited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic liver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is necessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole in children aged below 2 years have not been established. No clinical data are available.

Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be used in children aged below 2 years because of pre-clinical safety concerns (see section 5.3).

## Method of administration

Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion requires dilution (see section 6.6) prior to administration. Noxafil should be administered via a central venous line, including a central venous catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 90 minutes (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8).

Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion should not be given by bolus administration.

If a central venous catheter is not available, a single inf usion may be administered through a peripheral venous catheter. When administered through a peripheral venous catheter, the infusion should be administered over approximately 30 minutes to reduce the likelihood of infusion site reactions (see section 4.8).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Co-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Co-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin (see section 4.5).

Co-administration during the initiation and dose-titration phase of venetoclax in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing posaconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.

## Hepatic toxicity

Hepatic reactions (e.g. elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes have been reported.

Posaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical experience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Monitoring of patients with severe renal impairment

Due to the variability in exposure, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Monitoring of hepatic function

Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during posaconazole therapy must be routinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver f unction tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with development of liver disease.

## QTc prolongation

Some azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Posaconazole must not be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as:

- Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation
- Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure
- Sinus bradycardia
- Existing symptomatic arrhythmias
- Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).

Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.

In patients, mean maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion are 4-f old increased compared to administration of oral suspension. An increased eff ect on the QTc interval cannot be ruled out. Particular caution is advised in such cases where posaconazole is administered peripherally, as the recommended infusion time of 30 minutes may further increase Cmax.

## Drug interactions

Posaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during treatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of posaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).

## Vincristine toxicity

Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).

## Venetoclax toxicity

Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including posaconazole, with the CYP3A4 substrate venetoclax, may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Refer to the venetoclax SmPC f or detailed guidance.

## Rifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), flucloxacillin, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz

Posaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.5).

## Plasma exposure

Plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole intravenous concentrate for solution for inf usion are generally higher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole may increase over time in some patients (see section 5.2).

## Thromboembolic events

Thromboembolic events have been identified as a potential risk for posaconazole intravenous concentrate for solution for infusion but were not observed in the clinical studies. Thrombophlebitis was observed in clinical studies. Caution is warranted on any sign or symptom of thromboembolic events (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).

## Photosensitivity reaction

Posaconazole may cause increased risk of photosensitivity reaction. Patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure during treatment without adequate protection such as protective clothing and sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 462 mg (20 mmol) sodium per vial, equivalent to 23 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of sodium.

The maximum daily dose of this product is equivalent to 46% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium.

Noxafil 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account f or those on a low salt diet.

## Cyclodextrin

This medicinal product contains 6,680 mg of cyclodextrin per vial.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The following information was derived from data with posaconazole oral suspension or early tablet formulation. All drug interactions with posaconazole oral suspension, except for those that affect the absorption of posaconazole (via gastric pH and motility) are considered relevant to posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion as well.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effects of other medicinal products on posaconazole

Posaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp) eff lux in vitro . Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rif ampicin, rif abutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.

## Rifabutin

Rifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the ef fect of posaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels.

## Flucloxacillin

Flucloxacillin (a CYP450 inducer) may decrease plasma posaconazole concentrations. Concomitant use of posaconazole and flucloxacillin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.4).

## Efavirenz

Efavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## Fosamprenavir

Combining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x 10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the 1 st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2 nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, respectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with ritonavir is unknown.

## Phenytoin

Phenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## Effects of posaconazole on other medicinal products

Posaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the effects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during coadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of the CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be associated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate and/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed.

Terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates) Co-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ergot alkaloids

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot alkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin)

Posaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be discontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).

## Vinca alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of  CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.

## Rifabutin

After oral administration, posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see also above regarding the ef fect of  rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions related to increased rif abutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.

## Sirolimus

Repeat dose administration of oral posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-f old and 8.9-fold (range 3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The eff ect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients is unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Coadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever possible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. Sirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly . It should be noted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-administration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the usual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that f all in the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid to clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.

## Ciclosporin

In heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once daily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin levels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of leukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with posaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. to about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.

## Tacrolimus

Posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % and 358 %, respectively. Clinically signif icant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

posaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical eff icacy studies. When initiating posaconazole treatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to about one third of the current dose). Thereaf ter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of tacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.

## HIV Protease inhibitors

As HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase plasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), respectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-f old and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The addition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated with increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during coadministration with posaconazole.

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4

In a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice daily f or 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg single oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg or 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 810 hours during co-administration.

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered when posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).

## Calcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine)

Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel blockers may be required.

## Digoxin

Administration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, posaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored when initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.

## Sulfonylureas

Glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered with posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.

## All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or tretinoin

As ATRA is metabolised by the hepatic CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, concomitant administration with posaconazole, which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, may lead to increased exposure to tretinoin resulting in an increased toxicity (especially hypercalcaemia). Serum calcium levels should be monitored and, if needed, appropriate dose adjustments of tretinoin should be considered during the treatment with posaconazole, and during the following days after treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Venetoclax

Compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone, co-administration of 300 mg posaconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days in 12 patients, increased venetoclax Cmax to 1.6-f old and 1.9-fold, and AUC to 1.9-f old and 2.4-fold, respectively (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Refer to the venetoclax SmPC.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is insuff icient inf ormation on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole must not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Posaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of posaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on initiation of treatment with posaconazole.

## Fertility

Posaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (2.8 times the exposure achieved from a 300 mg intravenous dose in human) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg (3.4 times the exposure from a 300 mg intravenous dose in patients). There is no clinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Since certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with posaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be used.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Safety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension.

The safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in &gt; 2,400 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased bilirubin.

## Posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion

The safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion has been assessed in 72 healthy volunteers and 268 patients enrolled in a clinical study of antifungal prophylaxis. The safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 288 patients enrolled in a clinical study of aspergillosis of whom 161 patients received the concentrate for solution for infusion and 127 patients received the tablet formulation.

Posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion was investigated in AML and MDS patients and those after HSCT with or at risk for GVHD only. Maximum duration of exposure to the concentrate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for solution for infusion was shorter than with the oral suspension. Plasma exposure resulting from the solution for infusion was higher than observed with the oral suspension.

In initial studies of healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of posaconazole infused over 30 minutes via a peripheral venous catheter was associated with a 12 % incidence of infusion site reactions (4 % incidence of thrombophlebitis). Multiple doses of posaconazole administered via a peripheral venous catheter were associated with thrombophlebitis (60 % incidence). Therefore, in subsequent studies posaconazole was administered via central venous catheter. If a central venous catheter was not readily available, patients could receive a single infusion over 30 minutes via a peripheral venous catheter. Peripheral inf usion time longer than 30 minutes, leads to a higher incidence of infusion site reactions and thrombophlebitis.

The safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion has been assessed in 268 patients in clinical studies. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety study of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion when given as antifungal prophylaxis (Study 5520). Eleven patients received a single dose of 200 mg posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion, 21 patients received 200 mg daily dose for a median of 14 days, and 237 patients received 300 mg daily dose for a median of 9 days. No safety data are available for administration &gt; 28 days. Safety data in the elderly are limited.

The most frequently reported adverse reaction (&gt;25 %) with an onset during the posaconazole intravenous phase of dosing with 300 mg once daily was diarrhoea (32 %).

The most common adverse reaction (&gt;1 %) leading to discontinuation of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion 300 mg once daily was AML (1 %).

The safety of posaconazole tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion were also investigated in a controlled study of treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The maximum duration of invasive aspergillosis treatment was similar to that studied with the oral suspension for salvage treatment and was longer than that with the tablets or concentrate for solution for infusion in prophylaxis.

## Posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion safety

The safety of posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion has been assessed in 115 paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years f or prophylaxis use. Immunocompromised paediatric patients with known or expected neutropenia were exposed to posaconazole at 3.5 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg.

Reported adverse reactions were generally consistent with those expected in a paediatric oncology population undergoing treatment for malignancy or with the safety profile of posaconazole in adults.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (&gt;2 %) during treatment were alanine aminotransferase increased (2.6 %), aspartate aminotransferase increased (3.5 %) and rash (2.6 %). Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

§ See section 4.4.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hepatobiliary disorders

During post-marketing surveillance severe hepatic injury with fatal outcome has been reported (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no experience with overdose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During clinical studies, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day experienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. Accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice a day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.

Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of overdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A C04.

## Mechanism of action

Posaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14α -demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis.

## Microbiology

Posaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the f ollowing microorganisms: Aspergillus species ( Aspergillus fumigatus , A. flavus , A. terreus , A. nidulans , A. niger , A. ustus ), Candida species ( Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis ), Coccidioides immitis , Fonsecaea pedrosoi , and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus. The microbiological data suggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus; however, the clinical data are currently too limited to assess the eff icacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical signif icance is unknown. In a surveillance study of &gt; 3,000 clinical mold isolates from 2010-2018, 90 % of nonAspergillus f ungi exhibited the following in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Mucorales spp (n=81) of 2 mg/L; Scedosporium apiospermum/S. boydii (n=65) of 2 mg/L; Exophiala dermatiditis (n=15) of 0.5 mg/L, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (n=21) of  1 mg/L.

## Resistance

Clinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle mechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for posaconazole and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitoryconcentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

## Combination with other antifungal agents

The use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will provide an added benefit.

## Clinical experience

## Summary of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion bridging study

Study 5520 was a non-comparative multi-center study performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, and tolerability of  posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 5520 enrolled a total of 279 subjects, including 268 receiving at least one dose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion. Cohort 0 was designed to evaluate the tolerability of a single dose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion when administered via a central line. The subject population for Cohorts 1 and 2 included subjects with AML or MDS who had recently received chemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia. Two different dosing groups were evaluated in Cohorts 1 and 2: 200 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200 mg once daily thereafter (Cohort 1) and 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 300 mg once daily thereaf ter (Cohort 2).

The subject population in Cohort 3 included: 1) patients with AML or MDS who had recently received chemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia, or 2) patients who had undergone a HSCT and were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prevention or treatment of GVHD. These types of patients had been previously studied in a pivotal controlled study of posaconazole oral suspension. Based on the pharmacokinetics and safety results of Cohorts 1 and 2, all subjects in Cohort 3 received 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 300 mg once daily thereafter.

The total subject population had a mean age of 51 years (range = 18-82 years), 95 % were White, the major ethnicity was not Hispanic or Latino (92 %), and 55 % were male. The study treated 155 (65 %) subjects with AML or MDS, and 82 (35 %) subjects with HSCT, as the primary diseases at study entry.

Serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 1 and at steady-state on Day 14 for all Cohort 1 and 2 subjects and on Day 10 for a subset of Cohort 3 subjects. This serial pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that 94 % of the subjects treated with the 300 mg once daily dose attained steady state Cav between 500-2,500 ng/mL [Cav was the average concentration of posaconazole at steady state, calculated as AUC/dosing interval (24 hours)]. This exposure was selected based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations with posaconazole oral suspension. Subjects who received 300 mg once daily achieved a mean Cav at steady state of 1,500 ng/mL.

Summary of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablet study invasive aspergillosis The safety and efficacy of posaconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was evaluated in a double-blind controlled study (study-69) in 575 patients with proven, probable, or possible invasive fungal inf ections per EORTC/MSG criteria.

Patients were treated with posaconazole (n=288) concentrate for solution for infusion or tablet given at a dose of 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1). Comparator patients were treated with voriconazole (n=287) given IV at a dose of 6 mg/kg BID Day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg BID of voriconazole (intravenous), or orally at a dose of 300 mg BID Day 1 followed by 200 mg BID. Median treatment duration was 67 days (posaconazole) and 64 days (voriconazole).

In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug), 288 patients received posaconazole and 287 patients received voriconazole. The full analysis set population (FAS) is the subset of all subjects within the ITT population who were classified by independent adjudication as having proven or probable invasive aspergillosis: 163 subjects for posaconazole and 171 subjects for voriconazole. The all-cause mortality and global clinical response in these two populations are presented in Table 3 and 4, respectively

Summary of gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion bridging study

The pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastroresistant powder and solvent for oral suspension have been assessed in 115 paediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years in a non-randomised, multi-centre, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study (Study 097). Immunocompromised paediatric subjects with known or expected neutropenia were exposed to posaconazole at 3.5 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg daily (BID on Day 1). All 115 subjects initially received posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion for at least 7 days, and 63 subjects were transitioned to gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. The mean overall treatment duration (posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension) of all treated subjects was 20.6 days (see section 5.2).

## Summary of posaconazole oral suspension studies

## Invasive aspergillosis

Oral posaconazole suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a noncomparative salvage therapy study. Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an external control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control group included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the same sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered to be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external control group (79 %).

As shown in Table 5 a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment was seen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external control group should be viewed with caution.

## Fusarium spp .

11 of 24 patients who had proven or probable fusariosis were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 124 days and up to 212 days. Among eighteen patients who were intolerant or had infections refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, seven patients were classed as responders.

## Chromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma

9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species.

## Coccidioidomycosis

11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of signs and symptoms present at baseline ) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days.

## Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899)

Two randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high-risk for developing invasive fungal infections.

Study 316 was a randomised, double-blind study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with graf t-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary ef ficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomisation as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs during the on-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The majority (377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive (195/600, [32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole and 77 days for fluconazole.

Study 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg twice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel during the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs at 100 days post-randomisation. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

common underlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for posaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole.

In both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 6 and 7 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients.

In Study 1899, a signif icant decrease in all cause mortality in favour of posaconazole was observed [POS 49/304 (16 %) vs. FLU/ITZ 67/298 (22 %) p= 0.048]. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the probability of  survival up to day 100 after randomisation, was significantly higher for posaconazole recipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death (P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209).

In Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFIrelated deaths was signif icantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU group (12/299; P= 0.0413).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is limited paediatric experience for posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion.

Three patients 14-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablet 300 mg/day (BID on Day 1 followed by QD thereafter) in the study of treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole (Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension; Noxafil concentrate for solution for inf usion) have been established in paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age. Use of posaconazole in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of posaconazole in adults and pharmacokinetic and safety data from paediatric studies (see section 5.2). No new safety signals associated with the use of posaconazole in paediatric patients were identif ied in the paediatric studies (see section 4.8).

Safety and efficacy of Noxafil in paediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

No data are available.

## Electrocardiogram evaluation

Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from 173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships

A correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical outcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is particularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected with Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens).

## Distribution

Following administration of 300 mg posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion over 90 minutes, mean peak plasma concentration at the end of infusion was 3,280 ng/mL (74 % CV). Posaconazole exhibits dose proportional pharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing in the therapeutic dose range (200-300 mg). Posaconazole has a distribution volume of 261 L, indicating extravascular distribution.

Posaconazole is highly protein bound (&gt; 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.

## Biotransformation

Posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % of the administered radiolabelled dose of posaconazole oral suspension.

## Elimination

Posaconazole, after administration of 300 mg of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion, is slowly eliminated with a mean half-lif e (t½) of 27 hours and a mean clearance of 7.3 L/hr. After administration of 14 C-posaconazole as oral suspension, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of the radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled dose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of  the radiolabelled dose excreted in urine (&lt; 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steadystate plasma concentrations are attained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose (once daily after twice daily loading dose at Day 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion single dose increased in a greater than dose proportional manner over the range of 50-200 mg; by comparison, dose-dependent increases were observed over a range of 200-300 mg.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

Based on a population pharmacokinetic model evaluating posaconazole pharmacokinetics, steady state posaconazole concentrations were predicted in patients administered posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion or tablets 300 mg once a day f ollowing BID dosing on Day 1 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections.

Table 8. Population predicted median (10 th percentile, 90 th percentile) posaconazole steady state plasma concentrations in patients f ollowing administration of posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion or tablets 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1)

| Tablet- (Fasted)                      | Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis | 1,780 (879; 3,540)   | 1,490 (663; 3,230) |
| Concentrate for Solution for Infusion | Prophylaxis                         | 1,890 (1,100; 3,150) | 1,500 (745; 2,660) |
| Concentrate for Solution for Infusion | Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis | 2,240 (1,230; 4,160) | 1,780 (874; 3,620) |

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole in patients suggests that race, sex, renal impairment and disease (prophylaxis or treatment) have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole.

## Children (&lt; 18 years)

There is limited (n=3) paediatric experience with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion in the study of treatment of invasive aspergillosis (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).

The mean pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple dose administration of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension in neutropenic paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age are shown in Table 9. Patients were enrolled into 2 age groups and received posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension doses at 6 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) once daily (twice daily on Day 1) (see section 5.1).

Table 9.

† Median (minimum-maximum)

‡ Clearance (CL for IV and CL/F for PFS)

Based on a population pharmacokinetic model evaluating posaconazole pharmacokinetics and predicting exposures in paediatric patients, the exposure target of  steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) of approximately 1,200 ng/mL and Cav ≥ 500 ng/mL in approximately 90 % of patients is attained with the recommended dose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. Simulations, using the population pharmacokinetic model, predict a Cav ≥ 500 ng/mL in 90% of paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg following administration of the adult dose of posaconazole gastro-resistant tablets (300 mg twice daily on Day 1 and 300 mg once daily starting on Day 2).

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole in paediatric patients suggests that age, sex, renal impairment and ethnicity have no clinically meaningf ul effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole.

## Gender

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole concentration for solution for infusion are comparable in men and women.

## Elderly

No overall differences in safety were observed between the geriatric patients and younger patients.

The population pharmacokinetic model of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablets indicates that posaconazole clearance is related to age. Posaconazole C av is generally comparable between young and elderly patients ( /uniF0B3 65 years of age); however, the Cav is increased by 11 % in the very elderly ( /uniF0B3 80 years). It is, theref ore, suggested to closely monitor very elderly patients (≥ 80 years) f or adverse events.

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion are comparable in young and elderly subjects ( /uniF0B3 65 years of age).

Pharmacokinetic differences based upon age are not to be considered clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment is required.

## Race

There is insuff icient data among dif ferent races with posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion.

There was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black subjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety prof ile of posaconazole between the Black and Caucasian subjects was similar.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight

The population pharmacokinetic model of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and tablets indicates that posaconazole clearance is related to weight. In patients &gt; 120 kg, the C av is decreased by 25 % and in patients &lt; 50 kg, the Cav is increased by 19 %. It is, theref ore, suggested to closely monitor f or breakthrough f ungal inf ections in patients weighing more than 120 kg.

## Renal impairment

Following single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild and moderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; therefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr &lt; 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [&gt; 96 % CV (coefficient of variance)] compared to other renal groups [&lt; 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not significantly renally eliminated, an ef fect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. Due to the variability in exposure, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections (see section 4.2).

Similar recommendations apply to posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion; however, a specific study has not been conducted with posaconazole concentrate for solution f or infusion.

## Hepatic impairment

After a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per group), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that there is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60 % increase in total AUC. The elimination half-life (t½) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in respective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment but caution is advised due to the potential f or higher plasma exposure.

Similar recommendations apply to posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion; however, a specific study has not been conducted with posaconazole concentrate for solution f or infusion.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

As observed with other azole antifungal agents, ef fects related to inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects were observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans.

Neuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for /uniF0B3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one year. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed on the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved therapeutically.

Pulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the 2-year study in rats. These f indings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for f unctional changes in humans.

No effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.9-fold greater than the concentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans with 300 mg intravenous infusion administration. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 2.2-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monkeys at systemic exposures 2.2-fold and 8.9-fold greater, respectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.

A non-dose related incidence of thrombus/emboli in the lung was seen in the 1 month repeated dose study in the monkey. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

Reproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and malformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability. In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered to be due to a treatment-related ef fect on steroidogenesis.

Posaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal special hazards for humans.

In a nonclinical study using intravenous administration of posaconazole in very young dogs (dosed from 2-8 weeks of age) an increase in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement was observed in treated animals as compared with concurrent control animals. No difference in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent 5-month treatment-free period. There were no neurologic, behavioural or developmental abnormalities in the dogs with this finding, and a similar brain f inding was not seen with either oral posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (4 days to 9 months of age) or intravenous posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (10 weeks to 23 weeks of age). The clinical signif icance of this finding is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Non-interchangeability between Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and Noxafil oral suspension

Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension is indicated for paediatric population (&lt;18 years old) only. Another formulation (Noxafil oral suspension) is available for adult patients ≥18 years old.

The gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension is not to be used interchangeably with oral suspension due to the dif ferences in the dosing of each formulation. Therefore, follow the specif ic dose recommendations for each of the formulations.

Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in the supportive care of  high-risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis.

## Posology

Noxafil is also available as 40 mg/mL oral suspension; 100 mg gastro-resistant tablet; and 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion.

Dosing for paediatric patients 2 years to less than 18 years of age is shown in Table 1.

The maximum dose volume that can be administered with a 10 mL dosing syringe is 8 mL using one marketed sachet of Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension, corresponding to a maximum dose of 240 mg (i.e., the recommended dose for patients weighing 40 kg). For paediatric patients weighing &gt; 40 kg, it is recommended to use posaconazole tablets if the patient can swallow whole tablets. Refer to the tablet SmPC for additional dosing information.

Table 1. Recommended dose in paediatric patients (2 years to less than 18 years of age) and weighing 10 to 40 kg

| Weight (kg)   | Dose (volume)   |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 10-<12 kg     | 90 mg (3 mL)    |
| 12-<17 kg     | 120 mg (4 mL)   |
| 17-<21 kg     | 150 mg (5 mL)   |
| 21-<26 kg     | 180 mg (6 mL)   |
| 26-<36 kg     | 210 mg (7 mL)   |
| 36-40 kg      | 240 mg (8 mL)   |

On Day 1, the recommended dose is administered twice.

After Day 1, the recommended dose is administered once daily.

## Duration of therapy

For patients with refractory invasive fungal infections (IFI) or patients with IFI intolerant to 1 st line therapy, the duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.

For patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections with Noxafil should start several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 500 cells per mm 3 . Duration of therapy is based on recovery from neutropenia or immunosuppression.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

An effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Limited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic liver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is necessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for higher plasma exposure.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole in children aged below 2 years have not been established. No clinical data are available.

## Method of administration

## For oral use

The dose should be administered orally within 30 minutes of mixing.

Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension must be administered with the provided notched tip syringes.

For details on preparation and administration of the gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension, see section 6.6 and Instructions for Use.

Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Co-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Co-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin (see section 4.5).

Co-administration during the initiation and dose-titration phase of venetoclax in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity

There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing posaconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.

## Hepatic toxicity

Hepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes have been reported.

Posaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical experience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Monitoring of hepatic function

Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during posaconazole therapy must be routinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver f unction tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with development of liver disease.

## QTc prolongation

Some azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Posaconazole must not be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as:

- Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation
- Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure
- Sinus bradycardia
- Existing symptomatic arrhythmias
- Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).

Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.

## Drug interactions

Posaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during treatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5).

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of posaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5).

## Vincristine toxicity

Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5).

## Venetoclax toxicity

Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors, including posaconazole, with the CYP3A4 substrate venetoclax, may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Refer to the venetoclax SmPC f or detailed guidance.

## Rifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), flucloxacillin, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz

Posaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.5).

## Plasma exposure

Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets are generally higher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. Posaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets may increase over time in some patients (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gastrointestinal dysfunction

There are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as severe diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections.

## Photosensitivity reaction

Posaconazole may cause increased risk of photosensitivity reaction. Patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure during treatment without adequate protection such as protective clothing and sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF).

## Methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate

This medicinal product contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate. May cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

## Sorbitol

This medicine contains 47 mg sorbitol (E420) per mL.

In medicinal products for oral use, sorbitol may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products for oral use administered concomitantly.

Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take/be given this medicinal product.

## Propylene glycol

This medicine contains 7 mg propylene glycol (E1520) per mL.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of other medicinal products on posaconazole

Posaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp) eff lux in vitro . Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rif ampicin, rif abutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.

## Rifabutin

Rifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the ef fect of posaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels.

## Flucloxacillin

Flucloxacillin (a CYP450 inducer) may decrease plasma posaconazole concentrations. Concomitant use of posaconazole and f lucloxacillin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.4).

## Efavirenz

Efavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## Fosamprenavir

Combining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the 1 st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2 nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21 % and 23 %, respectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with ritonavir is unknown.

## Phenytoin

Phenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.

## H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors

No clinically relevant effects were observed when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. No dose adjustment of posaconazole tablets is required when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors.

## Effects of posaconazole on other medicinal products

Posaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the effects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of the CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be associated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate and/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole occurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The effect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 substrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is expected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The eff ect of  co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be variable within a patient.

Terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates) Co-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).

## Ergot alkaloids

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot alkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin)

Posaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be discontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).

## Vinca alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of  CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.

## Rifabutin

Posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see also above regarding the ef fect of rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions related to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended.

## Sirolimus

Repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-f old and 8.9-fold (range 3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The eff ect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients is unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Co-administration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever possible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. Sirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly . It should be noted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during coadministration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the usual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that fall in the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid to clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.

## Ciclosporin

In heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once daily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin levels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of leukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with posaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. to about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose of ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary.

## Tacrolimus

Posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121 % and 358 %, respectively. Clinically signif icant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or posaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical eff icacy studies. When initiating posaconazole treatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to about one third of the current dose). Thereaf ter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of tacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary.

## HIV Protease inhibitors

As HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase plasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold), respectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-f old and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The addition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated with increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co-administration with posaconazole.

## Midazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4

In a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice daily f or 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg single oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg or 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 8-10 hours during co-administration.

Due to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered when posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4).

## Calcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine)

Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel blockers may be required.

## Digoxin

Administration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, posaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored when initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment.

## Sulfonylureas

Glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered with posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients.

## All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or tretinoin

As ATRA is metabolised by the hepatic CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, concomitant administration with posaconazole, which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, may lead to increased exposure to tretinoin resulting in an increased toxicity (especially hypercalcaemia). Serum calcium levels should be monitored and, if needed, appropriate dose adjustments of tretinoin should be considered during the treatment with posaconazole, and during the following days after treatment.

## Venetoclax

Compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone, co-administration of 300 mg posaconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days in 12 patients, increased venetoclax Cmax to 1.6-f old and 1.9-fold, and AUC to 1.9-f old and 2.4-fold, respectively (see sections

## 4.3 and 4.4).

Refer to the venetoclax SmPC.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is insuff icient inf ormation on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole must not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Posaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of posaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on initiation of treatment with posaconazole.

## Fertility

Posaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (3.4 times the 300-mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg (2.6 times the 300-mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients). There is no clinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Since certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with posaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be used.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Safety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension.

The safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in &gt; 2,400 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported serious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased bilirubin.

## Posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion safety

The safety of posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion has been assessed in 115 paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years f or prophylaxis use.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hepatobiliary disorders

During post-marketing surveillance of posaconazole oral suspension, severe hepatic injury with fatal outcome has been reported (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no experience with overdose of posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension.

During clinical studies, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day experienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. Accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice a day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.

Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of overdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered.

Posaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14α -demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis.

## Microbiology

Posaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the f ollowing microorganisms: Aspergillus species ( Aspergillus fumigatus , A. flavus , A. terreus , A. nidulans , A. niger , A. ustus ), Candida species ( Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis ), Coccidioides immitis , Fonsecaea pedrosoi , and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus. The microbiological data suggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor , Mucor , and Rhizopus; however, the clinical data are currently too limited to assess the eff icacy of posaconazole against these causative agents.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical signif icance is unknown. In a surveillance study of &gt; 3,000 clinical mold isolates from 2010-2018, 90 % of  nonAspergillus f ungi exhibited the following in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Mucorales spp (n=81) of 2 mg/L; Scedosporium apiospermum/S. boydii (n=65) of 2 mg/L; Exophiala dermatiditis (n=15) of 0.5 mg/L, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (n=21) of  1 mg/L.

## Resistance

Clinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle mechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for posaconazole and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimum-inhibitoryconcentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

## Combination with other antifungal agents

The use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or the other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will provide an added benefit.

## Clinical experience

## Summary of gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension and concentrate for solution for infusion bridging study

The pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastro-resistant powder and solvent f or oral suspension have been assessed in 115 paediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years in a nonrandomized, multi-center, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study (Study 097). Immunocompromised paediatric subjects with known or expected neutropenia were exposed to posaconazole at 3.5 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg daily (BID on Day 1). All 115 subjects initially received posaconazole concentrate for solution for inf usion for at least 7 days, and 63 subjects were transitioned to gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. The mean overall treatment duration (posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension) of all treated subjects was 20.6 days (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of posaconazole have been established in paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age. Use of posaconazole in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

well-controlled studies of posaconazole in adults, pharmacokinetic and safety data from paediatric studies, and by population pharmacokinetic modelling (see section 5.2). No new safety signals associated with the use of posaconazole in paediatric patients were identif ied in the paediatric studies (see section 4.8).

Safety and efficacy of Noxafil have not been established in paediatric patients below the age of 2 years.

No data are available.

## Electrocardiogram evaluation

Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12-hour period were obtained before and during administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from 173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of the gastro-resistant powder and solvent f or oral suspension is approximately 83 %. Administration of posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension following consumption of a high fat meal in adults had no significant ef fect on AUC and resulted in a moderate (23% to 41 %) decrease in Cmax. Based on a population pharmacokinetic model, no significant effect of a meal on posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension bioavailability was identified in paediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age. Therefore, the gastro-resistant powder and solvent f or oral suspension can be administered without regard to food.

Concomitant administration of posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension with medicinal products affecting gastric pH or gastric motility would not be expected to demonstrate any significant effects on posaconazole pharmacokinetic exposure based on similarity to the gastro-resistant tablets.

An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40 %) on the dissolution of Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. Posaconazole was found to release faster f rom Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension in the presence of alcohol in vitro , which may interfere with its delayed release characteristics.

## Distribution

Posaconazole has a central volume of distribution of 112 L (5.2 % RSE) based on population PK modelling in paediatric subjects receiving IV or PFS f ormulations. Posaconazole is highly protein bound (&gt; 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin.

## Biotransformation

Posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to be altered by inhibitors of  CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites observed. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % of  the administered radiolabelled dose.

## Elimination

Posaconazole is slowly eliminated with a mean clearance 4.7 L/h (3.9%RSE) and a corresponding to half-lif e (t½) of 24 hours based on population PK modelling in paediatric subjects receiving IV or PFS. After administration of 14 C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of the radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled dose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted in urine (&lt; 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state plasma

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations are attained by Day 7 after once daily dosing (twice daily on Day 1) in paediatric subject receiving PFS.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Children (&lt; 18 years)

Based on a population pharmacokinetic model evaluating posaconazole pharmacokinetics and predicting exposures in paediatric patients, the exposure target of  steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) of approximately 1,200 ng/mL and Cav ≥ 500 ng/mL in approximately 90 % of patients is attained with the recommended dose of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion and gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. Simulations, using the population pharmacokinetic model, predict a Cav ≥ 500 ng/mL in 90% of paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg following administration of the adult dose of posaconazole gastro-resistant tablets (300 mg twice daily on Day 1 and 300 mg once daily starting on Day 2).

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole in paediatric patients suggests that age, sex, renal impairment and ethnicity have no clinically meaningf ul effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole.

No dose adjustment is recommended in case of renal impairment (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

As observed with other azole antifungal agents, ef fects related to inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects were observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans.

Neuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for /uniF0B3 3 months at lower systemic exposures than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one year. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed on the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved therapeutically.

Pulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the 2-year study in rats. These f indings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for f unctional changes in humans.

In a nonclinical study using intravenous administration of posaconazole in very young dogs (dosed from 2-8 weeks of age) an increase in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement was observed in treated animals as compared with concurrent control animals. No difference in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent 5 month treatment-free period. There were no neurologic, behavioural or developmental abnormalities in the dogs with this finding, and a similar brain finding was not seen with either oral posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (4 days to 9 months of age) or intravenous posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs (10 weeks to 23 weeks of age). The clinical signif icance of this finding is unknown.

No effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.5-fold greater than the concentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 2.1-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 2.1-fold and 8.5-fold greater, respectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses.

Reproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower than those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and malformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic doses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered to be due to a treatment-related ef fect on steroidogenesis.

Posaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal special hazards for humans.

## 1. What Noxafil is and what it is used for

Noxafil contains a medicine called posaconazole. This belongs to a group of medicines called 'antif ungals'. It is used to prevent and treat many dif f erent f ungal inf ections.

This medicine works by killing or stopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause infections.

Noxafil can be used in adults to treat the f ollowing types of f ungal inf ections when other antifungal medicines have not worked or you have had to stop taking them:

- infections caused by fungi of the Aspergillus f amily that have not improved during treatment with the antifungal medicines amphotericin B or itraconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped;
- infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium f amily that have not improved during treatment with amphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped;
- infections caused by fungi that cause th e conditions known as 'chromoblastomycosis' and 'mycetoma' that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole has had to be stopped;
- infections caused by a fungus called Coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with one or more of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped;
- Inf ections in the mouth or throat area (known as 'thrush') caused by f ungi called Candida , which were not previously treated.

This medicine can also be used to prevent fungal infections in adults who are at high-risk of getting a fungal infection, such as:

- patients who have a weak immune system due to having chemotherapy f or 'acute myelogenous leuka emia' (AML) or 'myelodysplastic syndromes' (MDS)
- patients having 'high -dose immunosuppressive therapy' af ter 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant' (HSCT).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Noxafil

## Do not take Noxafil

- if  you are allergic to posaconazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if  you are taking: terf enadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine, quinidine, any medicines that contain 'ergot alkaloids' such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, or a 'statin' such as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin.
- if  you have just started taking venetoclax or your venetoclax dose is being slowly increased for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)

Do not take Noxafil if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Noxaf il.

See 'Other medicines and Noxafil' below f or more inf ormation including inf ormation on other medicines which may interact with Noxafil.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Noxafil if you:

- have had an allergic reaction to another antifungal medicine such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole.
- have or have ever had liver problems. You may need to have blood tests while you are taking this medicine.
- develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting, as these conditions may limit the effectiveness of this medicine.
- have an abnormal heart rhythm tracing (ECG) that shows a problem called long QTc interval
- have a weakness of the heart muscle or heart failure
- have a very slow heartbeat
- have heart rhythm disturbance
- have any problem with potassium, magnesium or calcium levels in your blood
- are taking vincristine, vinblastine and other 'vinca alkaloids' (medicines used to treat cancer)
- are taking venetoclax (a medicine used to treat cancer).

You should avoid sun exposure while being treated. It is important to cover sun exposed areas of skin with protective clothing and use sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), as an increased sensitivity of  skin to the sun's UV rays may occur .

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Noxafil.

If you develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting (being sick) while taking Noxafil, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away, as this may stop it from working properly. See section 4 f or more information.

## Children

Noxafil oral suspension should not be used in children and adolescents (17 years of age and younger).

## Other medicines and Noxafil

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Do not take Noxafil if you are taking any of the following:

- terfenadine (used to treat allergies)
- astemizole (used to treat allergies)
- cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)
- pimozide (used to treat symptoms of Tourette's and mental illness)
- halofantrine (used to treat malaria)
- quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Noxafil can increase the amount of these medicines in the blood which may lead to very serious changes to your heart rhythm.

- any medicines that contain 'ergot alkaloids' such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine used to treat migraines. Noxafil can increase the amount of these medicines in the blood which may lead to a severe decrease in blood flow to your fingers or toes and could cause damage to them.
- a 'statin' such as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin used to treat high cholesterol.
- venetoclax when used at the start of the treatment of a type of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)

Do not take Noxafil if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine.

## Other medicines

Look at the list of medicines given above that must not be taken while you are taking Noxafil. In addition to the medicines named above there are other medicines that carry a risk of rhythm problems that may be greater when they are taken with Noxafil. Please make sure you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking (prescribed or non-prescribed).

Certain medicines may increase the risk of side eff ects of Noxafil by increasing the amount of Noxafil in the blood.

The following medicines may decrease the effectiveness of Noxafil by decreasing the amount of Noxafil in the blood:

- rif abutin and rif ampicin (used to treat certain inf ections). If  you are already taking rif abutin, you will need a blood test and you will need to look out for some possible side ef fects of rif abutin.
- phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or primidone (used to treat or prevent fits).
- efavirenz and fosamprenavir used to treat HIV infection.
- flucloxacillin (antibiotic used against bacterial inf ections).
- medicines used to decrease stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine or omeprazole and similar medicines that are called proton pump inhibitors.

Noxafil may possibly increase the risk of side effects of some other medicines by increasing the amount of these medicines in the blood. These medicines include:

- vincristine, vinblastine and other 'vinca alkaloids' (used to treat cancer)
- venetoclax (used to treat cancer)
- ciclosporin (used during or after transplant surgery)
- tacrolimus and sirolimus (used during or after transplant surgery)
- rif abutin (used to treat certain inf ections)
- medicines used to treat HIV called protease inhibitors (including lopinavir and atazanavir, which are given with ritonavir)
- midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam or other 'benzodiazepines' (used as sedatives or muscle relaxants)
- diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipin e, nisoldipine or other 'calcium channel blockers' (used to treat high blood pressure)
- digoxin (used to treat heart f ailure)
- g lipizide or other 'sulf onylureas' (used to treat high blood sugar)
- all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), also called tretinoin (used to treat certain blood cancers).

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Noxafil.

## Noxafil with food and drink

## 3. How to take Noxafil

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will monitor your response and condition to determine how long Noxafil needs to be given and whether any change is needed to your daily dose.

The table below shows the recommended dose and length of treatment which depend on the type of infection that you have and may be individually adapted for you by your doctor. Do not adapt your dose yourself before consulting your doctor or change your treatment regime.

Whenever possible you should take posaconazole during or immediately after food or a nutritional drink.

## 1. What Noxafil is and what it is used for

Noxafil contains a medicine called posaconazole. This belongs to a group of medicines called 'antif ungals'. It is used to prevent and treat many dif f erent f ungal inf ections.

This medicine works by killing or stopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause infections.

Noxafil can be used in adults to treat f ungal infections caused by f ungi of the Aspergillus f amily.

Noxafil can be used in adults and children from 2 years of age weighing more than 40 kg to treat the following types of fungal infections:

- infections caused by fungi of the Aspergillus f amily that have not improved during treatment with the antifungal medicines amphotericin B or itraconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped;
- infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium f amily that have not improved during treatment with amphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped;
- inf ections caused by f ungi that cause the conditions known as 'chromoblastomycosis' and 'mycetoma' that have not improved during treatm ent with itraconazole or when itraconazole has had to be stopped;
- infections caused by a fungus called Coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with one or more of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped.

This medicine can also be used to prevent fungal infections in adults and children from 2 years of age weighing more than 40 kg who are at high-risk of getting a fungal infection, such as:

- patients who have a weak immune system due to having c hemotherapy for 'acute myelogenous leuka emia' (AML) or 'myelodysplastic syndromes' (MDS)
- patients having 'high -dose immunosuppressive therapy' af ter 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant' (HSCT).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Noxafil

## Do not take Noxafil

- if  you are allergic to posaconazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if  you are taking: terf enadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine, quinidine, any medicines that contain 'ergot alkaloids' such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, or a 'statin' such as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin.
- if  you have just started taking venetoclax or your venetoclax dose is being slowly increased for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)

Do not take Noxafil if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Noxafil.

See 'Other medicines and Noxafil' below f or more inf ormation including inf ormation on other medicines which may interact with Noxafil.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Noxafil if you:

- have had an allergic reaction to another antifungal medicine such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole.
- have or have ever had liver problems. You may need to have blood tests while you are taking this medicine.
- develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting, as these conditions may limit the effectiveness of this medicine.
- have an abnormal heart rhythm tracing (ECG) that shows a problem called long QTc interval
- have a weakness of the heart muscle or heart failure

You should avoid sun exposure while being treated. It is important to cover sun exposed areas of skin with protective clothing and use sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), as an increased sensitivity of  skin to the sun's UV rays may occur.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Noxafil.

If you develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting (being sick) while taking Noxafil, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away, as this may stop it from working properly. See section 4 f or more information.

## Children

Noxafil should not be given to children younger than 2 years of age.

## Other medicines and Noxafil

- cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)
- pimozide (used to treat symptoms of Tourette's and mental illness)

The following medicines may decrease the effectiveness of Noxafil by decreasing the amount of Noxafil in the blood:

- efavirenz and fosamprenavir used to treat HIV infection.
- flucloxacillin (antibiotic used against bacterial inf ections).

- venetoclax (used to treat cancer)
- ciclosporin (used during or after transplant surgery)

- infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium f amily that have not improved during treatment with amphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped;
- infections caused by f ungi that cause the conditions known as 'chromoblastomycosis' and 'mycetoma' that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole has had to be stopped;
- infections caused by a fungus called Coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with one or more of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had to be stopped.

This medicine can also be used to prevent fungal infections in children from 2 years of age who are at high-risk of getting a fungal infection, such as:

- patients who have a weak immune system due to having chemotherapy f or 'acute myelogenous leuka emia' (AML) or 'myelodysplastic syndromes' (MDS) .
