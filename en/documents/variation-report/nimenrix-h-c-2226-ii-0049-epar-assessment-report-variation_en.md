## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Nimenrix is a vaccine indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies are known to protect against meningococcal diseases via complement mediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies against capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, which are measured by assays using either rabbit complement (rSBA) or human complement (hSBA). Vaccine efficacy was inferred from the demonstration of immunologic non inferiority (based mainly on comparing proportions with rSBA titres at least 8) to licensed meningococcal vaccines.

This variation includes submission of the clinical study reports (CSR) on a randomised, open label, controlled, multicentre, primary vaccination study (MenACWY-TT-083) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 vs. 3 doses of Nimenrix in infants followed by a booster dose at the age of 12 months.

As background to this variation the initial application dossier for Nimenrix included studies to support use from 12 months of age. At that time the MAH (GSK) had only data on one vs. two doses for the age group 9 to 12 months in MenACWY-TT-055/062, in which infants aged 9 months received 2 doses (the second dose when they were ~12 months old) and those aged 12 months received a single dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One month after vaccination (i.e. at month 4 (M4) of study) in the single dose (ACWY-1) group, 79.5% and 94.6% had hSBA-MenA and C titres ≥ 1:8, respectively, compared to 50.8% for MenW and 56.1% for MenY. In the ACWY-2 group the post-dose 2 (i.e. M4) percentages with hSBA ≥ 1:8 were at least numerically higher at 88.4%, 100%, 99.3% and 99.3% for respective meningococcal serogroups. The M4 GMTs were lower for the ACWY-1 group vs. the ACWY-2 group. Even for MenA, with the least difference between one and two doses, the 95% CI did not overlap.

By month 12 (M12) of the study the percentages with hSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were 87.5%, 89.4% and 80.0% for MenC, MenW-135 and Men Y, respectively, in the ACWY-1 group. Higher percentages (91.2%, 99.1% and 92.5%, respectively) had such titres in the ACWY-2 group. In contrast, against MenA 20.6% ACWY-1 and 25.9% ACWY-2 subjects had hSBA titres ≥ 1:8. For MenA and MenC in the ACWY-1 group and for all meningococcal serogroups in the ACWY-2 group the hSBA GMTs decreased from M1 to M12. The ACWY-1 group showed increases in the GMTs for MenW (from 11 to 128) and Y (from 15 to 56). These hSBA data suggested a possible benefit for two doses when the first was given at 9 months.

The MAH has since completed a study (MenACWY-TT-083) that compares two doses of Nimenrix at 2 and 4 months of age with 3 doses at 2, 3 and 4 months of age in infancy, each followed by a single booster dose at 12 months of age. Two control groups are used (a MenC-CRM197 conjugate and a MenC-TT conjugate). In each group the meningococcal conjugate vaccines were co-administered with Infanrix hexa (DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T) and Synflorix (10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). Based on the results, the MAH proposes a 2+1 dose regimen starting from 6 weeks of age in this variation.

Some elements of the design of study MenACWY-TT-083 were discussed as part of the request for scientific advice from CHMP. In particular, the use of non-inferiority immune responses compared to licensed MencC conjugate vaccines was agreed, along with the immunological endpoints (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310864/2007). Study MenACWY-TT-083 is also part of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and its design was discussed in detail with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The most appropriate control vaccines were discussed and agreed during the initial PIP procedure.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The application is based on a single newly reported clinical study MenACWY-TT-083. This was an open label randomised and active controlled study in infants. It was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response to MenC elicited by Nimenrix (MenACWY-TT) when given intramuscularly at 2, 4 and 12 months of age or at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age compared to two licensed MenC conjugate vaccines (one CRM197 and one TT conjugate) given intramuscularly at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. The study was conducted between July 2010 and September 2013 at 44 centres in three countries (Estonia, Germany and Spain).

## GCP

The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study participants

The study population consisted of previously unvaccinated (except for neonatal HBV or BCG) healthy male and female infants aged between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) at the time of the first vaccination and born after a gestation period of at least 36 weeks. Infants were excluded if they had received &gt; 14 days in total of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth or had any other reason to have immunodeficiency. Non-study vaccinations were not allowed except for rotavirus and influenza vaccines (at any time) and MMR[V], which was allowed due to a measles outbreak that led to relaxing the initial plan to delay administration of MMR[V] until after Visit 6. Other exclusions were standard for infant vaccination studies, including state of health at each visit that could result in deferred dosing.

## Objectives

## Primary objectives

The following 6 co-primary objectives were assessed in a hierarchical manner in the following order:

1. To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) non-inferiority (5% NI margin) of the 3-dose schedule of MenACWY-TT vs. the 2-dose schedule of MenC-CRM197 (Menjugate) for percentages with rSBA-MenC ≥ 1:8.
2. To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) non-inferiority (5% NI margin) of the 3-dose schedule of MenACWY-TT vs. the 2-dose schedule of MenC-TT (NeisVac-C) for percentages with rSBA-MenC ≥ 1:8.
3. To demonstrate at 5 months of age (Visit 4) the immunogenicity of the 3-dose schedule for MenACWY-TT for MenA, W and Y based on rSBA ≥ 1:8 in at least 80%.

Objectives 4, 5 and 6 were the same as 1, 2 and 3 except that the comparisons were made for the 2-dose schedule of MenACWY-TT.

## Secondary objectives

These included comparisons of rSBA at different time points, hSBA titres as measured in subsets, immune responses to the antigens in Infanrix hexa (including the anti-poliovirus titres that were submitted during the procedure) and to Synflorix. These comparisons were based on the usual cut-off values except that there was a change in the pneumococcal assay so that data are reported for 0.15 μg/ml and 0.35 μg/ml cut-offs.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary outcome

- Immunogenicity with respect to components of the investigational vaccine:
-  rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for each of the four serogroups in all subjects, one month after the final priming vaccination.

## Secondary outcome

Immunogenicity:

- Immunogenicity with respect to components of the investigational vaccine (on secondary readouts):
-  rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 at pre-vaccination: in a randomised subset of 50% of subjects for each of the four serogroups in the investigational vaccine groups, and in a randomised subset of 50% and 25% of subjects for MenC and MenAWY, respectively, in the control groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 at pre-booster dose and one month post-booster dose, for each of the four serogroups in all subjects.
-  rSBA titres ≥ 1:128 and titres at pre-vaccination: in a randomised subset of 50% of subjects for each of the four serogroups in the investigational vaccine groups, and in a randomised subset of 50% and 25% of subjects for MenC and MenAWY, respectively, in the control groups.
-  rSBA titres ≥ 1:128 and titres one month after the final priming vaccination, at pre-booster dose and one month post-booster dose, for each of the four serogroups in all subjects.
-  hSBA titres ≥ 1:4, ≥ 1:8 and titres for each of the four serogroups, in a randomised subset of 50% of subjects at pre-vaccination, one month after the final priming vaccination, pre-booster dose and one month post-booster dose.
- Immunogenicity with respect to components of the co-administered pneumococcal vaccine.
-  Anti-pneumococcal antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 μg/ml (seropositivity), ≥ 0.35 μg/ml and concentrations in a randomised subset of 25% of subjects, at pre-vaccination, one month after the final priming vaccination, pre-booster dose and one month post-booster dose.
- Immunogenicity with respect to components of the co-administered DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine.
-  Antibody concentrations/titres for anti-diphtheria ( ≥ 0.1 IU/ml and concentrations), anti-tetanus ( ≥ 0.1 IU/ml and concentrations), anti-PT, anti- FHA, anti-PRN ( ≥ 5 EL.U/ml and concentrations), anti-HBs ( ≥ 10 mIU/ml, ≥ 100 mIU/ml and concentrations), anti-polio type 1, 2 and 3 ( ≥ 1:8 and titres), anti-PRP ( ≥ 0.15 μg/ml, ≥ 1.0 μg/ml and concentrations) antibodies in a randomised subset of 25% of subjects, at pre-vaccination, one month after the final priming vaccination, pre-booster and one month post-booster dose.

## Sample size

The target sample size was 1650 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity (412 per vaccine group). Assuming ~20% might have withdrawn or not been evaluable for immunogenicity, the target sample size was 2060 (515 per vaccine group).

## Treatment and Randomisation

The randomisation of subjects to vaccine group was performed at GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, using MATEX. Subjects were allocated using GSK's SBIR system. A randomisation block scheme was used to ensure that correct balance between treatments was maintained. The randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre. Treatments were as follows for the four groups:

Immunological parameters used to interpret immune responses

1. Functional anti-meningococcal activity was determined by a serum bactericidal test according to the CDC protocol [Maslanka, 1997] using baby rabbit complement. Using human complement, hSBA titres  of  at  least  1:4  broadly  correlate  with  protection  against  invasive  meningococcal disease due to serogroup C [Goldschneider 1969]. This same cut-off has been proposed to apply to serogroups A and B. Bactericidal antibody titres measured using baby rabbit complement are higher than those measured using human complement. Based on UK data, rSBA titres against MenC of at least 1:8 have been proposed to correlate with short-term protection [Andrews, 2003; Borrow, 2005]. However, rSBA titres of 1:128 also correlate well with hSBA titres 1:4 for MenC and a rSBA titre of 1:168 has been regarded as a more conservative correlate of protection than 1:8. Therefore, the MAH presented percentages reaching rSBA titres at least 1:8 and at least 1:128.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Functional anti-meningococcal activity was also determined by a serum bactericidal test using human complement (hSBA). Percentages  reaching  titres  at  least  1:4  and  at  least  1:8  were presented.
3. Specific antibodies against DT (anti-D) and TT (anti-TT) were measured by an ELISA developed in-house or a multiplex immuno-assay (Luminex) developed in-house. The cut-off of the tests was set at 0.1 IU/ml [Camargo, 1984; Melville-Smith, 1983]. Antibody concentrations greater than or equal to this value were considered as protective. In subjects with post-vaccination anti-D concentration &lt;0.1 IU/ml, thepost-vaccination serum samples was to be retested using a Vero cell neutralisation test [Miyamura, 1974a; Miyamura, 1974b]. The cut-off of the Vero-cell assay was 0.016 IU/ml.
4. Antibodies  against  the  pertussis  components  PT,  FHA  and  PRN  were  measured  by  an  ELISA technique developed in-house or a multiplex immuno-assay (Luminex) developed in-house. The cut-off for all three pertussis antibodies was 5 EL.U/ml. Subjects with antibody concentration below this cut-off were considered seronegative. No correlate of protection is defined for the immune response to pertussis antigens [Granstrom, 1987; Kaprinski, 1987].
5. Antibodies to HBs antigen were measured by a CLIA developed in-house. Antibody concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml were considered protective [CDC, 1991 and WHO, 2009]. There was a change in the Hepatitis B assay at the time of testing. Antibodies to HBsAg were measured using CLIA with a cut-off of 6.2 mIU/ml.
6. Antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were determined by a virus microneutralisation test adapted from the WHO Guidelines for WHO/EPI Collaborative Studies on Poliomyelitis [WHO, 1993]. The lowest dilution at which serum samples are to be tested is 1:8, from which a test is considered positive. Titres will be expressed in terms of the reverse of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. Antibody titres greater than or equal 1:8 are considered as protective.
7. Total antibodies against the Hib polysaccharide PRP were measured by an ELISA or multiplex developed in-house. The cut-off of the test was 0.15 μg/ml. Antibody concentrations greater than or equal to this value were considered as protective [Makela 1977].
8. Pneumococcal serotype specific total IgG antibodies (antibodies to 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) were each measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA [Concepcion, 2001]. The antibody concentration was determined by logistic log comparison of the ELISA curves with a standard reference serum 89-SF available from the US FDA for which concentration of IgG and IgM to the 10 serotypes are known in μg/ml [Quataert, 1995]. The cut-off of the assay was 0.15 μg/ml.

One extra dose of the most appropriate licensed vaccine was offered to subjects presenting with any of the following at the post-booster vaccination time point:

- anti-PRP antibody concentration &lt; 0.15 μg/ml,
- rSBA-MenC antibody titre &lt; 1:8,
- anti-D or anti-TT antibody concentration &lt; 0.1 IU/ml,
- anti-PT, anti-FHA or anti-PRN antibody concentration &lt; 5 EL.U/ml,
- anti-HBs antibody concentration &lt; 10 mIU/ml,
- anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 or 3 antibody titres &lt; 1:8.

As no immunological correlate of protection had been defined for pneumococcal serotypes, no extra dose of a pneumococcal vaccine was to be offered.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open study. However, the laboratory in charge of testing was blinded to treatment assignment. Codes were used to link the subject and study to each sample.

## Statistical methods

The co-primary objectives (1-6 as stated above) were to be assessed in a hierarchical manner. A co-primary objective could only be met if the statistical criterion for that objective was met as well as the statistical criteria for all previous co-primary objectives. For this reason, the multiplicity of objectives did not require an alpha adjustment. However, it impacted the beta parameter as Objective 6 could only be reached if all six objectives were met simultaneously. The global power to meet all primary objectives considering a sample size of 412 evaluable subjects per group was at least 82.3%.

## Analysis sets

- The Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort included all vaccinated subjects during the primary phase.
- The Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort for Immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects from the primary phase with immunogenicity data.
- The Primary ATP cohort for safety included all vaccinated subjects who met the selection criteria
- The Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects from the Primary ATP cohort for safety who did not receive forbidden medications, had no medical condition which might have influenced the immune response, complied with the vaccination schedule for Visits 1, 2 and 3 and the blood sample schedule for Visit 4.
- The Booster Total Vaccinated cohort included all subjects who received a booster dose at Visit 5.
- The Booster Total Vaccinated cohort for immunogenicity included all who received a booster dose with post-booster immunogenicity data.
- The Booster ATP cohorts for safety and immunogenicity were defined as for the primary cohorts with addition of having a blood sample from Visit 6. The interval between the Visit 5 and 6 blood samples was to be 21 to 48 days.

The primary analyses of immunogenicity were based on the defined ATP immunogenicity cohorts.

All CI computed were two-sided 95% CI. The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group were calculated based on the method by Clopper. The standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference in proportions were based on the method of Newcombe [1998].

The 95% CIs for GMTs/GMCs were obtained within each group separately. The 95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titre/concentration was first obtained assuming that log-transformed values were normally distributed with unknown variance. The 95% CI for the GMTs/GMCs were then obtained by exponential transformation of the 95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titre/concentration. The 95% CIs of the group GMC/GMT ratios were computed using an ANOVA model on the log10 transformation of the concentrations/titres. The ANOVA model included the vaccine group as fixed effect.

The final analysis was performed on the data collected up to one month after the booster vaccine dose (administered at Visit 5) and used cleaned data.

## 2.4.1.1. Results

## Recruitment, Conduct of the study and numbers analysed

The first subject was enrolled on 01 July 2010 and the last study visit was on 10 September 2013.

There were 3 amendments to the original protocol dated 27 January 2010:

- Amendment 1 (06 December 2010) included some administrative changes.
- Amendment 2 (25 May 2011) increased the sample size by approximately 50% so that 680 additional subjects were to be enrolled to reach 1650 evaluable subjects. Testing for S. pneumoniae OPA was removed.
- Amendment 3 (30 July 2012) allowed administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine throughout the study to address a measles outbreak in Spain.

Most (1559) of the 2095 subjects were enrolled in Spain, followed by 502 in Germany and 34 in Estonia. Of these, 2042 subjects completed the primary phase and 1841 were included in the primary ATP immunogenicity cohort. Most of the exclusions were due to missing immunogenicity data (148) or due to lack of adherence to the vaccination (41) or sampling (25) schedules. The mean age of the subjects in the primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks (range 6 to 12 weeks; median 9 weeks) with an equal gender split.

A total of 2017 subjects received a booster vaccination of which 2006 completed the booster phase, 1995 completed the study and 1815 were included in the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity. The mean age of the subjects in the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 12.1 months (range 12 to 13 months).

## Baseline data

## Primary vaccination phase

Across all vaccine groups, the mean age of the subjects at the first vaccination in the primary TVC was 8.6 weeks (standard deviation [SD] ±1.5). The distribution of males and females was similar, with 50.2% male and 49.8% female. By race, the majority of subjects were of White Caucasian/European heritage (94.4%).

## Booster phase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across all vaccine groups, the mean age of the subjects at the time of booster vaccination in the booster TVC was 12.1 months (SD ±0.4). The distribution of males and females was similar, with 50.1% male and 49.9% female. By race, the majority of subjects were of White Caucasian/European heritage (94.5%).

## Outcomes and estimation

Immune responses to meningococcal polysaccharides

In accordance with the pre-defined criteria, non-inferiority of the 3-dose schedule of MenACWY-TT was demonstrated vs. MenC-CRM and MenC-TT.

<!-- image -->

The lower confidence interval limits around the percentages with rSBA titres ≥1:8 in the ACWY\\_3 group were &gt;80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages in the 3-dose group with titres ≥1:128 except for MenY (76.6%).

Except for MenA, the GMTs were numerically lower for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT. GMTs for MenC were significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the MenC-CRM197 and MenC-TT groups as well as vs. the MenACWY-TT 2-dose group (95% CI did not overlap).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 3. Number and percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY antibody titre equal or above 1:8 and 1:128 and GMTs (primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

<!-- image -->

PIII(M3): time point for blood sampling one month after the primary vaccination

Non-inferiority  of  the  2-dose  schedule  of  MenACWY-TT  was  demonstrated  vs.  MenC-CRM197  and MenC-TT and the lower confidence interval limits for percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were &gt;80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages in the 2-dose group with titres ≥1:128 except for MenA (78.2%). The MenC GMT was significantly lower for the 2-dose MenACWY-TT group vs. the monovalent MenC vaccines (95% CI did not overlap).

<!-- image -->

Further exploration of the rSBA MenC GMTs indicated that the 95% CI around the GMTs for the MenACWY-TT 2-dose and 3-dose groups vs. the monovalent MenC conjugate vaccines all fell below 0.80 and, except for 2 doses vs. MenC-CRM197, were ≤ 0.60.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results by country suggested lower responses in Estonia based on percentages with ≥ 1:128 and GMTs but there were very few subjects so such comparisons are not robust.

The hSBA titres are summarised below and demonstrate a very similar pattern of between-group comparisons as described for the rSBA data.

Table 4. Number and percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY antibody titre equal to or above 1:4 and 1:8 and GMTs (primary cohort for immunogenicity)

<!-- image -->

The percentages with MenC hSBA titres ≥ 1:4 and 1:8 were comparable between each MenACWY-TT and monovalent MenC conjugate groups with lower 95% CI around the differences all within -4%. The comparisons of GMTs showed upper 95% CI that fell below 0.7 and, except for the 2-dose group vs. MenC-TT, below 0.6.

Before and after the booster dose, the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose group with non-overlapping 95% CI.

Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar proportions with pre- and post-boost titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI within -4%. GMTs were similar for the two MenACWY-TT and MenC-CRM197 groups but lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not overlap. The post-boost results were similar for Spain and Germany.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 5. Number and percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 or rSBA-MenY antibody titre equal or above 1:8 and 1:128 and GMTs (booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The pre- and post-boost hSBA data showed comparable titres between the MenACWY-TT 2-dose and 3-dose groups. The GMTs for MenW and MenY were higher in the 2-dose group but the 95% CI overlapped (only just for MenW). For MenC the GMTs were higher in the two monovalent groups but the 95% CI overlapped for all between-group comparisons.

The comparisons of percentages with hSBA titres ≥1:4 and ≥1:8 gave lower 95% CI within 3%.

Immune responses to co-administered antigens

## Anti-D and anti-TT antibody concentrations

After the primary series:

- All subjects had anti-D and anti-TT ≥0.1 IU/ml.
- The percentage with anti-D ≥1.0 IU/ml and the anti-D GMT were highest in the MenC-CRM197 group but at least 84% per group reached this titre.
- The percentage with anti-TT ≥1.0 IU/ml and the anti-T GMT were highest in the MenC-TT group but at least 95% reached this titre.

Pre-booster:

- At least 86% retained anti-D ≥ 0.1 IU/ml (97.5% in the MenC-CRM197 group) but the percentages with ≥ 1.0 IU/ml were from 6.1% (ACWY\\_3) to 21.0% (MenC-CRM197).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- At least 99% per group had anti-TT ≥ 0.1 IU/ml while 30.3% (MenC-CRM197 group) to 47.0% (MenC-TT group) had ≥ 1.0 IU/ml.

Post-booster:

- All subjects had anti-D and anti-TT ≥ 0.1 IU/ml.
- Percentages with anti-D ≥ 1.0 IU/ml ranged from 94.6% (ACWY\\_2) to 100% (MenC-CRM197) and the highest GMC was in the MenC-CRM197 group.
- Percentages with anti-TT ≥ 1.0 IU/ml were at least 99% per group and the highest GMT was observed for the MenC-TT group.

## Responses to pertussis antigens

In the absence of any established ICP, the analysis was based on percentages with anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody concentrations ≥ 5 EL.U/ml, the percentages classified as responders and the GMCs. These were broadly comparable between the four vaccine groups at each time point and are summarised by the figures below.

## Responses to Hib antigens

Differences in the anti-PRP responses emerged for percentages with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 μ g/ml and the GMCs, such that the lowest response was seen in the MenC-CRM197 group after the primary doses.

## Responses to IPV antigens

It should be noted that all subjects received both IPV and a meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Therefore the only comparisons that can be made are with respect to any differences for the Nimenrix groups and the monovalent groups with respect to immune responses to the IPV contained in Infanrix hexa.

Bearing in mind this limitation, the relevant tables comparing 2-dose and 3-dose Nimenrix groups with the monovalent MenC groups are shown below for the post-primary time point. These tables demonstrate no disadvantages for the Nimenrix groups in terms of percentages reaching titres 1:8 to any of the 3 polioviruses. After the booster dose all subjects in all vaccine groups who were tested had titres of at least 1:8 for each poliovirus (data not shown).

After the booster dose all GMTs exceeded 900 and all except the GMT in the 3-dose Nimenrix group for poliovirus 1 exceeded 1000. The GMTs were higher in the monovalent MenC groups with the exception of the response to poliovirus 3 in the Nimenrix 2-dose group, which was higher than values in either monovalent MenC group. However, since there was a very clear and profound anamnestic response to IPV in all groups it is not at all likely that the differences observed are clinically important.

## Responses to Synflorix

After the primary series the percentages with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.35 µg/mL was at least 74.0% for all groups and all serotypes. The lowest GMC observed was 0.7 μ g/ml (serotype 5 in the ACWY2 group) and the highest was 8.51 μ g/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As shown in the table below, antibody concentrations for individual serotypes were generally comparable across the four treatment groups.

Prior to the booster dose there were considerable differences in antibody concentrations between serotypes but, within each serotype, there were no major differences between treatment groups. After the booster dose concentrations ≥ 0.35 µg/mL were observed for at least 91.1% of subjects against each serotype. The lowest GMC was 0.84 μg/ml (serotype 5 in the MenC-TT group) and the highest was 9.75 μg/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As before, the antibody concentrations for individual serotypes were broadly similar across the four treatment groups.

## Total vaccinated cohort analysis

Since the percentage of subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohorts (primary and booster phases) was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohorts (TVC) was performed. The exploratory and descriptive results for immunogenicity for the Total Vaccinated Cohorts were consistent with the results for the ATP immunogenicity cohorts for both the primary and booster phases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The TVC data has been reflected in the SmPC table 2 section 5.1:

## 2.4.1.2. Additional data

Data related to the age of the indication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH seeks approval from 6 weeks of age, however the mean age of the subjects in the primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks and the median was 9 weeks and infants had to have been born after at least 36 weeks gestation. The MAH was therefore requested during the procedure to present the numbers of infants who were actually 6-8 weeks old at the time of the first dose and to provide the immune responses to meningococcal antigens for those aged &lt;8 weeks and &gt;8 weeks at enrolment.

The protocol stipulated that eligible subjects were to be between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) old at the time of the first vaccination. The demographic characteristics of infants aged 6 to 8 weeks and &gt;8 weeks at the time of first dose for the primary analysis according to protocol (ATP) cohort showed that overall the distribution of infants between the two age groups was balanced, with 869 infants (47.2%) 6 to 8 weeks of age and 972 infants (52.8%) &gt;8 weeks of age. Similar female:male distributions were seen in the ≤ 8 weeks group (433 females and 436 males; 49.8% and 50.2%, respectively) and the &gt;8 weeks group (479 females and 493 males; 49.3% and 50.7%, respectively).  These similar distributions for infants 6 to 8 weeks and &gt;8 weeks are seen in each of the vaccine groups.

At the 1-month post-primary vaccination series time point (1 month after the last priming dose [PIII(M3)] in Table 14), in both the 2-dose and the 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups, the percentage of subjects achieving rSBA titres of ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the &gt;8 weeks age groups for all meningococcal serogroups (Table 14).

At the same time point and for the 2-dose and 3-dose regimens, the percentage of subjects achieving hSBA titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the &gt;8 weeks age groups for all serogroups (not shown in this report).

There are some instances for rSBA suggesting slightly lower responses in the younger cohort but these become apparent only at the upper titre cut-off. This pattern was not seen with the hSBA data.

## Assay performance

During the procedure the MAH was asked to discuss changes in sensitivity with the rSBA and hSBA used in the initial Nimenrix application and the assays used in this extension of indication (assay results were higher with rSBA vs. hSBA in the MAA but the opposite was seen in the current application). The MAH clarified that for post-licensure studies (including Study MenACWY-TT-083) the Company switched from the GSK rSBA to the Public Health England (PHE) rSBA assay at the end of 2011. The GSK and PHE rSBA assays have different levels of sensitivity. Titres measured with the PHE rSBA are generally lower than those obtained with the GSK assays used at the time of licensure of Nimenrix. This is especially true for pre vaccination (baseline) sera.

It was clarified that there were no changes in assay procedure or conditions during testing, except for routine changes in qualified lots of complement and bacteria to replace lots that became consumed. Assay performance during the testing of serum samples from Study MenACWY-TT-083 was monitored routinely via quality control sample (QCS) titres, which did not reveal a shift or drift in assay performance over the period spanning MenACWY-TT-083 testing. Based on the data submitted using either assay it is clear that there is a marked immune response to Nimenrix, that it is not substantially improved by giving 3 vs. 2 doses, that immune responses to MenA, W-135 and Y are much higher in the Nimenrix group, whilst GMTs for MenC are higher with the monovalent vaccines.

Additionally the MAH was also asked to provide rSBA and hSBA assay performance data generated at PHE and GSK, respectively, during the testing of sera from studies submitted with the initial MAA. These data did not indicate any shifts in sensitivity of either assay.

## Data on GMTs for Meningococcal serogroup C in Nimenrix vs. control groups

It was observed that one month post-primary vaccination rSBA-MenC and hSBA MenC geometric mean titres (GMTs) are lower in the MenACWY-TT groups compared to the control vaccines. The clinical significance of this difference in GMTs is not known. The clinically relevant endpoint is rather the percentage of subjects with MenC titers equal to or above the seroprotective level (&gt;1:8) one month post primary vaccination.

As can be seen in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC and hSBA-MenC titers &gt;1:8 one month after the primary vaccination [time point PIII(M3)] are similar between MenACWY-TT and the control vaccines (&gt;98.6% of subjects with titres &gt;1:8 for rSBA and hSBA). The same holds true for both the pre-booster and post-booster time points [PIII(M10) and PIV(M11) in Table 5 and Table 6. This observation suggests that the protection against MenC provided by MenACWY-TT can be expected to be similar to that provided by both Menjugate and NeisVac-C in infants and toddlers.

Using the PHE assay, prior evaluations using MenC serological data and vaccine effectiveness data support the utility of looking at percentages with titres at least 1:8 but also at percentages reaching higher thresholds (e.g. at least 1:64 post-primary). Nevertheless, the reverse cumulative distribution curves for post-primary rSBA and hSBA titres (shown below) do not diverge (i.e. in that no group falls below 90% reaching that threshold) until titres higher than ~128-256. These curves support a conclusion that the differences in GMTs are not very likely to have clinical significance.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The study was of adequate design and conduct. It was of necessity open label but the primary endpoints are laboratory readouts and these were produced by staff unaware of the treatment assignment. Given the age of the subjects and volumes of blood needed, it is acceptable that assays were conducted in randomly selected subsets.

Although enrolment was predominant in Spain, the data by country indicated comparable patterns of responses between Spain and Germany. There are too few subjects from Estonia to comment. In accordance with the countries that participated in the study, in which there has not been widespread vaccination of women now of child-bearing age against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W or Y, the pre-vaccination titres in infants were very low. In the UK, where there was a large catch-up programme at the time of introduction of MenC vaccination, a substantial proportion of women now giving birth may have been primed with a MenC conjugate. Nevertheless, their circulating antibody is likely to be low, so that infant levels are not expected to be at a level that could interfere with the infant immune response.

## Minimum age for use

The MAH seeks approval from 6 weeks of age. The mean age of the subjects in the primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks and the median was 9 weeks and infants had to have been born after at least 36 weeks gestation. The demographic characteristics of infants aged 6 to 8 weeks and &gt;8 weeks at the time of first dose for the primary analysis according to protocol (ATP) cohort showed that overall the distribution of infants between the two age groups was balanced, with 869 infants (47.2%) 6 to 8 weeks of age and 972 infants (52.8%) &gt;8 weeks of age. At 1-month after the last priming dose [PIII(M3)] in Table 14), in both the 2-dose and the 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups, the percentage of subjects achieving rSBA titres of ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 were similar between the 6 to 8 weeks and the &gt;8 weeks age groups for all meningococcal serogroups (similar results with hSBA at titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8).

The data indicate a good spread of ages and the rSBA and hSBA results support the use of 2 doses even in infants aged 6-&lt; 8 weeks at the time of the first dose.

## Immune responses to meningococcal polysaccharides

This study met all six of the pre-defined elements of the primary analysis, which was conducted in a hierarchical fashion. It is noted that the comparisons of percentages achieving the pre-defined titres were based on a non-inferiority margin of 5% in each case. In light of the anticipated high titres and the life-threatening nature of the disease to be prevented, this margin is acceptable. In the primary series the rSBA data indicated at least comparable responses to MenC between either 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY-TT and the two monovalent MenC conjugates. In addition, the data showed that the lower bounds of the 95% CI around the differences in percentages with MenC rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were actually within -4%.

Only at the higher cut-offs, reflecting the differences in GMTs, was there a possible advantage for the monovalent MenC vaccines. Even then, &gt;90% in the MenACWY groups had rSBA titres ≥ 1:128. Some of the findings suggested that 2 doses of MenACWY might actually be better than 3 doses. For example,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rSBA GMTs for MenC were significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the other three groups (95% CI did not overlap).

In addition, the rSBA responses to MenA, W and Y did not suggest an advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT. In each case very high percentages in both groups had rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 at M3 of the study (i.e. at about 5 months of age). The lower confidence interval limits around the percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 were &gt;80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages with titres ≥ 1:128 except for MenY in the 3-dose group (76.6%) and MenA in the 2-dose group (78.2%).

Although the study was not powered for the comparison of hSBA data (as measured by GSK) between groups, there was a very similar pattern of between-group comparisons as described for the rSBA data (as measured by PHE) for each meningococcal serogroup at M3 of the study. The hSBA data demonstrated a greater advantage for 2 vs. 3 doses of MenACWY-TT than the rSBA data.

The hSBA titres at M3 also showed that the advantage of monovalent MenC conjugates was evident only at the upper titre cut-offs, again reflecting the GMTs. As for the rSBA data, it seems unlikely that the differences observed are clinically important given that &gt; 90% who received MenACWY-TT had hSBA titres ≥ 1:8.

Before and after the booster dose the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose group with non-overlapping 95% CI. Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar proportions with pre- and post-boost titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI within -4%.

The post-boost GMTs for MenC rSBA were similar for the two MenACWY-TT and MenC-CRM197 groups but lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not overlap. In the two MenACWY-TT groups all post-boost GMTs were higher than the post-primary GMTs, supporting the existence of anamnestic responses to the final dose.

The pre- and post-boost hSBA data showed a comparable pattern of post-boost responses vs. rSBA and further demonstrated anamnestic immune responses to the final dose of MenACWY-TT.

## Immune responses to co-administered antigens

In the CHMP scientific advice of 2013 the MAH (GSK) asked about omitting documentation of immune responses to co-administered vaccines. The MAH was advised that in the absence of such data the SmPC would have to carefully clarify that all information on co-administration came from subjects at least 12 months old. Therefore, although lack of such data would not per se preclude an approval for use of Nimenrix in infancy, it would likely severely limit the use of the vaccine at routine immunisation programme visits.

In response, the MAH decided to conduct assays of immune responses to co-administered antigens. Since this was performed for a representative sample from each treatment group, the data allow for an assessment of any impact of MenACWY-TT compared to MenC-CRM197 or MenC-TT. In addition, since all the data on immune responses to meningococcal antigens were obtained against the same background of co-administered vaccines, concluding that responses to MenACWY-TT are satisfactory automatically implies that it may be given with DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T and with Synflorix. Such data cannot be used to support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with PRP-CRM197 or PRP-D constructs or with Prevenar13 in infancy. With regard to the actual immune responses to co-administered antigens:

- The post-primary and post-boost anti-D and anti-TT antibody concentrations were satisfactory and GMCs showed the expected effects of the conjugates co-administered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Whilst there is no ICP applicable to pertussis there were no marked differences in antibody to PT, FHA or PRN between treatment groups.
- The post-primary antibody results demonstrate no disadvantages for the Nimenrix groups in terms of percentages reaching titres 1:8 to any of the 3 polioviruses. After the booster dose all subjects in all vaccine groups who were tested had titres of at least 1:8 for each poliovirus. Antibody concentrations data showed no major differences.
- There were no important differences between the four treatment groups for the post-primary, pre-boost or post-boost anti-HBsAg antibody concentrations.
- Differences in the anti-PRP responses emerged for percentages with anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥ 1.0 μ g/ml and the GMCs such that the lowest response was seen in the MenC-CRM197 group after the primary doses. This effect of the type of MenC conjugate has been noted before in studies in which PRP-T has been given to young infants with different MenC conjugates. However, this pattern disappeared after the booster dose when GMCs were numerically lower for the MenACWY-TT groups but almost all subjects achieved ≥ 1.0 μ g/ml anti-PRP concentration.
- Responses to Synflorix, in which 8/10 serotypes are conjugated to Protein D, one to DT (19F) and one to TT (18C), showed the expected variability in immune responses by serotype. The lowest post-primary responses were to serotypes 5 and 6B and the highest to serotype 14. However, for each serotype there were no marked differences in responses between the four treatment groups. There were no OPA data generated so it is not known whether the serotype-specific difference noted in older children (see the SmPC) would also occur in infancy. After the booster dose, concentrations ≥ 0.35 µg/mL were observed for at least 91.1% of subjects against each serotype. The lowest GMC was 0.84 μ g/ml (serotype 5 in the MenC-TT group) and the highest was 9.75 μ g/ml (serotype 14 in the MenC-CRM197 group). As before, the antibody concentrations for individual serotypes were broadly similar across the four treatment groups.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

In summary, the data support use of Nimenrix from 6 weeks of age.

There is no advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT in infants and the 2-dose regimen, with at least 8 weeks between doses, is acceptable. Experience has already demonstrated that a booster dose of MenC is needed. It is very reasonable to assume that this also applies to the other meningococcal serogroups. Immune responses at M12 are clearly anamnestic and can be expected to prolong protection. As in older age groups, for whom a single dose is currently recommended, the need for further doses later in life is not yet fully established. However, long term antibody persistence data for MenC suggest that there could be a benefit from an additional dose(s) after several years have elapsed. This may apply particularly to those who were at the younger end of the age range (e.g. &lt; 5 years old) when first vaccinated. For the present, the SmPC should recommend a booster dose of Nimenrix at 12 months of age.

In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Prior to this variation, the safety profile of Nimenrix in the existing indication was based on a pooled analysis on 9,621 subjects who have been vaccinated with one dose of Nimenrix in clinical studies. This

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pooled analysis includes data for 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 5 years of age, 990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and 2,326 adults (18 to 55 years).

In all age groups the most frequently reported local adverse reactions after vaccination were pain (24.1% to 41.3%), redness (15.5% to 35.6%) and swelling (11.3% to 19.9%).

In the 12-23 months and 2-5 years age groups, the most frequently reported general adverse reactions after vaccination were irritability (44.0% and 9.2% respectively), drowsiness (34.1% and 10.8% respectively), loss of appetite (26.6% and 8.2% respectively) and fever (17.1% and 8.1% respectively). In the 12-14 months age group who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given 2 months apart, the first and second doses were associated with similar local and systemic reactogenicity.

In the 6-10, 11-17 and ≥ 18 years age groups, the most frequently reported general adverse reactions after vaccination were headache (15.7%, 22.0% and 21.5% respectively), fatigue (15.6%, 21.9% and 20.7% respectively), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.3%, 9.4% and 8.3% respectively) and fever (8.0%, 5.3% and 4.9% respectively).

In a separate study a single dose of Nimenrix was administered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and older. All adverse reactions reported in this study were already observed in younger age groups.

## Study MenACWY-TT-083

See the description of the study design in section 2.4.1. The collection and analysis of the safety data, including the solicited symptoms collected and the grading of AEs, was in accordance with all other vaccine studies conducted by GSK in this age group.

## Patient exposure

A total of 2095 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in the study, of which 1052 subjects received at least 1 dose of MenACWY-TT (Table 16); 2017 subjects received a booster vaccination, of which 1008 subjects received MenACWY-TT. Overall, 3601 doses of MenACWY-TT were administered.

The study groups were balanced in terms of demographic characteristics (see section 2.4.1). In the primary TVC, the mean age at the first vaccination dose was 8.6 weeks, the ratio of female/male showed a good balance and was close to 1 (0.99), and the majority of subjects were from White - Caucasian / European heritage (94.4%).

## Adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AEs in the primary phase

In the primary phase of the study at least 96.8% of subjects in each treatment group received all their assigned doses of study vaccines.

During the 8-day follow-up period, almost all subjects had at least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited; most of which occurred within 4 days and were considered to be vaccine-related) and about one third had at least one Grade 3 symptom. Reporting rates were similar or slightly lower with sequential doses.

Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in all four groups during the 8-day post-vaccination period followed by pain and swelling.

(from table 370 - Module 5.3.5.1 study report body)

The data shown by individual vaccine indicated that the meningococcal vaccine sites were least likely to be associated with local symptoms and the Infanrix hexa sites were more likely than the Synflorix sites to be associated with redness and selling.

Irritability was the most frequently reported (in &gt;80% of subjects) solicited general symptom in all four groups during the 8-day post-vaccination period. Grade 3 irritability was reported in about one fifth. Next common was drowsiness followed by loss of appetite. Generally the trend was to slightly lower reporting rates with sequential doses. Low grade fever was very common. Fever &gt;39 0 C was common, although &lt;1% had fever &gt;40 0 C. The pattern did not indicate that higher rates of general symptoms occurred with MenACWY-TT compared to the two monovalent MenC groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tabulations are also provided by country but there are too few subjects from Estonia to comment. For Germany and Spain the reporting rates for solicited symptoms overall by subject were broadly similar between countries.

At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 52-57% of subjects in each treatment group. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported in ~3-5% per group, most commonly bronchiolitis, bronchitis, URTI and gastroenteritis. Most occurred within the first 4 days of a dose. Overall, the unsolicited AEs were very scattered in nature by PT. Skin rashes, collectively, were very common but individual rash types were diverse.

Drug-related AEs were reported for ~2-4% per group, most commonly diarrhoea, vomiting and injection site induration. As shown below, these were also scattered in nature. Apart from the AEs associated with the injection site it seems unlikely that the others were related to vaccination. The unsolicited AEs of epilepsy and hypotonia were both Grade 3 and serious. The case of hypotonia was in the MenC-CRM197 group. The case of epilepsy occurred in the 3-dose MenACWY-TT group and is discussed below.

## AEs in the booster phase to ESFU (6 months post-booster dose)

All subjects vaccinated in the booster phase received a dose of meningococcal vaccine and all except one in the MenC-CRM197 group (99.8%) received the designated additional vaccines. During the 8-day follow-up period, at least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited) was reported in 86-89% per group and most were considered to be vaccine-related. Grade 3 symptoms were reported in ~22% per group. The majority was reported during the 4-day follow-up period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 19. Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 8-day (Days 0-7) post-vaccination period (Booster Total Vaccinated cohort)

Redness and pain were the most frequently reported solicited local symptoms in all four groups. Grade 3 redness was reported in 0.6-1.2% per group but Grade 3 pain was reported in ~4-6%. When viewed by vaccine injection site local symptoms were generally less common at the meningococcal vaccine sites compared to Infanrix hexa or Synflorix sites.

(from table 415 - Module 5.3.5.1 study report body)

Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom (~58% in each group) with Grade 3 irritability in 7-9% per group. About one third had fever after the booster dose. Fever &gt;39 0 C was common.

At least one unsolicited AE was reported by about one third of subjects per group and Grade 3 events were reported in ~3, most frequently gastroenteritis and URTI. About 1% of subjects had unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related but these were scattered in nature, as shown below.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths and SAEs

There were no fatal events reported at any stage of the study.

Any SAE was reported up to the day preceding the booster dose by ~6-8% per group but none was considered vaccine-related. Any SAE was reported from the primary vaccination to the end of the ESFU (6 months after the booster dose) by ~10% per group. In both cases bronchiolitis and bronchitis predominated.

From study start to one month post-primary vaccination, one subject had an SAE of epilepsy which was considered by the investigator to be vaccine related. The onset occurred 7 days after the third dose of MenACWY-TT, the subject was hospitalised and was recorded as still recovering at the cut-off date (05 November 2015). One subject in the MenC-TT group reported four SAEs considered not related to study vaccines (bronchitis, elevated AST, ALT and ALP). The subject was hospitalized for 3 days after the onset of bronchitis which occurred 37 days after vaccination with Synflorix and Infanrix hexa (dose 2) and this resolved. The elevated enzymes occurred 38 and 97 days after vaccination and did not recover/resolve. One SAE of febrile convulsion was reported up to the pre-boost visit. This occurred in the 3-dose MenACWY group but the onset was several months after the third dose.

Any SAE was reported from the booster vaccination up to the end of the ESFU by ~3% per group but none was considered vaccine-related. There were 3 additional SAEs of febrile convulsion but these cases occurred in the monovalent meningococcal conjugate groups.

## Laboratory findings

Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiograms, X-rays, vital signs) that were judged by the investigator to be clinically significant were to be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they met the definition of an AE or SAE. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that were detected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during the study or were present at baseline and significantly worsened following the start of the study were to be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that were associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject's condition, or that were present or detected at the start of the study and did not worsen, were not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

## Concomitant medications /vaccinations

In the primary phase intake of concomitant medication(s) was reported for about half the subjects in each group during the 8-day post-vaccination period. Although ~35% per group received antipyretic medication &lt; 2% received a prophylactic antipyretic. Most of the intake was during the 4-day post-vaccination period. During 31 days post-dose use of concomitant medication(s) was reported for ~60% per group and ~40% received antipyretic medication.

After the booster dose intake of concomitant medication(s) was reported for about one third of subjects in each treatment group. About 20% received any antipyretic but &lt; 1% received a prophylactic antipyretic. Most use was within 4 days of the dose. Up to 31 days post-booster about 40% had concomitant medication(s) and about 25% received any antipyretic.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Five subjects withdrew due to an AE or SAE during the primary phase of the study. Two withdrew due to SAEs and one withdrew due to an AE in the ACWY\\_3 group. One subject withdrew due to an SAE in the MenC-CRM197 group and one withdrew due to an AE in the MenC-TT group. The three SAEs in two subjects leading to withdrawal from the study were considered unrelated to study vaccine and were:

- 1) Apparent life threatening illness/Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)
- 2) Muscle spasms
- 3) RSV bronchiolitis

No adverse events led to premature discontinuation of the study in the booster phase.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

In light of co-administration of the meningococcal conjugate vaccines with Infanrix hexa and Synflorix in the primary and booster phases the overall safety profile was not substantially different between the four groups since it was driven by the background routine infant immunisations. The profile, including the range of unsolicited AEs, was typical of that observed with routine infant and toddler vaccinations and reflected what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the monovalent meningococcal conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with sequential doses and mostly decreased slightly.

Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC vaccines and these, collectively, were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine vaccines given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were comparable across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high and fevers exceeding 39 0 C were common. In this study there was very little use of prophylactic anti-pyretic use. There does not seem to be a need to make a specific statement about prophylactic anti-pyretic use in the Nimenrix SmPC since this is covered by relevant SmPCs for co-administered

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccines. Despite the lack of prophylactic anti-pyretics, there was a single febrile convulsion reported in a recipient of MenACWY-TT, which occurred a long time after the last dose and was not related.

With regard to the SAE of epilepsy which was considered by the investigator to be vaccine related and had onset 7 days after the third dose of MenACWY-TT, the MAH was asked to report the final outcome and provided an updated narrative. The investigators considered that the clinical picture of this boy could be due to an infectious disease or an intercurrent illness or could be related to vaccination. The investigator reports that the SAE of epilepsy resolved as of 20 October 2012. Whether or not vaccination was a trigger remains unsubstantiated. Even if this is the case, it is not possible to determine which vaccine might have been causative.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Study MenACWY-TT-083 showed that the overall safety profile was not substantially different between the four groups including the range of unsolicited AEs, and it was typical of that observed with routine infant and toddler vaccinations, reflecting what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the monovalent meningococcal conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with sequential doses and mostly decreased slightly.

Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC vaccines and both were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine vaccines given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were comparable across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high and fevers exceeding 39 0 C were common, which was expected due to concomitant vaccinations and lack of use of anti-pyretics in the study.

Nimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135, and Y.

Section 4.2:

## Posology

Nimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations.

## Infants from 6 to 12 weeks of age

The recommended immunisation series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml. The primary infant series consists of two doses, with the first dose given from 6 weeks of age and with an interval of 2 months between doses. The third (booster) dose is recommended at 12 months of age (see section 5.1).

In section 4.8 the MAH has added a short paragraph on infant data and has amended the table (AEs frequencies - see Product Information).

In addition to the new data included in section 5.1, during the procedure the CHMP recommended that section 5.1 be rationalised by age group. For example, all the data for infants, including booster responses, are shown in a single table for each of rSBA and hSBA (see Product Information).

Changes were also made to the PI to improve clarity, streamline redundant text and to incorporate changes of variations that concluded in parallel (variations II-45 and II-53). These changes were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- As part of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application for Nimenrix, the MAH performed a readability test of the Package Leaflet.
- An additional patient consultation for the proposed update has not been performed as it is considered that the changes in the Package Leaflet are not significant enough to warrant additional readability testing. Nimenrix was already intended for use in small children from 1 year of age on, with the extension of the indication to infants aged 2 months - 1 year, and from 1 dose in over 1's to 2 doses in infants the PL does change significantly. There is no change to the presentation, legal status, active substance or other changes as per the guideline which would warrant further consultation with the target patient group at this time.
- Further, the product will be administered by healthcare professionals who are trained to administer and follow dosing schedules for vaccines.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

This variation does not impact in any way on the current approval for Nimenrix from the age of 12 months. Therefore the following sections consider only the new data and benefit-risk in infants when Nimenrix is used from 6 weeks of age.

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The MAH's study to identify a suitable regimen for use in infants was of adequate design and conduct. The inference of efficacy is based on a measure of functional antibody. There is adequate evidence available to support this approach and therefore an application based on comparisons of safety and SBA is acceptable. There is no appropriate comparator for MenA, W or Y in infants. Use of two MenCC vaccines with different conjugating proteins was appropriate.

The data support use of Nimenrix from 2 months of age. On request, the MAH provided a further breakdown of numbers aged 6-8 vs. &gt;8 weeks at the time of the first dose (which showed similar proportions above and below 8 weeks) and their immune responses to meningococcal antigens to substantiate use from 6 weeks of age.

This study met all six of the pre-defined elements of the primary analysis, which was conducted in a hierarchical fashion using an appropriate non-inferiority margin. In the primary series the rSBA data indicated at least comparable responses to MenC between either 2 or 3 doses of MenACWY-TT and the two monovalent MenC conjugates. In addition, the data showed that the lower bounds of the 95% CI around the differences in percentages with MenC rSBA titres ≥1:8 were actually within -4%. On this basis, either of the two infant regimens of Nimenrix could be considered adequate for eliciting satisfactory immune responses to MenC. Only at the higher cut-offs, reflecting the differences in GMTs, was there a possible advantage for the monovalent MenC vaccines. Even then, &gt;90% in the MenACWY groups had rSBA titres

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥1:128, hence it seems unlikely that the differences observed are clinically important. The post-primary hSBA titres also showed similar results.

Some of the findings suggested that 2 doses of MenACWY might actually be better than 3 doses. For example, rSBA GMTs for MenC were significantly lower for the 3-dose group compared to the other three groups (95% CI did not overlap). Overall, the 2-dose infant regimen of Nimenrix is considered acceptable with regard to immune responses to MenC. The rSBA responses to MenA, W and Y did not suggest an advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT. In each case very high percentages in both groups had rSBA titres ≥1:8 at M3 of the study (i.e. at about 5 months of age). The lower confidence interval limits around the percentages with rSBA titres ≥1:8 were &gt;80% for each meningococcal serogroup. This finding also applied to percentages with titres ≥1:128 except for MenY in the 3-dose group (76.6%) and MenA in the 2-dose group (78.2%). There is no comparator but the data support the adequacy of Nimenrix for use in infancy. Although descriptive, the hSBA data showed a very similar pattern of post-primary between-group comparisons as described for the rSBA data for each meningococcal serogroup. The hSBA data demonstrated a greater advantage for 2 vs. 3 doses of MenACWY-TT than the rSBA data.

Since there is no advantage for 3 vs. 2 doses of MenACWY-TT in infants, the 2-dose regimen, with at least 8 weeks between doses, is preferable.

Concerning interactions with other vaccines, the MAH conducted assays of immune responses to co-administered antigens for a representative sample from each treatment group, allowing assessing the impact of MenACWY-TT compared to MenC-CRM197 or MenC-TT. In addition, since all the data on immune responses to meningococcal antigens were obtained against the same background of co-administered vaccines, and since responses to MenACWY-TT were satisfactory in comparison to other treatment groups, it can be concluded that Nimenrix may be given with DTaP-IPV-HBV-PRP-T and with Synflorix. Such data cannot be used to support co-administration of MenACWY-TT with PRP-CRM197 or PRP-D constructs or with Prevenar13 in infancy.

Before and after the booster dose, the rSBA titres were generally comparable between the 2-dose and 3-dose MenACWY-TT groups. Exceptions were higher GMTs for MenW and MenY in the 2-dose vs. 3-dose group with non-overlapping 95% CI. Comparisons with the monovalent MenC groups showed similar proportions with pre- and post-boost titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 across the four groups with lower 95% CI within -4%. The post-boost GMTs for MenC rSBA were similar for the two MenACWY-TT and MenC-CRM197 groups but lower for all 3 vs. MenC-TT with 95% CI that did not overlap. This finding is in keeping with observations made in other studies with NeisVac-C. However, the MenC responses were highly satisfactory for all four groups. All four groups demonstrated an anamnestic response for MenC and the two Nimenrix groups demonstrated anamnestic responses for MenA, W and Y, supporting adequate priming with 2 or 3 doses in infancy. However, there was no strict control group (i.e. one dose of Nimenrix in subjects with no prior vaccination against meningococci) to confirm this supposition. The pre- and post-boost hSBA data showed a comparable pattern of post-boost responses vs. rSBA and further demonstrated anamnestic immune responses to the final dose of MenACWY-TT.

Experience has already demonstrated that a booster dose of MenC is needed. It is very reasonable to assume that this also applies to the other meningococcal serogroups. Immune responses at M12 are clearly anamnestic and can be expected to prolong protection. As in older age groups, for whom a single dose is currently recommended, the need for further doses later in life is not yet fully established. However, long term antibody persistence data for MenC suggest that there could be a benefit from an additional dose(s) after several years have elapsed. This may apply particularly to those who were at the younger end of the age range (e.g. &lt; 5 years old) when first vaccinated. For the present, the SmPC should recommend a booster dose of Nimenrix at 12 months of age for those initially vaccinated in early infancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

As pointed out above, unlike MenC, there is no appropriate comparator for MenA, W or Y in EU infants. Therefore it is only possible to observe the titres obtained and interpret them in light of widely held assumptions regarding the predictive value of SBA for efficacy. The responses to MenA, W and Y were very high and the post-boost responses indicated anamnestic responses (although vaccination of an age-matched unvaccinated control group was not done). While the evidence does support use of Nimenrix in infants, with a mandatory booster at 12 months of age due to the anticipated waning of titres between M4 and M12 of age, the magnitude of the vaccine efficacy that will be conferred cannot be predicted.

For practical reasons immunogenicity was measured in pre-selected subsets. This is an acceptable strategy given the age range studied but it does mean that the available data do reflect subsets.

As with the monovalent MenCC vaccines and for use of Nimenrix in older age groups, it is not yet known whether further booster doses will be needed after the booster dose to be mandated at 12 months of age.

It is not yet known whether Nimenrix can be given with other possible concomitant vaccines, which poses limitations on the routine programmes into which it can fit without adding visits.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

After the primary series, redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in all four groups (in ~70% of the subjects) during the 8-day post-vaccination period followed by pain and swelling. Irritability was the most frequently reported (in &gt;80% of subjects) solicited general symptom in all four groups  during  the  8-day  post-vaccination  period.  Next  common  was  drowsiness  followed  by  loss  of appetite. Low grade fever was very common. Fever &gt;39 0 C was common, although &lt;1% had fever &gt;40 0 C. In light of co-administration of the meningococcal conjugate vaccines with Infanrix hexa and Synflorix in the primary and booster phases the overall safety profile was not substantially different between the four groups studied, since it was driven by the background routine infant immunisations. The profile, including the range of unsolicited AEs, was typical of that observed with routine infant and toddler vaccinations and reflected what is already known about Infanrix hexa, Synflorix and the monovalent meningococcal conjugates. The rates of local and systemic symptoms did not increase with sequential doses and mostly decreased slightly.

Overall, the local reactogenicity of MenACWY-TT appeared to be similar to that of the monovalent MenC vaccines and these, collectively, were associated with fewer local symptoms than the background routine vaccines given, especially when compared with Infanrix hexa. The systemic symptom profiles were comparable across the four groups, reflecting the same background vaccines. The rate of fever was high and fevers exceeding 39 0 C were common. In this study there was very little use of prophylactic anti-pyretic use. There does not seem to be a need to make a specific statement about prophylactic anti-pyretic use in the Nimenrix SmPC since this is covered by relevant SmPCs for co-administered vaccines. Despite the lack of prophylactic anti-pyretic agents there was a single febrile convulsion reported in a recipient of MenACWY-TT, which occurred a long time after the last dose and was not related.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There was no control group that received only Infanrix hexa and Synflorix for comparison. Nevertheless, the comparisons made suggest that the various meningococcal conjugates were not really contributing much to the overall safety profiles.

Just over 1000 subjects received at least one dose of Nimenrix in this study. Since the MAH proposes 2 rather than 3 doses the safety data from all subjects who received Nimenrix can be taken into account as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relevant. Whereas for a completely new vaccine this safety database for a vaccine potentially to be widely used in infants would be considered small, taking into account the wealth of safety information already available with Nimenrix itself in older age groups and with MenCC vaccines in infants as well as the actual data available there seems to be a sufficient database available.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Based on functional antibody responses, whether measured by rSBA or hSBA, two doses of Nimenrix in early infancy since 6 weeks of age with a booster dose at 12 months of age appears to elicit a high probability of protection in early life associated with efficient priming of the infant immune system, as demonstrated by the anamnestic responses to the booster dose at 12 months of age. For MenC the comparable responses observed with Nimenrix vs. licensed monovalent vaccines supports a conclusion on efficacy. Whereas the magnitude of protection against MenA, W and Y cannot be predicted from the SBA responses, all the available evidence supports a benefit. There is no indication at present that Nimenrix presents any additional safety concern over and above the routine infant vaccines with which it will be given.

## Conclusion

Based on the above, the benefit-risk balance of Nimenrix is favourable for use in infants since 6 weeks of age in the approved indication.
