## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  tislelizumab,  the  scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports including in two cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in  view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between tislelizumab and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  tislelizumab  should  be  amended accordingly.

In view of available data on cystitis noninfective from clinical trials and the literature including in three  cases  a  close  temporal  relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge  and  in  view  of  a  plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tislelizumab and cystitis noninfective is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tislelizumab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tislelizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tislelizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
