## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Fibromyalgia  (FMS)  is  a  common  chronic  disease.  It  affects  at  least  2%  of  the  world's  general population, mostly adult women.

Hallmarks  of  fibromyalgia  are  widespread  pain  for  at  least  3 months  and  pain  in  at  least  11  of  18 anatomically defined tender points. In addition to pain and tenderness, patients suffer a constellation of  debilitating  symptoms,  including  fatigue,  decreased  ability  to  function  in  daily  life,  poor  sleep, decreased  health-related  quality  of  life,  stiffness,  depression,  and  anxiety.  Pain  levels  reported  by patients with fibromyalgia are significant and long-lasting; reports of mean baseline pain range from 6.4 to 7.1 on 0 to 10 numerical rating scales or 0 to 10 on visual analogue scales (VAS). This pain level often persists over long periods.

There  is  increasing  evidence  that  non-restorative  sleep  and  its  influence  on  peripheral  functions promote hyperalgesia, fatigue, and bodily hypersensitivity. Early studies demonstrated that fibromyalgia-like symptoms could be induced in healthy subjects by decreasing their quality of sleep, which has since been confirmed in experimental studies using different methodologies. It was further demonstrated  that  a  follow-up  night  of  undisturbed  sleep  after  rapid-eye  movement  (REM)  or slow-wave sleep deprivation, was associated with an increase in pain-tolerance threshold.

Recently, the important role of central nervous system (CNS) hypersensitivity has been emphasized. The fragmentation of slow-wave sleep increases sensitivity  to  pain  as  well  as  to  non-painful  stimuli such as loud sounds and bright light. Fragmented sleep is a result of periodic arousal disturbances and has  been  demonstrated  in  fibromyalgia  patients  using  polysomnography;  the  high  index  of  such arousal disturbances in fibromyalgia patients is an indicator of sleep instability and is associated with unrefreshing, less efficient sleep and is correlated to the severity of clinical symptoms in fibromyalgia patients.

Varying brain functions during sleep and waking phases are involved in circadian changes in metabolic functions of the body. For example, growth hormone production occurs in the very early sleep stages and  is  associated  with  the  emergence  of  slow-wave  sleep  or  deep  sleep.  Several  studies  have demonstrated  decreased  growth  hormone  levels  and  disturbances  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal  axis  in  fibromyalgia  patients.  In  addition,  neurotransmitter  functions  and  dysfunctions  in fibromyalgia  patients  also  contribute  to  hypersensitivity  and  disordered  sleep.  There  is  evidence suggesting sodium oxybate-induced neuromodulation of the monoaminergic, glutaminergic, cholinergic, and opioidergic systems as well as possible modification of growth hormone secretion and neurosteroids production. It  has  also  been  described  that  sodium  oxybate  reduced  pain  and  fatigue associated with fibromyalgia, increased slow-wave sleep, and decreased alpha intrusions into non-REM slow-wave sleep (SWS).

In the European Union (EU), no drug has the approved therapeutic indication fibromyalgia, but multiple medications are used as therapy in fibromyalgia patients, like SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, NSAIDs and other analgesics, and anticonvulsants. In addition, non-pharmacological treatment such as cognitive therapy, acupuncture and physical training is applied on the patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proposed dosing regimen initially applied for was a starting and recommended maintenance dose of  4.5 g/day sodium oxybate (divided into two equal doses) with possible increased up to 6 g/day in patients with severe symptoms based on individual patient response and tolerability.

Xyrem oral  solution  500  mg/ml  (sodium  oxybate)  is  currently  approved  in  the  EU  for  treatment  of narcolepsy  with  cataplexy  in  adult  patients  with  a  recommended  starting  dose  is  4.5  g/day  sodium oxybate (divided into two equal doses). The dose should be titrated to effect based on efficacy and tolerability up to a maximum of 9 g/day.

This type II variation was initially submitted to extend the indication as follows:

'Xyrem is indicated in adults: Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of fibromyalgia.'

On the basis of the data provided, the CHMP did not support the extension of the indication. However, as a result of the evaluation of the new data, the CHMP recommends to update the SmPC and the Package Leaflet accordingly, as described in the scientific discussion.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## Scientific Advice

A CHMP scientific advice for sodium oxybate (EMEA/H/SA/731/1/2006) was provided on 27 July 2006 pertaining to non clinical and clinical aspects.

## 3.2. Non Clinical aspects

In line with the CHMP scientific advice, no further animal studies have been conducted to characterise the pharmacological and toxicity profile of sodium oxybate to support the indication initially applied for since the previously submitted non clinical data were considered sufficient.

## Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA)

In  line  with  CHMP  guideline  on  environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the  company  provided  a  justification  to  be  exempted  of  the  ERA requirement for the indication initially applied for due to the nature of Xyrem. Xyrem contains sodium oxybate,  also  known  as γ -hydroxybutyric  acid  (GHB)  which  is  an  endogenous  constituent  of mammalian brain thought to be synthesised from GABA in GABAergic neurons, acting in similar way to some  neurotransmitters  in  the  mammalian  brain,  and  therefore  is  not  expected  to  impact  on  the environment.

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

## 3.3.1. Introduction

The development program completed to support the indication initially applied for, consisted of:

- -Four  Phase I studies to investigate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects of sodium oxybate when co-administered with fomepizole ( 07-004 ), duloxetine ( 07-005 ), lorazepam ( 07-007 ), tramadol ( 07-008 );

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -One randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase II study ( OMC-SXB26 ) to investigate 4.5 g or 6g/night of sodium oxybate taken orally in 2 equally divided doses;
- -Two randomised double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 14 week, Phase III studies ( 06-008 and 06-009) to investigate 4.5g and 6g/night of sodium oxybate taken orally in 2 equally divided doses;
- -An open label, 38 week study ( 06-010 ) designed to provide additional data on long term of safety and efficacy and to assess long term effects on quality of life (QoL).

Updated  data  were  also  provided  concerning  absolute  bioavailability  of  sodium  oxybate  and  a pharmacokinetic study (06-015) performed in the elderly population was submitted.

Regarding the clinical aspects, the present submission was  not in line with following  main recommendations from 2006 CHMP scientific advice:

- -Results of the phase II study showed that point estimates for 4.5g/night for the majority of evaluated scores (+subscores) and questionnaires of the three co-primary measures and the secondary  endpoints  were  within  the  range  of  the  results  of  the  6g/night  group.  Moreover, some of the results indicate that a dose of 4.5g/night might lead to better results in terms of efficacy. Therefore the Company is advised to reconsider the proposed titration regimen also regarding  endpoints  not  directly  related  to  tolerability.  It  would  have  been  good  practice  to conduct a proper dose-finding study in this population. Apparently, 3g/night was never tested in  the  fibromyalgia  population,  supposedly  due  to  a  lack  of  efficacy  of  that  dose  in  the treatment of narcolepsy. The Company should consider the possibility that 3g/night could be effective in the fibromyalgia population and might show better tolerability. From the narcolepsy dossier  it  is  known  that  the  9g/night  dose  gives  rise  to  serious  safety  concerns  and  it  is certainly undesirable to include it in the dose range.
- -Currently no specific regulatory guidelines to develop/register a new  product  for the management of FMS are available. However, minimum requirements regarding study duration included  in  the  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  intended  for  the treatment of neuropathic pain (CHMP/EWP/252/03) should be adopted for the phase III setting in  FMS.  Therefore,  the  proposed  study  duration  of  12  weeks  after  a  stable  dose  has  been achieved in all treatment groups is generally endorsed. Since FMS is a chronic disorder, it is emphasized that  a  12-week  duration  can  only  support  the  short-term  treatment  of  FMS.  In order  to  support  a  claim  for  long-term  treatment,  the  maintenance  of  effect  and  possible development of tolerance need to be investigated, e.g. in an open label study extension phase lasting  12  months.  Alternatively  a  relapse  prevention  study  could  be  envisaged.  As  in  the narcolepsy development program, the investigation of maintenance of effect would require a sufficient number of patients being switched from the phase III (carried out in the EU) to the open label phase.
- -Since fibromyalgia is a common condition and Xyrem is a drug with a number of uncertainties regarding safety, it is advisable to enlarge the database to figures closer to the recommended 1500 exposures.
- -Approval for the indication 'treatment of FMS' in the EU can only be sought if the proposed treatment leads to an improvement in different dimensions that are specific for FMS, minimum requirements  for  the  claim  to  use  Xyrem  as  a  long-term  treatment  in  FMS  are  met. Furthermore,  at  least  one  of  the  two  proposed  phase  III  studies  and  open  label  extensions concerning the investigation of maintenance of effect as well as safety should be conducted in the EU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH stated that the clinical trials have been conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. No GCP inspections were conducted in the clinical program for fibromyalgia.

## 3.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Absolute  bioavailability  was  not  specifically  studied  at  the  time  of  the  initial  authorisation.  In  the literature, limited data suggested a bioavailability of 28%. This low figure was considered probably due to  a  high  first  pass  metabolism.  Within  the  present  application,  the  MAH  submitted  a  specific bioavailability study. An absolute bioavailability from the oral solution given as once- and twice-daily administrations of 2.25 g sodium oxybate and once-daily administration of 4.5 g sodium oxybate of about 88% was observed in reference to a 5 minute IV infusion of the same doses.

## Metabolism

Studies  in  vitro  with  pooled  human  liver  cytochromes  indicated  that  sodium  oxybate  did  not significantly  inhibit  the  activities  of  the  human  isoenzymes:  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, CYP2E1,  or  CYP3A4  up  to  the  concentration  of  3mM  (378 μ g/mL).  However,  these  levels  are considerably lower than levels achieved with therapeutic doses. Given the potential increased in human exposure  with  the  indication  initially  applied  for,  complementary  data  would  be  required  to  cover  a concentration range that is sufficiently high for detecting clinically relevant inhibition.

## Special population

## Study 06-015 (elderly)

No  relevant  difference  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  patients  &lt;65  years  and  patients ≥ 65 years up to 3 g/d sodium oxybate were observed. As there is no information indicating relevant agedependent  changes  in  the  major  elimination  pathway  of  sodium  oxybate,  no  changes  in  the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate in patients ≥ 65 years are expected at the maximal recommended dose of 9 g/d (4.5 g twice per night) for sodium oxybate. When administering sodium oxybate at the maximally recommended doses of 9 g/d in patients ≥ 65 years, an impaired motor and/or cognitive function cannot be excluded.

## Pharmacokinetics interaction studies

Four  Phase  I  studies  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetic  effects  of  sodium  oxybate  when  coadministered  with  fomepizole  ( 07-004 ),  duloxetine  ( 07-005 ),  lorazepam  ( 07-007 ),  tramadol  ( 07008 );

## Study 07-004 (fomepizole)

The mean plasma concentration time curves demonstrate that co-administration of fomepizole did not prolong  sodium  oxybate  exposure.  The  objective,  allowing  a  once-nightly  administration  of  sodium oxybate  via  the  extension  of  the  sodium  oxybate  half-life  by  fomepizole  was  not  met.  No  further detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were therefore conducted.

## Study 07-005 (duloxetine)

Co-administration  of  sodium  oxybate  (2.25g/day)  and  duloxetine  (60mg/day)  resulted  in  similar pharmacokinetic  profiles  to  those  observed  when  each  of  these  drugs  was  given  alone  and  did  not appear to worsen sleepiness with an increase in VAS  over the first 5 hours and a magnitude of mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changes from predose over this time period similar for sodium oxybate alone and in combination with duloxetine.

## Study 07-007(lorazepam)

Co-administration  of  sodium  oxybate  (2.25g/day)  and  lorazepam  (2mg/day)  resulted  in  similar pharmacokinetic profiles to those observed when each of these drugs was given alone, however it did produce sleepiness with an increased effect  when  sodium  oxybate  and  lorazepam  were  coadministered.  Attention  and  cognition  as  measured  by  Digit  Symbol  Substitution  Test  (DSST)  were least affected when sodium oxybate was administered alone.

## Study 07-008 (tramadol)

Co-administration  of  tramadol  (100  mg/day)  with  sodium  oxybate  (2.25g/day)  resulted  in  relative similar  pharmacokinetic  profiles  to  those  observed  when  each  of  these  drugs  was  given  alone.  The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparison of tramadol and O-desmethyl tramadol AUC0-24 and Cmax  ss  with  and  without  sodium  oxybate  co-administration  were  partially  contained  in  the bioequivalence range, slightly exceeding the upper end. However, the results did not necessary reflect the effect in a clinical setting where tramadol is dosed twice daily or at bedtime and when Xyrem is given in much higher doses at a daily basis. Similar increases in mean sleepiness VAS were observed with  sodium  oxybate  alone  and  in  combination  with  tramadol.  However  this  finding  should  be interpreted cautiously since tramadol is only administered as a single dose 11 hours before the dosing of Xyrem and tramadol alone had little impact on sleepiness.

## OMC-SXB-17 (modafinil)

No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  were  observed  between  sodium  oxybate  (4.5g)  and  modafinil  (200 mg).Sodium oxybate has been administered concomitantly with CNS stimulant agents in approximately 80% of patients in clinical studies in narcolepsy. Whether this affected respiration during the night is unknown  and  this  has  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  considering  a  potential  pharmacodynamic interaction cannot be ruled out since only a single dose of modafinil 200 mg was used.

## Mechanism of action

GHB  binds  to  two  receptors,  the  gamma  hydroxybutyrate  receptor  (GHBR)  and  the  gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) B-subtype (GABAB) receptor in central nervous system tissues ( Lingenhoehl et al. 1999, Mathivet et al. 1997 ). Although the exact mechanism by which sodium oxybate reduces pain  in  fibromyalgia  is  unknown,  sodium  oxybate  is  believed  to  inhibit  central  pain  ( Sherman  &amp; Gebhart  1975 )  through  stimulation  of  the  GABAB  receptor,  which  may  result  in  inhibition  of  spinal neurons and/or inhibition  of  excitatory  neurotransmitter  release  in  the  spinal  cord  ( Chanimov et al. 1999,  Hosli  et  al.  1983 ).  Actions  at  supraspinal  sites  may  also  contribute  to  the  clinical  effects  of sodium oxybate on pain ( Potes et al. 2006 ). The role of the GHBR in central pain inhibition is unknown. GHB does not have activity at mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors ( Feigenbaum &amp; Simantov 1996 ). Sodium  oxybate/GHB  is  known  to  modulate  the  activity  of  noradrenergic  (Szabo  et  al.  2004), serotonergic  ( Gobaille  et  al.  2002,  Waldmeier  &amp;  Fehr  1978 ),  and  dopaminergic  ( Madden &amp; Johnson 1998, Aghajanian &amp; Roth 1970 ) pathways in animal models and promote growth hormone secretion in humans ( Van Cauter et al. 1997 )  and in animal models ( Bluet-Pajot et al. 1978 ).  Sodium oxybate's effects  on  sleep  may  contribute  to  its  effects  on  pain  reduction.  In  a  dose-related  manner,  sodium oxybate  decreases  wake  after  sleep  onset  (WASO),  increases  non  REM  sleep,  including  Stage  3/4 (slow-wave sleep) and reduces sleep disruption, which is linked to decreased pain threshold, decreased inhibition of pain, and somatic symptoms of widespread pain ( Black et al. 2009, Mamelak et al. 2004, Scharf  et  al.  2003,  Lapierre  et  al.  1990,  Smith  et  al.  2007,  Onen  et  al.  2001,  Lentz  et  al.  1999, Moldofsky et al. 1975 ).

## Primary and Secondary Pharmacology

Pharmacodynamic  effects  of  sodium  oxybate  on  sleepiness;  attention  and  cognition  have  been investigated in the newly submitted interaction studies in healthy volunteers. Results were previously discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic profile of sodium oxybate.

## 3.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

In a specific study, the absolute bioavailability from the oral solution given as once- and twice-daily administrations of 2.25 g sodium oxybate and once-daily administration of 4.5 g sodium oxybate of about 88% was observed in reference to a 5 minute IV infusion of the same doses. The CHMP agreed to update this value in the SmPC which was originally based on limited literature data.

Elderly  population  was  not  originally  studied. In  a  specific  study  conducted  in  a  limited  number  of patients greater than the age of 65 years the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate was not different compared to patients younger than 65 years of age. This information has now been reflected in the SmPC.

Given the potential increase in human exposure with the indication initially applied for (fibromyalgia), complementary  in  vitro  data  on  human  liver  cytochromes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6) would be required by the CHMP to cover a concentration range that is sufficiently high for detecting clinically relevant inhibition.

Following the results of the new interaction studies conducted with fomepizole, duloxetine, lorazepam and tramadol, the CHMP noted that some of these studies did not include the maximal recommended doses for each drug. Following clarifications from the MAH, the CHMP concluded the following:

- -No relevant information to be included in the SmPC from the study with fomepizole taking into consideration  that  once-nightly  administration  of  sodium  oxybate  via  the  extension  of  the sodium oxybate half-life by fomepizole was not met.
- -No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  is  expected  at  the  maximal  recommended  daily  dose  of  9  g (4.5 g twice per night) for sodium oxybate and the maximal dose of 120 mg/d for duloxetine. No  additional  effect  on  sleepiness  was  observed  when  comparing  single  doses  of  sodium oxybate alone (2.25 g) and sodium oxybate (2.25 g) in combination with duloxetine (60 mg at steady state).
- -An increase of symptoms of CNS depression and/or respiratory depression cannot be excluded when combining the maximally recommended daily dose of 9 g sodium oxybate (4.5 g twice per night) with lorazepam (6 mg/day) or tramadol (400 mg/day).
- -In addition, the MAH performed a literature search on the available data on interaction with Xyrem up to July 2010. Non clinical data were found relevant to be added to the SmPC and were related to cross tolerance with baclofen that was clearly demonstrated in rodents. Some of  the  data  were  already  reflected  in  the  SmPC ( ethanol,  morphine,  oxytocin,  flumenazil); others referred to illicit drugs (phencyclidine, MDMA )and were considered not relevant for the therapeutic  use  of  Xyrem  and  therefore  not  included  in  the  SmPC.  Additionally,  data  on interactions  with  ritonavir/saquinavir  and  salicylic  acid/probenecid  were  also  found;  however these were lacking of information to be included in the SmPC.

Adequate information has been reflected in the SmPC on the basis of the above conclusion (see section 3.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding  pharmacodynamic  profile  of  Xyrem,  effects  on  sleepiness,  attention  and  cognition  were investigated in the pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers.

## 3.3.4. Conclusion on clinical pharmacology

Overall, the MAH performed additional interaction studies relevant to the indication initially applied for (fibromyalgia). Further investigation on the metabolism (interaction with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6) would be required by the CHMP, given the potential increased in human exposure.

## 3.4. Clinical efficacy

The Phase II study ( OMC-SXB-26 ), the 2 short term Phase III studies ( 06-008 and 06-009) and the open label long term study ( 06-010 ) are presented below.

## 3.4.1. Dose response study

Study OMC-SXB-26 was  a  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group study  in  subjects  diagnosed  with  fibromyalgia  according  to  the  American  College  of  Rheumatology (ACR, Wolfe et al, 1990). The study was conducted in the United States (US) only.

Subjects underwent screening assessments and those who met the eligibility criteria underwent a drug withdrawal and washout period during which time pain medications and any treatment for fibromyalgia were  gradually  withdrawn.  At  the  end  of  the  2-week  baseline  assessment  period,  subjects  who continued to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and who reported an average pain score above 4 (on a VAS of 0 to 10) during the last week of the baseline period were randomised to one of three treatment groups:  Xyrem  4.5  g/night,  Xyrem  6  g/night,  or  placebo.  During  the  double-blind  treatment  period subjects  received  Xyrem  4.5  g/night,  Xyrem  6  g/night,  or  matching  placebo  in  two  equally  divided doses each night for 8 weeks. Follow-up visits were scheduled 2, 4, and 8 weeks after initial dosing.

A  total  of  195  patients  were  randomised.  Most  (91.6%)  randomised  subjects  did  not  consider themselves to be normal sleepers. More than half (53.1%) described their usual sleep as poor and 42.8% described their usual sleep as fair. The mean clinical global impression scores (CGIs) at baseline for the placebo, Xyrem 4.5 g/night, and Xyrem 6 g/night groups were 4.2, 4.0, and 4.1 (using a 6point scale where 1=normal, 4=moderately ill, and 6=among the most extremely ill).

The primary efficacy parameter (Fibromyalgia Syndrome Composite Response) was a binary composite parameter for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. The proportion of subjects in each treatment group that met all 3 of the following response criteria was compared to assess the efficacy of Xyrem in response to fibromyalgia syndrome.

-  Pain Severity: Overall pain severity was assessed by pain VAS data recorded 3 times a day by the subject  in  an  electronic  diary  (eDiary).  For  pain  VAS,  a  response  was  defined  as  a  reduction  in average pain of 20% or greater from baseline to Week 8.
-  Functionality (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire [FIQ]): Change from baseline to a study visit was assessed. A response was defined as a reduction of 20% or greater in FIQ total score from baseline to Week 8.
-  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc): The subject's perception of the overall improvement in their fibromyalgia symptoms was assessed by means of the PGIc questionnaire completed at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Main  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were:  Severity  of  Pain,  Fibromyalgia  Impact  Questionnaire  (FIQ) Total  Score,  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIc),  Subjective  and  Objective  Assessments  of Sleep and Fatigue.

Results of the primary analysis (ITT) are summarised in Table 1.

Secondary analysis of the primary efficacy parameter using the PP population did not show statistically significant differences between the treatment groups using LOCF, BOCF, or observed data.

An exploratory analysis of the primary efficacy parameter was performed changing the criteria for a responder to a 30% reduction in the Pain VAS and the FIQ total score. Results are shown in Table 2:

## Effect on pain

The average change in pain scores from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) was a reduction of 16.91 and 19.47 for subjects in the 4.5 and 6 g/night groups, respectively, and a reduction of 9.60 for subjects in the placebo group using a VAS scale of 0 to 100 (where 0=no pain and 100=worst imaginable pain). Xyrem  6  g/night  showed  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  overall  pain  severity  compared  to placebo  (p=0.006),  and  Xyrem  4.5  g/night  showed  a  reduction  in  pain  severity  approaching

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significance  compared  to  placebo  (p=0.051).The  proportions  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  30%  or greater  reduction  in  pain  severity  in  the  Xyrem  4.5  and  6  g/night  groups  were  41.4%  and  47.6%, respectively, compared to 23.8% for subjects in the placebo group (p=0.039 and p=0.005 for 4.5 and 6g/night, respectively).

## Effect on multidimensional function

The  FIQ  total  score  was  significantly  reduced  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for  both  Xyrem  groups compared to placebo (p=0.028 and p=0.029 for 4.5 and 6g/night, respectively). The proportions of subjects who achieved a 30% or greater reduction in the FIQ total score were 48.1% and 50.8% of subjects  in  the  Xyrem  4.5  and  6  g/night  groups,  respectively,  compared  to  26.7%  of  subjects  who received placebo (p=0.018 and p=0.006 for for 4.5 and 6g/night, respectively).

## Effect on patient global

The  Patient  Global  Impression  of  Change  (PGIc)  showed  40%  of  subjects  who  received  Xyrem  4.5 g/night and 33.3% of subjects who received Xyrem 6 g/night rated their symptoms at endpoint (Week 8)  as  'very  much  better'  or  'much  better'  compared  to  20%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group (p=0.019 and p=0.095 for 4.5 and 6g/night, respectively).

## Effect on sleep

Subjective assessments of sleep showed statistically significant reductions from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) for severity of daytime sleepiness (ESS) and sleep impairment (JS), and significantly less difficulty  from  being  sleepy  or  tired  while  performing  specific  activities  (FOSQ)  for  subjects  in  both Xyrem groups compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001 for all secondary measures). Subjective assessments of fatigue showed statistically significant reductions from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) for fatigue VAS scores for subjects in both Xyrem groups compared to placebo (p=0.038 and p=0.004  for 4.5 and 6g/night, respectively). Statistically significant changes in objective measures  of sleep using polysomnography compared to placebo included increased Stage 2 and Stage 3 &amp; 4 sleep (Xyrem 6 g/night),  decreased  REM  sleep  (both  Xyrem  groups),  increased  NREM  sleep  (Xyrem  6  g/night),  and decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO) (Xyrem 6 g/night). Although both doses had increases in Stage 3 &amp; 4 sleep, the difference  from  placebo  was  statistically  significant  for  the  Xyrem  6  g/night group only (p=0.018). Improvements in total sleep time and sleep efficiency from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) were seen for subjects who received Xyrem 6 g/night, but the changes were not statistically significant compared to placebo (p=0.071 and p=0.073, respectively).

## 3.4.2. Main studies

## 3.4.2.1. Short term studies

Two  randomised  multicenter,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group,  14  week,  Phase  III studies ( 06-008 and 06-009 ) to investigate 4.5g and 6g/night of sodium oxybate taken orally in 2 equally divided doses were conducted (see Figure 1) with a safety follow up at week 16. Study 06-008 was conducted in the US only whereas study 06-009 included European sites (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom).

In study 06-008, the volume ingested was greater for the 6 g dose, i.e. 12 ml, than for the 4.5 g dose, i.e.,  9  ml,  as  both  solutions  contented  500  mg/mL. In  study 06-009, however, the concentration of sodium oxybate was different, with 500 mg/mL for the 6 g/night regimen and 375 mg/mL for the 4.5 g/night dose, in order to have the same volume for all three treatment groups (4.5g, 6 g or placebo). Half of the total dose was taken just before sleep, the other half 2.5-4 hours later.

| Primary              | Pain Severity Response (Pain VAS, binary)                                                                                                                | Pain Severity Response (Pain VAS, binary) Functionality Response (FIQ total score, binary) |
| Sequential Secondary | Functionality Response (FIQ total score, binary) Fatigue VAS PGI-c Response (binary) SF-36 Physical Component (PCS) Sleep Patterns (Jenkins Sleep Scale) | Sleep Patterns (Jenkins Sleep Scale) FOSQ (total score) Fatigue VAS                        |

The primary endpoint was pain severity response (defined as the proportion of subjects had at least a 30% reduction in overall pain VAS from baseline to Week 14). The functionality response was defined as  the  proportion  of  subjects  had  at  least  a  30%  reduction  in  the  FIQ  total  score  from  baseline  to Week 14.  In  the  EU,  pain  severity  response  and  functionality  response  were  used  as  co-primary endpoints.

For the Phase 3 controlled studies (06-008 and 06-009), the BOCF analyses of all efficacy endpoints were pre-specified as the primary imputation method in both the US and EU analysis plans. The LOCF and observed data analyses were also performed as sensitivity analyses.

## Sample size

In each study, a sample size of 525 subjects was planned, based on data from Study OMC-SXB-26. This  sample  size  was  estimated  to  provide  at  least  81%  power  to  detect  a  difference  in  both  coprimary endpoints for one dose of Xyrem, assuming the percentages of responders in the Xyrem and placebo groups were 30% and 15%, respectively. These sample size calculations were based on chisquare tests with a significance level of 0.05.

BOCF=baseline observation carried forward, FIQ= Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, FOSQ=Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, ITT=intent-to-treat, LOCF=last observation carried forward, LS=least squares, N/A=not applicable, PGI-c=Patient Global Impression of Change, SE=standard error, SF-36=Short Form-36, VAS=visual analog scale

Note: Baseline was the average of all available daily averages during the last week of the baseline period. For each post-baseline week, the average of all available daily averages for that week was used. Analysis results for the Pain VAS and FIQ response are based on chi-square tests. The p-values for the Composite Responses were obtained from a chi-square test.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from the PP analyses were consistent with the results from the ITT analyses: in study 06-008, results from patients with ≥ 30 % reduction from baseline to week 14 in Pain VAS are 77/108 (71.3 %) and 68/99 (68.7%), both with p&lt;0.001. The corresponding values for FIQ total score were 75/108 (69.4%)  and  68/99  (86.7%)  with  p=0.005  and  0.008,  respectively.  In  study  06-009,  results  from patients with ≥ 30 % reduction from baseline to week 14 in Pain VAS were 63/114 (55.3%) and 56/98 (57.1%), both with p&lt;0.001. The corresponding values for FIQ total score were 70/114 (61.4%) and 62/98 (63.3%), both with p&lt;0.001.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analyses)

Effects  of  demographic  characteristics,  regions  (US  versus  EU)  and  other  characteristics  (nonpharmacological treatment, use of rescue medication) were performed using pooled data from studies 06-008 and 06-009.

## Effects of age, gender and race

Subjects ≥ 65 years (n=45) and subjects &lt;65 years (n=1076) had numerically greater proportions of responders  in  pain  VAS  and  FIQ  total  score  in  both  of  the  Xyrem  groups  compared  to  the  placebo group. The p-values for the &lt;65 years subgroup were &lt;0.001 for these data for both Xyrem groups compared to placebo.

Male  subjects  (n=108)  and  female  subjects  (n=1013)  had  numerically  greater  proportions  of responders  in  pain  VAS  and  FIQ  total  score  in  both  of  the  Xyrem  groups  compared  to  the  placebo group.  The  p-values  for  females  were  &lt;0.001  for  these  data  for  both  Xyrem  groups  compared  to placebo.

Non-Caucasian subjects (n=99) had numerically greater proportions of responders in pain VAS and FIQ total score than the Caucasian subjects (n=1022) at both Xyrem doses.

## Effect of the non pharmacological treatment, use of rescue medication

In both dosing groups a statistically significant difference was observed between active therapy and placebo in the response, independently if non-pharmacological treatment was used or not.

Use  of  rescue  medication  was  clearly  lower  in  patients  receiving  Xyrem  than  in  patients  receiving placebo in the overall phase 3 population (20-30% less).

## Effect of region

This is presented in Tables 11 and 12.

## 3.4.2.1. Long term study

Study 06-010 was an open label, 38 week study designed to provide additional data on long term of safety and efficacy and to assess long term effects on quality of life (QoL). Subjects who completed one of the short term Phase III controlled studies (either Study 06-008 or 06-009) were eligible to enrol in this open-label, continuation study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of Xyrem (see Figure 2).

Figure 2

M=month, Wk(s)=week(s)

Note: In Stmdy 06-0o8, both active treatments contained sodium oxybate at the same concentration; the two doses were achieved by adjusting the volume of active drug solution administered. In Study 06-008, placebo was admimistered in two different volumes to match the volumes of active treatments. In Study 06-009, the two active treatments contained sodium oxybate at different concentrations, enabling administration of the two doses with the same voluume of oral solution. In Study 06009, placebo was admimistered in one volume, matching the two active treatments.

Note: In addition to the visits outlined for all sites in the schematic above, for sites in Gemany, visits were added at Weeks 6, 10, and 14 and telephone contacts were added every 2 weeks (per Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices feedback [BfArMJ). For sites in France, visits were added at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, and 34 to allow study drug dispensing in compliance with French law.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion criteria

- -Subjects completed Study 06-008 or 06-009 within the past 7 days
- -Subjects were able, in the opinion of the investigator, to take Xyrem for approximately 9.5 months and complete all tests and visits described in the protocol
- -Subjects  must  have  been  willing  to  refrain  from  the  use  of  any  medications,  herbal  remedies, and/or  devices  being  used  to  treat  his/her  fibromyalgia  symptoms  until  trial  completion.  Such medications  included  but  were  not  limited  to:  opiates,  benzodiazepines,  muscle  relaxants, cyclobenzaprine, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, dopamine agonists, and/or tramadol.
- -Subjects  agreed  to  use  only  ibuprofen  (up  to  1200  mg/day),  naproxen  (up  to  660  mg/day),  or acetaminophen  (paracetamol)  (up  to  4  g/day)  as  rescue  pain  medication  (Simultaneous  use  of acetaminophen and either ibuprofen or  naproxen was  permitted.  Simultaneous  use  of  ibuprofen and naproxen was not allowed on the same day during the study.)
- -Subjects were willing to not drink alcohol for the duration of the trial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Main exclusion criteria

- -Subjects experienced any serious adverse event that was related to study drug during participation in Study 06-008 or 06-009
- -Subjects in the opinion of the investigator, experienced an adverse event in Protocol 06-008 or 06009  that  may  have  prevented  him/her  from  safely  participating  in  and  completing  the  current study
- -Subjects had any new condition, physical examination finding, or laboratory test result that, in the opinion of the investigator, could have impacted subject safety, interfered with the evaluation of the subject, or affected the subject's compliance with the protocol requirements
- -Subjects developed a current primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder, psychotic disorder, and/or  bipolar  disorder  (Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  IV,  Text  Revision [DSM-IV-TR])
- -Subjects were in the opinion of the investigator, a suicidal or homicidal risk; or the subject scored ≥ 1 on Question 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at Visit 1 or any time during Study 06-008 or 06-009
- -Subjects had a positive urine drug screen for benzodiazepines or other drugs of abuse and/or a positive alcohol test and/or a history of substance abuse
- -Subjects  were  diagnosed  with  sleep  apnea  and  was  not  currently  on  stable  continuous  positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, or the investigator judged that the subject's risk of sleep apnea had increased during the double-blind Study 06-008 or 06-009

## Outcomes/Endpoints

A single primary efficacy endpoint was specified in the analysis plan (the Pain Severity Response from the pain VAS) defined as the proportion of subjects had at least a 30% reduction in overall pain VAS from the prior study baseline to study endpoint.

Secondary  efficacy endpoints included: pain severity (pain VAS  as  a continuous variable); Functionality  Response,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  had  at  least  a  30%  reduction  in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score from the prior study baseline to study endpoint; FIQ total score as a continuous variable; fatigue (fatigue VAS as a continuous variable); Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-c, analyzed as an ordinal categorical and binary outcome variable); Short Form-36  (SF-36)  Physical  Component  Summary  (PCS),  Mental  Component  Summary  (MCS),  and domain scores;  Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Severity  (CGI-s),  Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Change (CGI-c, analyzed as an ordinal categorical and binary outcome variable); Tender Point Count and Index; Manual Tender Point Survey (MTPS) Site Scores; Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) total score and subscale scores; pain by rescue medication use; Fibromyalgia Pain Composite Response; and Fibromyalgia Syndrome Composite Response.

Safety  was  assessed  by  the  incidence  of  adverse  events,  study  drug  exposure,  and  concomitant medication usage; and by changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms, and physical examination findings. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were used to assess depression and suicidality.

## Sample size

All  subjects  who  completed  Studies  06-008  or  06-009  were  eligible  for  enrollment  in  this  study. Enrolment  was  planned  to  achieve  the  following  minimum  targets  for  combined-study  exposure  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

active treatment (i.e., Studies 06-008 or 06-009, and Study 06-010): exposure of 6 months in at least 100 subjects and exposure of 1 year in at least 50 subjects. Because the rollover rate from the prior studies was higher than planned.

Per protocol, the interim report available for this assessment was prepared when 100 subjects with at least 6 months' and 50 subjects with at least 1 year's combined exposure to Xyrem (i.e., in Studies 06008 or 06-009 and the current study) had been accrued. A total of 246 subjects (245 treated) were analyzed for the report available for this assessment.

## Randomisation, Blinding (masking)

There was no randomization in this study. This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Each  efficacy  endpoint  was  analyzed  using  observed  data  in  the  all-treated  population.  Descriptive analyses were performed by time points assessed, summarized by final dose and, for some endpoints, by prior study treatment. Changes were analyzed relative to baseline at the beginning of the previous double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Study endpoint in 06-010 was defined as the last available data, whether obtained at study completion or early discontinuation. In addition, statistical analyses of pain  VAS  and  FIQ  total  score  responders  by  gender  were  conducted.  Safety  data  were  summarized using descriptive statistics in the all-treated population. Changes were analyzed relative to baseline at the  beginning  of  the  previous  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies.  Treatment-emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized by the last dose taken at the time of event onset. TEAEs were also summarized by time of onset and analyzed by gender. For vital signs and laboratory test data, the Study  06-010  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  last  value  collected  during  the  study,  before  the  safety follow-up visit.

## Results

With the initial  submission,  the  MAH  only  submitted  an  interim  analysis.  The  cut-off  for  the  interim analysis  was  10  July  2009,  including  subjects  had  completed  or  discontinued  the  study  up  to  02 December 2008. All patients in the interim analysis data set except one were US. Patients treated with placebo  in  the  lead-in  study  have  a  higher  withdrawal  rate,  particularly  due  to  adverse  events, compared to patients who were treated with Xyrem in the lead-in study.

During the evaluation, the MAH provided the final study report with the complete analysis. Results are summarised below.

## 3.4.2.2. Ancillary analyses

## Effect on sleep pattern over time

At the CHMP request, the MAH provided data effect on sleep over time. In study OMC-SXB-26, results indicated  that  there  was  an  improved  sleep  with  Xyrem  treatment  (Xyrem  4.5  and  6  g/night)  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with fibromyalgia. Subjective sleep assessments revealed significant improvement in daytime sleepiness,  sleep  quality,  and  daytime  functioning.  Improvement  was  reported  as  early  as  2  weeks after initiation of treatment, with effects maintained after 8 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. The  earliest  effects  on  objective  sleep  assessment  were  observed  within  two  weeks  of  starting treatment, and effects on SWS and WASO were maintained throughout treatment. Both Xyrem doses decreased  REM  sleep  compared  to  placebo.  Xyrem  6  g/night  had  a  profound  impact  on  increasing Stage 3 &amp; 4 sleep and non REM sleep and decreasing WASO. Moreover, these measures correlated well with improvement of subjective sleep quality. Unlike conventional hypnotics, Xyrem had no significant impact on total sleep time and sleep latency, as compared to placebo. In study 06-010, data from the FIQ Tired Upon Awakening Subscale revealed an early onset of effect with a consistent and sustained improvement of sleep quality, and support maintenance of the effect of Xyrem on sleep patterns for up to 52 weeks. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to uncontrolled setting and limitation of the subjective measures used to evaluate quality of sleep.

## Extrapolation of US data to the EU population

Further information was submitted by the MAH to support extrapolation of the results observed in the US to the EU population including efficacy subgroup analyses. These are presented in Tables 16 and 17. Research findings from some authors ( de Souza et al, 2009 )  suggested that the level of depression may  indeed  influence  the  treatment  outcome  and  the  perception  of  pain  and  other  symptoms  in fibromyalgia patients and that concomitant depressive symptoms did require treatment.

## Rebound effect/Withdrawal Symptoms

Rebound was not specifically evaluated in the studies of fibromyalgia as efficacy endpoints were not assessed after cessation of treatment.

Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have reported that frequent, around-the-clock patterns of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) administration can produce physical dependence, as evidenced by a withdrawal syndrome ( Abanades et al. 2007 ). Physical dependence (characterized by the emergence of withdrawal signs and/or symptoms upon cessation of use) was reported with daily use of illicit GHB at supra-therapeutic doses of 18 to 250 g/day ( Dyer et al. 2001, Glasper et al. 2005 ). In patients who ingested  these  high  doses  of  illicit  GHB  around-the-clock,  withdrawal  signs  and  symptoms  included psychosis,  agitation,  tachycardia,  hypertension,  delirium  with  auditory  and  visual  hallucinations, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. The onset of these reactions occurred within 1 to 6 hours after the last  dose  of  GHB  and  lasted  5  to  15  days.  One  death  of  a  hospitalized  patient  occurred  as  the withdrawal symptoms were resolving ( Glasper et al. 2005 ). However, there were no adverse events of severe withdrawal symptoms that occurred during any of the Phase 2/3 studies or during the 2-week period after the last dose of study drug in the Phase 3 studies (reflecting data after the final dose in Studies 06-008 or 06-009 for subjects who did not participate in Study 06-010, and after the final dose in Study 06-010), suggesting that withdrawal signs and symptoms were not observed in the population with fibromyalgia.

## 3.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Dose response

The Phase 2 study (OMC-SXB-26) provided preliminary evidence for the efficacy of Xyrem 4.5 and 6 g/night. The study was based solely in the US and conducted before the CHMP scientific advice was obtained. Hence, there were significant differences to the subsequent Phase 3 trials: shorter treatment duration,  different  study  population  and  different  primary  endpoints.  The  study  statistically  failed  to show  efficacy  of  Xyrem  on  the  primary  endpoint  which  was  a  binary  composite  parameter  for  the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome (overall p value=0.052). However, quite consistently, both doses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  both  continuous  and  categorical  (responder)  pain  and functional endpoints, including the ones used as co-primary endpoints (pain VAS, FIQ total score) in the later Phase 3 trials.

No clear dose-response pattern was observed in this study for the chosen primary analysis instrument in the LOCF analysis. However, in the secondary analyses, the 6 g/night dose seemed slightly better than the 4.5 g/night dose (responders: 41.4 % versus 47.6 % for severity of pain parameter; 48.1% versus 50.8% for FIQ total score) except for the patient global impression of change (PGIc).  No clear dose-response  pattern  was  observed  from  the  BOCF  results.  The  CHMP  scientific  advice  to  explore lower  dose  of  3g/night  in  the  fibromyalgia  population  as  possible  minimum  effective  dose  was  not followed.

To  support  the  dosing  regimens  used  (4.5  g/night  or  6  g/night),  the  MAH  argumentation  can  be summarised as follows:

- Based on  the pharmacology of Xyrem and binding affinity studies, it has been estimated that single doses of at least 2 to 3 g (roughly equivalent to the individual divided doses of the 4.5 g and 6 g/night) were required for sodium oxybate to act as an agonist at GABAB receptors;

-  Previous submitted data suggested that 3 g dose was minimally effective in narcolepsy subjects. At 3g/night, change from baseline in the number of cataplexy attacks was not statistically significant in study OMC-GHB-2. Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase in non-REM sleep was observed in study OMC-SXB-15 where 4.5 g dose was found to be minimally effective.

- Polysomnographic (PSG) data in fibromyalgia subjects showed lesser effect on sleep parameters at the 4.5 g/night dose;

- The selection of 4.5 g and 6 g/night doses for the Phase 2 and 3 controlled studies was based on prior results from two clinical studies demonstrating efficacy of 4.5 and 6 g doses of sodium oxybate in fibromyalgia patients (Scharf et al. 1998a, Scharf et al. 2003) and on clinical data and over 7 years of postmarketing experience in narcolepsy subjects;

- A dose relationship for gastro-intestinal related adverse events was observed in study OMC-GHB-2. However, this  was  not  the  case  for  CNS  related  adverse  events  suggesting  no  additional  benefit  in exploring the lower dose. These AE were considered similar between Xyrem treatment groups (Xyrem 3  g  was  47.1%,  Xyrem 6  g  was  51.5%,  and  Xyrem  9  g  was  54.3%)  and  were  considerably  higher compared to placebo (29.4%).

The  CHMP  did  not  consider  that  the  proposed  dosing  regimen  (4.5  g  or  6  g/night)  was  adequately justified as it is based on an extrapolation from the population presenting narcolepsy to fibromyalgia patients. Although some evidence has been presented by the MAH suggesting that tolerability in terms of CNS adverse events is not likely to be significantly worse with the 4.5 g/night dose compared to a 3 g/night dose (had this dose been tested in a fibromyalgia population), the CHMP still considered that the  minimal  effective  dose  has  not  been  established  and  that  doses  lower  than  4.5  g/night  (e.g.  3 g/night or lower) should have been investigated. During evaluation, the MAH proposed to modify the remove the recommended 6 g/night from the posology for safety reasons (see section 3.5.10)

## Short term efficacy

In two randomised controlled Phase 3 pivotal studies (06-008 and 06-009), of which only one (study 06-009) was double-blind (as the intended masking was insufficient in study 06-008), a statistically and clinically significant difference between 2 doses, i.e. 4.5 g and 6 g/night, of Xyrem and placebo was reported except for the 6g dosing regimen in study 06-008 for FIQ total score (p=0.062). The effect  was  consistent  over  the  primary  and  co-primary  endpoints:    the  proportions  of  patients  who achieved at least 30 % reduction in pain (VAS) were 27.3% (placebo); 46.2% (4.5g dose); 39.3% (6g

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose) for study 06-008 and 20.2 % (placebo); 35.4% (4.5 g dose); 35.3 % (6g dose) for study 06009. The proportions of patients who achieved at least 30 % reduction in FIQ total score (functionality response) were 30.1% (placebo); 46.2% (4.5g dose); 39.3% (6g dose) for study 06-008 and 21.8 % (placebo);  39.5%  (4.5  g  dose);  40.0%  (6g  dose)  for  study  06-009.  Most  of  the  secondary  efficacy results  were  also  consistent.  In  general,  consistent  results  were  also  observed  for  the  different statistical  analyses  (ITT,  BOCF  and  PP)  supporting  of  the  robustness  of  the  data.  Further  LOCF  and MMRM analyses confirmed the results and showed a clearer dose response between 4.5 g/night and 6 g/night.

The primary and co-primary endpoints were selected in line with the CHMP scientific advice. The CHMP noted  that  the  endpoints  chosen  fulfil  the  OMERACT  9  Fibromyalgia  Workshop  recommendations  to study  multiple  core  domains,  including  pain,  tenderness,  fatigue,  patient  global,  multidimensional function,  and  sleep  disturbance  in  all  fibromyalgia  treatment  clinical  studies.  Overall,  the  outcome measures were considered relevant to the indication initially applied for (fibromyalgia).

In  these  studies,  the  distribution  of  the  number  of  patients  who  discontinued  the  study  was  clearly dose  dependent  for  the  reason  'adverse  events'.  Conversely,  the  reason  'lack  of  efficacy'  was  not evident  as  most  patients,  not  surprisingly,  were  derived  from  the  placebo  groups,  but  numerically more patients in the high dose (6 g/night) than in the lower dose (4.5 g/night) dosing groups withdrew for this reason. Further information was provided by the MAH showing that some patients who were randomised to 6 g/night dose  did  discontinue  at  a  dose  of  4.5  g/night  (down  titration  of  dose  was allowed)  and  that  no  dose  relationship  was  observed  in  this  regard.  Most  discontinuations  occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

## Long term efficacy

The uncontrolled, open-label design used in the study was not considered as ideal for the assessment of maintenance of efficacy (and long-term safety). However, the CHMP scientific advice endorsed the use  of  this  design,  and  given  the  difficulties  of  a  long-term  placebo-controlled  study,  both  from  a perspective of feasibility and interpretation, the uncontrolled design is considered to be acceptable.

Although the interim results of the long-term extension study (06-010) indicated that the efficacy of Xyrem seen in the two controlled pivotal studies was maintained over time, the CHMP requested the final analysis during the evaluation.

Overall, response rates at study endpoint by final dose varied for both Pain VAS (from 67.9 to 74.9%) and FIQ Total Score (from 67.3 to 75.9) with no evident dose relationship pattern, which makes the interpretation  of  these  results  difficult.  The  mean  dose  of  Xyrem  appeared  to  increase  over  time suggesting potential cause of tolerance development.

Interestingly,  responder  rates  for  those  patients  originally  randomised  to  the  4.5  g  dose  was  larger than for patients randomised to the 6 g/night dose for both the Pain VAS (77% versus 60.9%) and FIQ total score (77.3%versus 60%).

Considering that patients had been treated for the preceding 14 weeks and the open-label design of the  study,  completion  rates  in  the  extension  study  were  not  impressive:  51%,  61.3%,  58.3%  for placebo, 4.5 g and 6 g Xyrem groups, respectively.

## Extrapolation of US data to EU population

In the short term studies (06-008 and 06-009), the patient distribution between the EU and the US was very skew with a clear preponderance of centres in the US. This was not in line with the CHMP scientific advice, which recommended one of the pivotal trials to be conducted in the EU. In fact, the EU representation was only about a third of the population of one of the trial. In this sub-population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy was not demonstrated. Furthermore, subjects based in the EU displayed markedly less efficacy than subjects from the US.

The proportions of patients who achieved at least 30 % reduction in pain (VAS) in the US were 23.8% (placebo); 43.0% (4.5g dose); 38.3% (6g dose) and the proportions of patients who achieved at least 30 % reduction in FIQ total score (functionality response) were 25.7% (placebo); 45.2% (4.5g dose); 39.9% (6g dose). The proportions of EU patients who achieved at least 30 % reduction in pain (VAS) were  23.4%  (placebo);  30.6%  (4.5g  dose);  31.6%  (6g  dose)  and  the  proportions  of  patients  who achieved at least 30 % reduction in FIQ total score (functionality response) were 26.6% (placebo); 31.8% (4.5g dose); 38.6% (6g dose).

Inferior  efficacy  was  also  reported  for  the  EU  population  as  compared  to  the  US  population  in responder rates analyses for pain VAS and FIQ total score in the long term study (06-010).

The CHMP also noted baseline differences between the US and EU. The severity of the disease judged from the pain VAS, FIQ total score and fatigue VAS was clearly more severe in the EU than in the US population, although the mean and median time since onset of fibromyalgia symptoms were similar. The EU population had higher BDI-II scores suggesting more severe degree of depression than in the US. The CHMP concluded that the results from the US population could not be extrapolated to the EU population and that EU patients may have different disease characteristics than the US population.

However, the MAH argued that there was a high degree of consistency in results for the EU and the US populations. Differences observed in the populations did not seem to be driven by regional differences in diagnosis or treatment practices, but patients with more severe symptoms in terms of fibromyalgia and  depression  appeared  to  be  over-represented  in  the  EU  study  population  i.e  consistent  results across regions were found when patients with moderate to severe depression were excluded from the analysis.  This  may  have  influenced  the  treatment  outcome  in  certain  subgroups,  but  there  is  no indication  that  Xyrem  would  generally  be  less  effective  in  patients  from  the  EU,  i.e.,  these  results allowed for an extrapolation to the population that would be eligible for Xyrem treatment in Europe. Therefore, the MAH proposed to restrict the use in patients without moderate to severe depression.

However, the CHMP considered that the following issues remain to be addressed:

- Inconsistencies between the US and EU population were argued on the basis of post-hoc analysis that identified  co-morbid  depression  as  possible  confounding  factor.  The  robustness  of  these  data  is questioned due to limitation  in  the  design  and  sample  size,  not  supporting  of  the  target  population applied for.

- Results were not consistent for the higher 6 g dose of Xyrem in patients without moderate to severe depression (pain VAS: 28.6% versus 39.0%; FIQ total score: 35.7%versus 40.4%) suggesting that the proposed extrapolation was not valid;

-  The  limitation  of  the  target  population  to  patients  without  moderate  to  severe  depression  is considered a rather impractical and artificial proposal in the context of a disease where a greater or lower degree of depression is almost constant and variable across time. In fact, despite the exclusion criteria for major depression, some patients with BDI-II ≥ 20 were included in the trial suggesting that the proposed restricted use may not well match the population intended to be treated. The fact that EU patients  presented  higher  severity  of  the  disease  and  higher  depression  scores  might  not  be necessarily  a  confounding  factor  but  could  indicate  a  different  perception  of  fibromyalgia  in  the  EU compared to the US and thus support the need for a separate EU study prior approval.

## 3.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The CHMP concluded the following:

-  The proposed dosing regimen (4.5 g/night) was not adequately justified and the minimal effective dose has not been established.

- The short- and long-term efficacy has not been demonstrated in the EU population.

## 3.5. Clinical safety

## 3.5.1. Clinical safety

The safety database comprises short term and long term studies (OMC-SXB-26, 06-008, 06-009 and 06-010) conducted in patients with fibromyalgia.

## 3.5.2. Patient exposure

In Phase 2 and 3 studies (OMC-SXB-26, 06-008, 06-009, and 06-010), 958 subjects with fibromyalgia received Xyrem, including 139 subjects treated for at least 6 months and 76 subjects treated for at least  1 year.  The  present  safety  analysis  used  the  interim  data  for  study  06-010,  a  total  of  161 subjects were ongoing in the study, these subjects were therefore not included in this analysis.

Treatment  duration  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  was  8 weeks  in  OMC-SXB-26  and  14 weeks  in 06-008 and 06-009, with a combined total 61,402 subject-nights of exposure (168 subject-years). The duration of treatment in the open-label extension study 06-010 was up to 38 weeks. The total subjectnights of exposure for subjects who received any dose of Xyrem in the Phase 2 and 3 studies were 101,853 nights (279 subject-years).

## 3.5.3. Adverse events

## 3.5.4. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No  deaths  were  reported.  Among  the  19  sodium  oxybate-treated  subjects  who  had  treatmentemergent  serious  adverse  events,  4  subjects  had  one  or  more  serious  adverse  events  considered related  to  treatment,  (vomiting  in  one  subject,  sleep  paralysis  and  unresponsive  to  stimuli  in  one subject, headache in one subject, and paresthesia and depression in one subject) and 14 subjects had study drug dosing interrupted or discontinued, or discontinued study participation due to the serious adverse events.

At the time of the interim analysis for the long term study, 3 single serious events (not covered in this database due to time of database lock), namely occurrences of transient toxic encephalopathy due to an accidental overdose of Xyrem, an unspecified psychiatric event (mental disorder), and a pseudoobstruction of the small bowel were also reported.

## 3.5.5. Laboratory findings

A  few  changes  in  laboratory  values  were  reported  as  adverse  events;  however,  in  no  case  the incidence exceeded 0.5 %. The incidences of alanine aminotransferase increased, liver function test abnormal,  and  hypercholesterolemia  were  similar  in  the  All  Xyrem  and  placebo  treatment  groups. Anaemia  (0.3%)  and  hypokalemia  (0.2%)  were  the  only  events  that  occurred  in  Xyrem-treated subjects  and  not  in  placebo-treated  subjects.  Adverse  events  from  laboratory  findings  led  to  study discontinuation in two subjects: ketoacidosis in one  subject while receiving Xyrem 7.5 g in 06-010,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased in subject while receiving Xyrem 9 g in 06-010 (associated with an unrelated hepatitis A infection).

## 3.5.6. Other safety findings

## Psychiatric adverse events

The frequency of anxiety was up to three times higher in Xyrem-treated patient compared to patients in the placebo group: 5.9 and 6.7% in the Xyrem groups, respectively;  1.3% in the placebo group. Also depression was more commonly seen in the Xyrem groups than in the placebo group : 1.6 and 1.7% in the Xyrem groups, respectively; 1.1%. For both events, a clear dose-response relationship was observed. Additional analyses were provided by the MAH including full data on study 06-010 and are presented below.

## Anxiety

In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, respectively 5 (1.3%), 22 (5.9%) and 25 (6.7%) subjects reported an adverse event anxiety in the placebo, Xyrem 4.5 g and Xyrem 6 g groups. In about 70% of anxiety events, the onset occurred within six weeks after starting the study treatment in the Xyremtreated subjects.  Half of the anxiety events were reported as mild in the Xyrem-treated subjects and 90% as mild or moderate. Severe events were only observed with the 6 g dose.  More than half of the anxiety events were intermittent in the Xyrem-treated subjects and about one third were reported as continuous.    Thirty-four  percent  of  the  reported  anxiety  adverse  events  led  to  a  discontinuation  of Xyrem treatment, as compared to a slightly higher percentage (40%) in the placebo group. However, the limitation of the small sample sizes in the placebo group should be noted.

Anxiety  was  reported  in  a  larger  proportion  by  subjects  between  50  and  64  years  as  compared  to subjects between 40 and 49 years. No relevant difference in baseline fibromyalgia severity in subjects reporting anxiety as compared to the overall study population was observed.

Anxiety was reported in a larger proportion by subjects with baseline BDI-II scores indicating mild to moderate depression as compared to the overall study population, this effect is more pronounced in the placebo group. This trend was not observed for baseline BDI-II scores indicating severe depression and there was no consistent relationship with the Xyrem doses. There was no evidence that lack of efficacy is more frequent in subjects reporting anxiety as compared to the overall study population.

## Depression

In  the  Phase  3  placebo-controlled studies, respectively 4 (1.1%), 6 (1.6%) and 10 (2.7%) subjects reported an adverse event depression in the placebo, Xyrem 4.5 g, and Xyrem 6 g groups. An adverse event 'major depression' was reported by respectively 2 (0.5%), 2 (0.5%), and 1 (0.3%) subjects in the  placebo,  Xyrem  4.5  g,  and  Xyrem  6  g  groups.  Although  reported  by  few  subjects,  no  doseresponse relationship can be observed for this event. In 60% of depression events, the onset occurred within six weeks after starting the study treatment in the Xyrem-treated subjects. In Xyrem-treated subjects,  45%  of  the  depression  events  were  reported  as  mild  and  95%  as  mild  or  moderate.    In Xyrem-treated subjects, 60% of the depression events was reported as continuous.  Forty percent of the reported depression events led to a discontinuation of Xyrem treatment, as compared to a higher proportion  (67%)  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  the  limitation  of  the  small  sample  sizes  in  the placebo group should be noted.

No  relevant  differences  can  be  observed  regarding  the  age  distribution  of  subjects  who  reported depression and in baseline fibromyalgia severity in subjects reporting depression as compared to the overall study population.   Xyrem-treated subjects who reported depression tend to have higher BDI-II scores at baseline.  Xyrem-treated subjects who reported depression tend to have lower efficacy as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared  to  the  overall  population.  This  is  also  observed  in  the  placebo  group  (except  for  pain response),  however,  the  limitation  of  the  small  sample  sizes  in  the  depression  subgroup  should  be noted.

## Respiratory depression

Dyspnoea  was  the  only  one  of  these  events  that  occurred  in  more  than  one  subject  across  all treatment  groups.  Sleep  apnoea  syndrome  occurred  in  one  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  The percentage occurrence of dyspnoea was highest in the Xyrem 6 g group (1.6%). Of the 12 subjects with dyspnoea events in the Xyrem treatment groups, dyspnoea in one subject in the Xyrem 6 g group was considered  severe.  Dyspnoea  was  considered  related  to  treatment  in  the  placebo  (N=1),  4.5 g dose (N=1) and Xyrem 6 g dose (N=4) groups, respectively. In one subject who was randomized to Xyrem 6 g, dyspnoea, cyanosis (mild and related to treatment), and serious adverse events of sleep paralysis and unresponsive to stimuli occurred after the first dose of 2.25 g during the titration period in 06-008  (i.e., before the dose  increase to 6 g/night); these adverse  events  led to study discontinuation.  One  serious  adverse  event  of  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  was reported in one subject receiving Xyrem 9 g (06-010). This subject had no reported history of COPD. The COPD event (Days 258-265 during treatment with Xyrem 9 g) was considered to be severe and unrelated to treatment. This event led to hospitalization and study drug dosing was interrupted during this event.

## CNS depression

The incidence of dizziness was higher in the Xyrem 6 g (15.5%) and 4.5 g (11.9%) groups compared to the placebo group (2.3%). The incidence of somnolence was highest in the Xyrem 6 g group (5.0%), but similar in the Xyrem 4.5 g (3.2%) and placebo (2.8%) groups; the rates of other events (sedation, lethargy,  depressed  level  of  consciousness,  hangover)  were  similar  across  the  groups  and  did  not exceed 1%.

Of these events potentially related to CNS depression, adverse events of somnolence were considered severe in two subjects in the Xyrem 4.5 g group and one subject in the Xyrem 6 g group. Somnolence was considered related to treatment in the placebo (N=12), Xyrem 4.5 g dose (N=13), and Xyrem 6 g dose (N=20) groups, respectively. Sedation was considered related to treatment in the placebo (N=2), Xyrem 4.5 g dose (N=2), and Xyrem 6 g groups (N=3), respectively.

## Weight changes

In the Phase 3 studies, mean values for body weight at screening were similar among the treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in the placebo group were all increased, with a maximum mean increase  of  0.51  kg  noted  at  Week 12.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  Xyrem  groups  were  all decreased, with maximum mean decreases of -0.75 kg noted at Week 14 in the Xyrem 4.5 g group and  -1.54 kg  noted  at  Week 12  in  the  Xyrem  6 g  group.  The  trend  of  mean  decrease  over  time continued  in  the  cohort  of  subjects  who  participated  in  06-010,  with  a  maximum  mean  decrease of -4.42 kg observed at Week 46. The rate of decrease from baseline appeared to plateau after Week 38.  Adverse  events  related  to  body  weight  and  appetite  occurred  at  the  following  rates:  weight decreased  3.7%,  decreased  appetite  3.3%,  anorexia  2.9%,  increased  appetite  2.0%,  and  weight increased 1.2%.

## Abuse

The abuse potential has not been elucidated in patients with fibromyalgia, likely to be more fragile than the  narcolepsy  population.  Limited  published  data  investigated  the  abuse  liability  of  Xyrem.  A  risk between  that  of  benzodiazepines  and  barbiturates  is  stated.  However,  these  brief  reviews  were considered insufficient to address this matter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.5.7. Safety in special populations

## Gender, Race

By age category, subjects ≥ 65 years of age (N=41) had a higher incidence of adverse events overall (92.7%)  and  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  (31.7%)  than  subjects  &lt;65  years  of  age.  No subject ≥ 65 years of age experienced a serious adverse event, compared to 2.1% in the younger age group.  The  incidence  of  the  most  frequent  treatment-related  adverse  events  was  similar  in  both subgroups, except that no subject ≥ 65 years of age reported vomiting.

By gender, the incidence of adverse events overall was comparable between males (N=85; 76.5%) and females (N=873; 83.7%). Discontinuations due to adverse events were higher in female subjects (55.9% and 26.2%, respectively) than in male subjects (42.4% and 14.1%, respectively), while the incidence of serious adverse events was similar in males (2.4%) and females (1.9%).

By race, the incidence of adverse events and treatment-related adverse events overall was comparable between the two subgroups. The percentage of discontinuations due to adverse events was higher in Caucasians (N=877) than non-Caucasians (N=81; 26.2% and 13.6%, respectively).

## Pregnancy

Three out of the six reported pregnancies during fibromyalgia trials resulted in spontaneous abortions reported in the fibromyalgia Trials. None of the spontaneous abortions were judged to be related to medication.

## 3.5.8. Discontinuation due to adverse events

In studies 06-008 and 06-009, 19.4% of subjects in the All Xyrem group discontinued due to adverse events  compared  to  8.1%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  When  the  Phase  3  placebo-controlled studies  were  summarized  by  randomized  dose,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to  study discontinuation  was  17.0% in  the  Xyrem  4.5  g  group  and  21.8%  in  the  Xyrem  6  g  group.  Adverse events  leading  to  discontinuation  in ≥ 2% of the All Xyrem group in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies  were  nausea  (3.3%),  headache  (2.8%),  vomiting  (2.4%),  and  dizziness  (2.1%).  The  most common  events  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  placebo  group  were  depression  (1.1%)  and somnolence (0.8%).

## 3.5.9. Post marketing experience

As part of post-marketing evaluation program (PMEP) designed to prospectively capture safety data on the first 1,000 patients receiving Xyrem post approval in the US, a total of 928 reports were received, representing 692 patients. Of those reports, 64% reported no adverse event. The ten most commonly reported  adverse  events  from  solicited  and  spontaneous  reports  were  nausea,  vomiting,  feeling abnormal, headache, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, anxiety, confusional state, initial insomnia, and insomnia. After data from nearly 700 patients were collected, the PMEP requirement was terminated because of the lack of any new or significant findings and the difficulty in collecting physician responses.

## 3.5.10. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety database for patients with fibromyalgia is below the 1500 exposures recommended by the CHMP scientific advice. This is of concern since this patient population is often prone to adverse events resulting from various drugs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 62.3 % of patients in the placebo group, 78.5% in the 4.5 g/night dosing group, and 81.1 % in the 6 g/night group had adverse events. Headache, nausea, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, anxiety, nasopharyngitis,  somnolence,  and  fatigue  were  the  most  common  adverse  events.  Importantly,  the incidence  was  greater  for  active  than  placebo  treatment  and  the  incidence  for  the  6 g  group  was greater than for the 4.5 g group. Therefore the CHMP considered that the posology recommendation to use dose up to 6g/day for patients with severe symptoms was not acceptable and the MAH modified the initial proposed posology accordingly.

Of most concern are the reported psychiatric and respiratory depression related adverse events. For both events, a clear dose-response relationship was observed. This is a significant concern considering that fibromyalgia patients are a vulnerable patient population that often exhibits depressive symptoms. Further analyses were provided by the MAH and led to SmPC changes. These included updating the warning on neuropsychiatric events, adding 'sleep apnea' as adverse drug reaction with a warning as well  as  contraindicating  Xyrem  in  patients  with  major  depression.  A  recommendation  that  Xyrem treatment should be assessed six weeks after its initiation was also proposed in line with the onset of most of the reported anxiety and depression events (about 70% and 60%, respectively).

Regarding pregnancies, three out of the six reported pregnancies during fibromyalgia trials resulted in spontaneous abortions. None of the spontaneous abortions were judged to be related to medication. The  CHMP recommended updating the information in the SmPC to include that data from a limited number  of  pregnant  women  exposed  in  the  first  trimester  indicated  a  possible  risk  of  spontaneous abortions. However, no other relevant epidemiological data are available to date.

Overall the CHMP considered that the safety profile for Xyrem in the fibromyalgia population remains unfavourable due to the high frequency of CNS related adverse events.

In  addition,  the  abuse  potential  has  not  been  elucidated  in  patients  with  fibromyalgia.  The  CHMP considered that this risk remains a concern in this population.

The MAH disagreed with the CHMP's view for the reasons outlined below:

- Abuse liability of sodium oxybate in drug abusers is comparable to other sedative drugs ( European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other drugs, ESPAD data )

-  Non  drug  abusers  do  not  report  positive  subjective  effects  after  administration  of  sodium  oxybate ( Carter et al, 2009 )

- Abuse of GHB is low and has been trending downward in the US; introduction of Xyrem to the market did not increase any indicators of abuse.

Having considered the MAH argumentation, the CHMP still considered that the safety profile remain unfavourable  in  the  population  with  fibromyalgia  due  to  the  high  frequency  of  CNS  related  adverse events and abuse potential. As the safety information resulting from this assessment is relevant to the currently  authorised  indication,  the  SmPC  have  been  amended  accordingly  (see  section  3.8  for  full details).

## 3.5.11. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The CHMP concluded the following:

-  The safety profile for Xyrem in the fibromyalgia population is unfavourable due to the high frequency of CNS related adverse events;
-  The abuse potential for Xyrem remains a concern in the fibromyalgia population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Despite the negative outcome for the extension of indication, as a result of the assessment of the new data, the CHMP recommended the update of the SmPC, as described in section 3.8.

## 3.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  MAH  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

## User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3.7. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

-  Beneficial effects

Overall, the development program of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) provided evidence of short term efficacy in patients with fibromyalgia. This evidence was primarily based on two phase 3 trials (studies 06-008 and 06-009), which together randomized 1121 subjects of whom 371 received placebo, 377 received Xyrem 4.5 g/night and 373 received 6 g/night, respectively. As no pharmacotherapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia currently exists in the EU, approval of a drug would be advantageous for the patients.

In these pivotal studies, of which only one (study 06-009) was double-blind (as the intended masking was insufficient in study 06-008), a statistically and clinically significant difference between 2 doses, i.e. 4.5 g and 6 g/night, of Xyrem and placebo was reported except for the 6g dosing regimen in study 06-008  (p=0.062  for  FIQ  total  score).  The  effect  was  consistent  over  the  primary  and  co-primary endpoints which were selected in line with the CHMP scientific advice:  the proportions of patients who achieved  at  least  30  %  reduction  in  pain  (VAS  score)  were  27.3%  (placebo);  46.2%  (4.5g  dose); 39.3% (6g dose) for study 06-008 and 20.2 %(placebo); 35.4 %(4.5 g dose); 35.3% (6g dose) for study  06-009.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  at  least  30  %  reduction  in  FIQ  total  score (functionality response) were 30.1% (placebo); 46.2 %(4.5g dose); 39.3% (6g dose) for study 06-008 and 21.8% (placebo); 39.5% (4.5 g dose); 40.0% (6g dose) for study 06-009.

There is considerable concordance between the results of the primary and secondary endpoints. These findings provided confidence in a robust and reliable outcome. The 30 % threshold has earlier been identified as a clinically relevant change in pain VAS and FIQ total score. The observed outcome is, thus,  considered  valuable  from  a  clinical  perspective  for  the  fibromyalgia  study  population.  Further LOCF  and  MMRM  analyses  confirmed  the  results  and  showed  a  clearer  dose  response  between  4.5 g/night and 6 g/night.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

The results of the long-term extension study (06-010) suggested that the efficacy of Xyrem seen in the two controlled pivotal studies was maintained over time, but the data is limited to one year. In a very small number of cases there is a tendency for an increase of dose to 9 g/night which cannot exclude completely the development of tolerance.

The  CHMP  did  not  consider  that  the  proposed  initial  dosing  regimen  (4.5  g  or  6  g/night)  was adequately justified as it  is  based  on  an  extrapolation  from  the  population  presenting  narcolepsy  to fibromyalgia  patients.  Although  some  evidence  has  been  presented  by  the  MAH  suggesting  that tolerability in terms of CNS adverse events is not likely to be significantly worse with the 4.5 g/night dose compared to a 3 g/night dose (had this dose been tested in a fibromyalgia population), the CHMP still considered that the minimal effective dose has not been established and that doses lower than 4.5 g/night (e.g. 3 g/night or lower) should have been investigated.

Results from sub-analyses in the EU study population suggested markedly lower responder rates and effect sizes compared to the US population, both in the short term and in the long term studies. The EU representation was only about a third of the population of one of the pivotal trial.

Baseline differences were also observed between the US and EU. The severity of the disease judged from the pain VAS, FIQ total score and fatigue VAS was clearly more severe in the EU than in the US population, although the mean and median time since onset of fibromyalgia symptoms were similar. The EU population had higher BDI-II scores suggesting more severe degree of depression than in the US. The CHMP concluded that the results from the US population could not be extrapolated to the EU population and that EU patients may have different disease characteristics than the US population.

## Risks

-  Unfavourable effects

Considering  that  fibromyalgia  patients  often  exhibit  psychiatric  symptoms,  the  observed  higher frequency of anxiety in Xyrem-treated patients compared to patients in the placebo group (5.9 and 6.7% versus. 1.3%) were of concern. Also depression was more commonly seen in the Xyrem groups than in the placebo group (1.6 and 1.7% versus. 1.1%).

Xyrem treatment discontinuation  related  to  AEs  was  19.4%  versus  8.1%  in  the  active  and  placebo groups, respectively.

-  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

Possible withdrawal/rebound phenomena have not been investigated comprehensively.

The abuse potential of Xyrem is considered an important concern. Only limited long-term safety data have been provided. This is a particular concern with respect to the potential abuse liability and risk of dependence associated with Xyrem when used chronically in the fibromyalgia population. Thus, this risk remains a concern in this population.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

-  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Short and long term effects versus placebo were considered clinically relevant in the overall population that  included  mostly  US  patients.  However,  no  minimal  effective  dose  has  been  established  and  a beneficial outcome has not been demonstrated in EU patient population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects  based  in  the  EU  displayed  markedly  less  efficacy  than  subjects  from  the  US  in  several analyses. Despite consistent results observed for the recommended 4.5g dose in a non prospectively defined subgroup of patients without moderate to severe depression, the extrapolation of the US data to the EU population was not considered valid in this population. The clinical data suggested that EU patients may have different disease characteristics than the US population.

Limited  safety  data  are  available  in  the  population  with  fibromyalgia.  The  clear  dose-response relationship that was observed for anxiety and depression related adverse events further emphasized the need for an adequate dose finding study. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the high incidence of CNS related adverse events remains a concern with a significant impact on the benefit-risk balance.

In addition, the abuse potential for Xyrem remains a concern in the fibromyalgia population.

-  Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance for Xyrem is negative in the EU population with fibromyalgia.

## 3.8. Product Information

Having considered the CHMP assessment on the benefit-risk balance of Xyrem in the EU population with  fibromyalgia,  the  MAH  proposed  to  revise  the  Product  Information,  removing  their  proposal  to include  the  indication  initially  applied  for  and  maintaining  the  changes  relevant  to  the  authorised indication.  The CHMP recommended the update of the SmPC. The revised SmPC proposal is described below (new text underlined, deleted text= strikethrough):

## Section 4.2

Due to the well known potential of abuse of sodium oxybate, physicians should evaluate patients for a history of or susceptibility to drug abuse prior to commencing treatment. During treatment, patients should be monitored for the risk of diversion, misuse and abuse of sodium oxybate (see section 4.4).

If  the  patient  stops  taking  the  medicinal  product  medication  for  more  than  14  consecutive  days, titration should be restarted from the lowest dose.

## Section 4.3

## Patients with major depression

## Section 4.4

## Respiratory depression

Sodium  oxybate  also  has  the  potential  to  induce  respiratory  depression.  Apnoea  and  respiratory depression have been observed in a fasting healthy subject after a single intake of 4.5 g (twice the recommended  starting  dose).  Patients  should  be  questioned  regarding  signs  of  Central  Nervous System  (CNS)  or  respiratory  depression.    Special  caution  should  be  observed  in  patients  with  an underlying  respiratory  disorder.  Because  of  the  higher  risk  of  sleep  apnoea,  patients  with  a  BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 should be monitored closely when taking sodium oxybate.

## Abuse potential and dependence

Sodium oxybate, which is as the sodium salt of GHB, is a CNS depressant active substance with well known  abuse  potential.  Prior  to  treatment  Pphysicians  should  evaluate  patients  for  a  history  of  or susceptibility to drug abuse. Patients should be routinely monitoredclosely and in the case of suspected abuse, treatment with sodium oxybate should be discontinued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Neuropsychiatric events

Patients may become confused while being treated with sodium oxybate. If this occurs, they should be evaluated fully, and appropriate intervention considered on an individual basis. Other neuropsychiatric events include anxiety, psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations, and agitation. The emergence of thought disorders  and/or  behavioural  abnormalities  when  patients  are  treated  with  sodium  oxybate  requires careful and immediate evaluation.

The  emergence  of  depression  when  patients  are  treated  with  sodium  oxybate  requires  careful  and immediate evaluation. Patients with a previous history of a depressive illness and/or suicide attempt should  be  monitored  especially  carefully  for  the  emergence  of  depressive  symptoms  while  taking sodium oxybate. Major depression is contraindicated for use with Xyrem (section 4.3).

## Section 4.5

Drug  interaction  studies  in  healthy  adults  demonstrated  no  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between sodium  oxybate  and  protriptyline  hydrochloride  (an  antidepressant),  zolpidem  tartrate  (a  hypnotic), and  modafinil  (a  stimulant).  However,  pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  these  medicinal  products have not been assessed.

## Sedative hypnotics

Drug interaction studies in healthy adults with sodium oxybate (single dose of 2.25 g) and lorazepam (an  anxiolytic  [benzodiazepine];  single  dose  of  2  mg)  and  zolpidem  tartrate  (a  hypnotic  [nonbenzodiazepine];  single  dose  of  5  mg)  demonstrated  no  pharmacokinetic  interactions.  Increased sleepiness was observed after concomitant administration of sodium oxybate (2.25 g) and lorazepam (2 mg). The pharmacodynamic interaction with zolpidem has not been assessed. When higher doses up to 9 g/d of sodium oxybate are combined with higher doses of hypnotics (within the recommended dose  range)  pharmacodynamic  interactions  associated  with  symptoms  of  CNS  depression  and/or respiratory depression cannot be excluded (see section 4.3).

## Tramadol

A drug interaction study in healthy adults with sodium oxybate (single dose of 2.25 g) and tramadol (a central  acting  opioid;  single  dose  of  100  mg)  demonstrated  no  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction.  When  higher  doses  up  to  9  g/d  of  sodium  oxybate  are  combined  with  higher  doses  of opioids (within the recommended  dose  range) pharmacodynamic  interactions associated with symptoms of CNS depression and/or respiratory depression cannot be excluded (see sections 4.3).

## Antidepressants

Drug  interaction  studies  in  healthy  adults  demonstrated  no  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between sodium  oxybate  (single  dose  of  2.25  g)  and  the  antidepressants  protriptyline  hydrochloride  (single dose  of  10  mg)  and  duloxetine  (60  mg  at  steady  state).  No  additional  effect  on  sleepiness  was observed when comparing single doses of sodium oxybate alone (2.25 g) and sodium oxybate (2.25 g) in  combination  with  duloxetine  (60  mg  at  steady  state).  Antidepressants  have  been  used  in  the treatment of cataplexy. A possible additive effect of antidepressants and sodium oxybate cannot be excluded.  The  rate  of  adverse  events  has  increased  when  sodium  oxybate  is  co-administered  with tricyclic antidepressants.

## Modafinil

A  drug  interaction  study  in  healthy  adults  demonstrated  no  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between sodium oxybate (single dose of 4.5 g) and modafinil (a stimulant; single dose of 200 mg). Sodium oxybate  has  been  administered  concomitantly  with  CNS  stimulant  agents  in  approximately  80%  of patients in clinical studies in narcolepsy. Whether this affected respiration during the night is unknown.

## Section 4.6

## Pregnancy

Animal studies have shown no evidence of teratogenicity but embryolethality was seen in both rat and rabbit studies (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no adequate data on the use of sodium oxybate during the first trimester of pregnancy.Data from a limited number of pregnant women exposed in the first trimester indicate a possible increased risk of spontaneous abortions. To date no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Limited data from pregnant patients during second and third trimester indicate no malformative nor foeto/neonatal toxicity of sodium oxybate.

## Breastfeeding

It is not known whether sodium oxybate and/or its metabolites is  are excreted into breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended when treatingduring treatment with sodium oxybate.

## Section 5.2

Sodium oxybate is rapidly and almost but incompletely absorbed after oral administration; absorption is delayed and decreased by a high fat meal.  It is eliminated mainly by metabolism with a half-life of 0.5 to 1 hour.  Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear with the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) versus time curve increasing 3.8-fold as dose is doubled from 4.5 g to 9 g. The pharmacokinetics are not altered with repeat dosing.

Absorption : Sodium oxybate is absorbed rapidly following oral administration with an absolute bioavailability of about 88 %25 %.

## Special populations:

Elderly patients : The pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate in patients greater than the age of 65 years have  not  been  studied.  In  a  limited  number  of  patients  greater  than  the  age  of  65  years  the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate was not different compared to patients younger than 65 years of age.

## Section 5.3

Drug  discrimination  studies  show  that  GHB  produces  a  unique  discriminative  stimulus  that  in  some respects  is  similar  to  that  of  alcohol,  morphine  and  certain  GABA-mimetic  medicinal  products.  Selfadministration studies in rats, mice and monkeys have produced conflicting results, whereas tolerance to  GHB  as  well  as  cross-tolerance  to  alcohol  and  baclofen  have  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  in rodents.

The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly.

The CHMP considered the above-mentioned changes to be acceptable.

## 4. Conclusion

The  MAH  submitted  a  Type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  as  follows: 'Xyrem  is  indicated  in adults: Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of fibromyalgia.'

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                                 | Type   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a                | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

On the basis of the data provided, the CHMP did not support the extension of the indication. However, as a result of the evaluation of the new data, the CHMP recommends to update the SmPC and the Package Leaflet accordingly.

On 17 March 2011 the CHMP considered the variation:

'Update  of  relevant  sections  of  the  SmPC  to  include  the  following  information  relevant  to  the authorised indication: contraindication in patients with major depression (4.3), information on drug-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug  interactions  with  duloxetine,  lorazepam  and  tramadol  (4.5),  pharmacokinetic  results  in  elderly population  (5.2)  and  safety  information  in  relation  to  the  clinical  trials  conducted  in  fibromyalgia patients (4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8). Information on absolute bioavailability and preclinical data were also updated in section 5.2, and 5.3, respectively. Package leaflet updated accordingly.

Annex  II  has  been  updated  in  order  to  delete  the  reference  to  the  versions  of  the  RMP  and Pharmacovigilance system and to reflect the previously agreed yearly PSUR cycle.'

to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics , Package Leaflet and Annex II.
