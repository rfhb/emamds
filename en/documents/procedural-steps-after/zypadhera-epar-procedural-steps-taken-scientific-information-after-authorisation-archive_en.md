| II/0018 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC to remove the requirement for patient accompaniment following the administration of Zypadhera, to update the information on post-injection syndrome, and to reinforce instructions for physicians to check for symptoms of post injection syndrome before the patient leaves the health care facility. The Package Leaflet and Annex II have been updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/02/2013 | 27/05/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | There has been no confirmed post-injection-syndrome event that has occurred more than 3 hours after the injection since the marketing of Zypadhera. As the majority of post-injection syndrome events occur within 1 hour of receiving the injection of Zypadhera and the patients are observed for 3 hours after receiving the injection, the chances of a post-injection event occurring in the period after leaving the health care facility and while the patient is being accompanied to their destination can be seen to be very low. Therefore, the requirement for doctors or nurses to ensure that patients will not travel alone to their destination after injection has been removed. |

| II/0004 | Update of the section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to include a warning on sudden cardiac death. In addition, section 4.8 is also updated to include urinary incontinence as an uncommon adverse drug reaction and to revise the information on elevated plasma prolactin concentrations and related clinical manifestations. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. Details of the local representative in Spain were updated in the Package Leaflet. Additionally, the incidence of post-injection syndrome was updated in section 4.4 and editorial changes were made in the relevant sections of the Product Information. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 19/11/2009 | 21/12/2009 | SmPC and PL | Following review of the latest safety information for olanzapine provided by the MAH on sudden cardiac death, urinary incontinence, elevated plasma prolactin concentrations and related clinical manifestations and post- injection syndrome, the CHMP considered that: - In postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the events of sudden cardiac death have been reported in patients with olanzapine.In a retrospective observational cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden cardiac death in patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice the risk in patients not using antipsychotics. In the study, the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of atypical antipsychotics included in a pooled analysis. Subsequently, this information was reflected as a warning in section 4.4. - Two apparently unconfounded serious case reports, and 13 serious case reports of urinary incontinence with a positive dechallenge were reported in PSUR 23. According to the current SPC, olanzapine exhibits a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) including ?1-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore; in the clinical trial data (from adult placebo- controlled database) the frequency of urinary incontinence with olanzapine was 0.3% (i.e., uncommon). Subsequently, urinary incontinence was added in section 4.8 as uncommon ADR. - In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of normal range in approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with normal baseline prolactin value. In the majority of these patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained |

| II/0002 | Update of the section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to provide further detailed information on the risk of weight gain following CHMP conclusions on additional analyses performed by the MAH. Safety information on glucose levels observed during long term exposure was also updated. Editorial change was made in section 4.4 of the SPC. Furthermore, section 6.6 of the SPC and relevant section of the Package Leaflet were amended following CHMP review on the information related to instructions for use of the needles. Changes to the Product Information in line with latest QRD templates were also made. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 29/05/2009 | 27/07/2009 | SmPC and PL | Following further analyses related to weight, lipids, and glucose for two populations (elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, or Parkinson's disease; and patients who were naïve to antipsychotic treatment when they entered the relevant clinical trials) and additional weight analyses from 2 clinical studies (F1D-US- HGJU and F1D-HGGF) performed by the MAH, the CHMP recommended that an update of the SPC should be made in relation to the wording on weight gain in section 4.8 to provide better information for prescribers. The CHMP recommended that the frequency of potentially clinically significant weight gain should be clarified as proportions of patients in each class (over 7%, over 15% and over 25% weight gain) in short term use (under 24 weeks) and long term use (over 24 weeks), separately. In line with the CHMP's recommendations, the MAH updated footnotes 1 and 9 as follows: Adults Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Following short term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain ? 7% of baseline body weight was very common (22.2%), ? |
