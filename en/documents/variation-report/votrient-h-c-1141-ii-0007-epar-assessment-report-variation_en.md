## 2. Scientific Discussion

## 2.1Introduction

Soft  Tissue  Sarcoma  (STS)  is  a  rare,  heterogeneous  group  of  connective  tissue  cancers  originating from mesenchymal cells and their precursors. There are multiple histopathological subtypes of STS. Current conventions often group these subtypes under the general rubric of 'STS' for the purpose of treatment,  although  new  treatment  options  are  increasingly  directed  more  specifically  at  individual histopathological subtypes.

STS  accounts  for  less  than  1%  of  all  new  malignancies  in  adults,  and  2%  of  total  cancer-related mortality [Fletcher, 2002; Altekruse, 2009].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Surgery is usually the first line of management for localized STS. Standard treatment is generally a wide surgical  excision  or  even  more  radical  surgery  of  the  primary  tumour  combined  with  adjuvant radiotherapy  in  selected  cases.  The  addition  of  post-operative  radiotherapy  may  reduce  the  rate  of local recurrence [Leibel, 1982].

Optimal  local  treatment  of  STS  tumours  does  not  prevent  the  occurrence  of  distant  metastases  in many patients, especially those with high-grade tumours. STS metastasizes primarily to the lungs, but also to liver, bone and other organs, depending on the subtype. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is  widely  used  in  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  (unresectable)  and  metastatic  STS.  With  the exception of the chemosensitive small round cell tumours such as Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours and rhabdomyosarcoma, as well as osteosarcomas, some of which are potentially curable even when metastatic, virtually all other patients with metastatic STS are destined to die from their disease no matter how aggressive their management [Kriekelis, 2010].

Treatment  options  for  second  line  treatment  usually  comprise  (previously  un-used)  ifosfamide  or, sometimes, dacarbazine. Other options include pegylated doxorubicin, epirubicin, taxanes or gemcitabine. Combination regimens (frequently involving doxorubicin or gemcitabine) are considered when the clinical condition of the patient as well as the histology of the tumour provides arguments for such choice.

Pazopanib  monohydrochloride  is  an  orally  bioavailable  multi-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  of  vascular endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  (VEGFR)-1,  VEGFR-2,  VEGFR-3,  platelet-derived  growth  factor receptor (PDGFR)α and  β ,  fibroblast  growth factor receptor (FGFR) -1 and -3, the stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit), interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck),  and  the  transmembrane  CSF1  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (c-Fms).  The  recommended  dose  of pazopanib is 800 mg once daily.

Votrient (pazopanib) was first authorised in the EU on 04 June 2010.  Based on available data at the time of the application, pazopanib was granted a conditional marketing authorisation as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and for patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease.

Glaxo Group Ltd submitted an application for a type II variation in July 2011 to extend the indication of Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced STS and proposed to add the following wording in the current indication:

## 'Votrient is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy, or for patients who are unsuited for such therapy.

## The  Phase  III  trial  population  excluded  patients  with  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST)  or adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma.'

With  the  MAH's  response  to  the  second  RSI  (request  for  supplementary  information),  the  proposed indication has been amended as follows:

Votrient is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy.

Efficacy and safety has only been established in certain STS histological tumour subtypes (see section 5.1) ''.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

No new data related to pharmaceutical quality were submitted with this variation application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.3 Non clinical aspects

## 2.3.1 Introduction

The  non-clinical  studies  submitted  by  the  MAH  included  a  liposarcoma  xenograft  study,  an  in  vitro transport study, an oral 8 day toxicity study in rats and three toxicity studies in juvenile rats.

## 2.3.2 Pharmacology

The effect of pazopanib on growth of human liposarcoma (SW-872) has been examined in xenograft in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) Mice.

SCID  mice  (10 ♂ /group)  were  inoculated  with  human  liposarcoma  cells.  When  the  tumour  volume reached about 100 - 200 mm 3 , the mice were treated orally with pazopanib (100 mg/kg/day once daily or 30, 100 mg/kg/day twice daily) for 21 days.

When compared to the vehicle control, pazopanib significantly inhibited the tumour growth from day 8 until  the  end  of  treatment  (measured  as  both  tumour  volume  and  weight)  for  all  three  treatment regimes. Reductions in body weight were observed in all dose groups starting on Day 3, although body weight gain was evident from Day 8. Mice dosed pazopanib at 100 mg/kg BID showed stabilization in body  weight  reduction  after  Day  12.  At  Day  22,  body  weight  was  lowest  in  the  animals  dosed pazopanib at 100 mg/kg BID. Doses of 30 mg/kg BID or 100 mg/kg pazopanib QD or BID significantly inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner, starting from Day 8. At Day 21, inhibition at 30 mg/kg BID or 100 mg/kg pazopanib QD or BID was 52, 49 and 67%, respectively (data not shown).

## 2.3.3 Pharmacokinetics

An in vitro study using sandwich-cultured rat or human hepatocytes was conducted to investigate the inhibition  of  the  sodium-taurocholate  co-transporting  polypeptide  (NTCP)  and  bile  salt  export  pump (BSEP) by pazopanib and its metabolites GSK1268992 and GSK1268997. The three compounds had minimal  effects  on  taurocholate  disposition  in  human  hepatocytes.  In  rat  hepatocytes,  all  three compounds reduced taurocholate uptake by approximately 33-44% at 30 μ M (data not shown).

## 2.3.4 Toxicology

## Repeat-dose toxicity

The hepatotoxicity of pazopanib was evaluated in an investigative study (RD2010-00192) conducted in Sprague Dawley SD rats (6 ♂ /group) following 8-days of oral dosing of the monohydrochloride salt of pazopanib (500 mg/kg/day expressed as parent compound). The following endpoints/parameters were evaluated: clinical observations, body weights, food consumption measurements, clinical chemistry results (from pre-treatment Days 2, 4 and 8), microscopic observations (three lobes of the liver), hepatic gene expression analysis (lateral lobe), and toxicokinetics (treated animals only). The findings are summarised in Table 1.

Toxicokinetics

Based on the results, mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and total bile acids occurred in rats given 500 mg/kg/day. There were  no  histopathology  findings  in  hepatocytes  or  biliary  epithelium  to  correlate  with  the  clinical chemistry findings. However, vascular effects were observed in intrahepatic branches of the hepatic artery and arterioles near the liver hilus in all rats given 500 mg/kg/day.

The toxicokinetic data of study RD2010-00192 and the comparison with toxicokinetic parameters in human are summarised in Table 2.

a Due  to  mortality  and  marked  decreases  in  body  weight  gain  among  the  group,  the  300  mg/kg/day  group  was given a drug holiday for 4 days and resumed dosing at 100 mg/kg/day for the study duration.

## 2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An updated ERA has been submitted by the MAH as part of this application.

##  Phase I

## PECsurfacewater

Based on the maximum daily dose of 800 mg/day, the MAH has calculated PECsurfacewater values using both the default Fpen of 0.01 and a refined Fpen. Using the default Fpen of 0.01, the PECsurfacewater becomes  0.4 μ g/L,  which  is  well  above  the  action  limit  of  0.01 μ g/L.  When  an  Fpen  based  on  the prevalence of RCC (3.12 x 10 -4 ) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.12 μ g/L.  Assuming all patients are treated with the prescribed dose for 365 days/year, results in a PECsurfacewater with the same value. When an Fpen based on the estimated yearly consumption (4.46 x 10 10  mg/year) and the defined daily dose (DDD, 1250 mg) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.08 μ g/L.

## PBT assessment

The MAH has performed an OECD 302C test and OECD 107 test in order to determine the inherent biodegradability and the log Kow for pazopanib, respectively. Pazopanib was determined to be not inherently biodegradable and is thus considered a potential persistent substance. Using the currently reported log Kow values the ion-corrected low Dow of pazopanib was determined to be 2.26, 3.33 and 3.92 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively.

## Phase II

The results for the phase II-Tier A assessment for pazopanib are summarized in table 4:

a  Based on geometric mean measured concentrations:

The PECgroundwater is based on the PECsurfacewater . Using the PECsurfacewater of 4 μ g/L based on a worst case scenario, the PECgroundwater becomes 1 μ g/L.

PECsurfacewater /PNECmicro-ogranisms =  4 μ g/L  /  100,000 μ g/L  =  4.0  x  10 -5 .  This  ratio  is  lower  than  the trigger ratio of 0.1.

PECsurfacewater/PNECwater = 4 μ g/L / 15 μ g/L = 0.27. This ratio is lower than the trigger ratio of 1.

PECgroundwater /PNECgroundwater = 1 μ g/L / 15 μ g/L = 0.067. This ratio is lower than the trigger ratio of 1.

In addition, based on the reported Koc value of 2.35, studies for the terrestrial environment are not necessary.

## 2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The MAH has submitted one in vivo pharmacodynamic study, one in vitro pharmacokinetic study, one investigative repeat-dose toxicity study and three juvenile repeat-dose toxicity studies.

The  liposarcoma  xenograft  study  supports  the  use  of  pazopanib  in  the  treatment  of  sarcoma malignancies.  However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  predictive  value  of  mouse  xenograft  models  for clinical efficacy is rather limited.

Two  studies  (one  in  vitro  kinetic  study  and  one  8  days  repeated-dose  toxicity)  were  performed  to elucidate  the  possible  mechanism  involved  in  the  hepatotoxicity  seen  in  clinical  and  non-clinical studies.  Neither  study  provided  evidence  about  the  mechanism  involved  in  the  hepatic  enzyme alterations observed following pazopanib treatment.

In juvenile toxicity studies, when rats were dosed from day 9 post partum through day 21 postpartum, pazopanib caused mortalities and abnormal organ growth/maturation in kidney, lung, liver and heart, at  a  dose  approximately  0.1 times  the  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC  in  adult  humans.  When  rats were dosed from day 21 post partum to day 62 post partum, toxicologic findings were similar to adult rats  at  comparable  exposures.  Human  paediatric  patients  are  at  increased  risk  for  bone  and  teeth effects  as  compared  to  adults,  as  these  changes,  including  inhibition  of  growth  (shortened  limbs), fragile  bones  and  remodelling  of  teeth,  were  present  in  juvenile  rats  at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day  (equal  to approximately 0.1-0.2 times the clinical exposure based on AUC in adult humans. The section 5.3 of the SmPC has been updated to include the above information on juvenile toxicity studies.

An  update  of  the  original  environmental  assessment  taking  into  account  both  indications  (the metastatic renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma) has been provided by the MAH.

Overall the ERA is considered acceptable. However the CHMP recommended the MAH to perform a water sediment study (OECD 308) to determine the effects on sediment organisms. Furthermore, using the currently reported log Kow values the ion-corrected low Dow of pazopanib was determined to be 2.26, 3.33 and 3.92 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Based on that, the CHMP recommended the MAH to perform a bioconcentration study (OECD 305).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.4.1 Pharmacokinetics / Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacokinetic data was collected in supportive Phase II study VEG20002. Serial blood samples for analysis of plasma pazopanib were collected at the Day 29 visit. A blood sample for analysis of plasma pazopanib was also collected prior to pazopanib administration on Days 57 and Day 85. The results are presented in Table 5.

## 2.4.2 Conclusion on Clinical Pharmacology

The difference between the mean pre-dose plasma pazopanib concentrations on Day 29 and Day 85 was less than 5%. Although the data presented regarding the PK of pazopanib in STS are limited, no difference  in  pazopanib  plasma  concentrations  evaluated  at  the  same  time  points  were  observed between STS and RCC patients. Moreover, the pazopanib plasma concentrations measured in study VEG20002 employing pazopanib 800 mg once daily were ≥ 20 g/ml in more than 70% of patients. This threshold concentration has been correlated with pharmacodynamic markers such as hypertension and soluble VEGFR2 inhibition, and with efficacy in RCC.

## 2.5 Clinical efficacy

The data in the current application are mainly from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase III trial (VEG110727) comparing pazopanib to placebo in patients with metastatic STS with confirmed disease progression during or following therapy. It is supported by data from a phase II study (VEG20002) of pazopanib in advanced and/or metastatic STS that was refractory or relapsed. A summary of both pivotal and supportive studies is presented in Table 6.

## 2.5.1 Main study

## VEG110727 study

This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study  designed  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib compared to placebo in patients with STS whose disease had progressed during or following prior chemotherapy.

## Methods

## Study Participants

The  study  population  included  patients  with  histological  evidence  of  high  or  intermediate  grade malignant STS, or cytological evidence in case of presence of multiple metastases. Low grade tumours were allowed provided there was evidence of disease progression.

Eligible  histology  subtypes  included  fibroblastic  (adult  fibrosarcoma,  myxofibrosarcoma,  sclerosing epithelioid  fibrosarcoma,  malignant  solitary  fibrous  tumours),  so-called  fibrohistiocytic  (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), giant cell MFH, inflammatory MFH), leiomyosarcoma, malignant glomus tumours, skeletal muscles (pleomorphic and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), vascular (epithelioid hemangioendothelioma,  angiosarcoma),  sarcoma  of  uncertain  differentiation  as  well  as  synovial, epithelioid, alveolar soft part, clear cell, desmoplastic small round cell, extra-renal rhabdoid, malignant mesenchymoma,  PEComa,  intimal sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, and undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas not otherwise specified (NOS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Excluded  were  chondrosarcoma  and  ewing  tumours  /  primitive  neuroectodermal  tumour  (PNET). Histology subtypes also not considered eligible were adipocytic sarcoma (all subtypes), all rhabdomyosarcoma  that  were  not  alveolar  or  pleomorphic,  chondrosarcoma,  osteosarcoma,  Ewing tumours  /  PNET,  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST),  dermofibromatosis  sarcoma  protuberans, inflammatory  myofibroblastic  sarcoma,  malignant  mesothelioma,  mixed  mesodermal  tumours  of  the uterus.

In addition, all patients needed to have metastatic and not only locally advanced disease, World Health Organization  (WHO)  performance  status  0-1,  and  to  have  progressed  after  no  more  than  4  prior treatments (2 in case of combination treatments) for advanced disease.

All  patients  had  to  be  pre-treated  with  anthracycline  or  not  to  be  suitable  for  such  treatment.  QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) &lt;480 msec at baseline as well as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within  the  normal  range  &gt;50%)  was  requested,  as  well  as  adequate  bone  marrow,  lever  and  renal function.

## Treatments

Eligible patients were first stratified according to the following factors: a) WHO performance status: 0 vs. 1 and b) number of prior lines of systemic treatment for advanced disease: 0, 1 vs. 2+.  Patients were then centrally randomised in a 2:1 ratio of pazopanib: placebo to receive 800 mg pazopanib daily dosing  or  matching  placebo.  Patients  continued  on  study  drug  (pazopanib  or  placebo)  until  disease progression,  death,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  withdrawal  of  consent.  The  design  of  the  study  is presented in Figure 1.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare progression free survival (PFS) (by independent radiology review) in pazopanib-treated versus placebo-treated patients.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate and compare overall survival (OS) in the two treatment arms , to  evaluate  PFS  in  the  3  histology  subtypes  (leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  'other'  STS eligible histologies) recruited into the study, to compare the two treatment arms for overall response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate (ORR), to compare the two treatment arms for time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DR), and to assess safety and tolerability.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint

Progression-free survival, defined as the interval between the date of randomisation and the earliest date of either disease progression or death due to any cause.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Overall survival, defined as the time from date of randomisation until date of death due to any cause.

## Other secondary endpoints

PFS in the 3 histology types (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other eligible histologies).

ORR defined as the percentage of patients who achieved either confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

Time to response, defined for the subset of patients who achieved a confirmed CR or PR, defined as the time from date of randomisation until date of first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first).

Duration of response, defined for the subset of patients who achieved a confirmed CR or PR, defined as the time from date of first documented evidence of CR or PR until date of either the first documented sign  of  progressive  disease  (PD)  or  death  due  to  any  cause.  Patients  who  have  neither  died  nor progressed will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiologic assessment.

Safety and tolerability endpoints included evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and changes from baseline in vital signs (including WHO performance status (PS)), laboratory parameters and LVEF.

## Exploratory endpoints

Changes in quality of life (QoL) from baseline, as assessed by the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)C30 and EQ-5D.

## Sample size

The primary endpoint is PFS and the trial was powered to detect at least a 37% decrease in the hazard rate  (HR)  (HR  less  than  or  equal  to  0.63)  corresponding  to  an  increase  from  2.2  to  3.5  months  in median PFS. A total of 224 PFS events were required for detecting the targeted difference with 90% power and a 5% two-sided alpha level. For OS, the trial was powered to detect a 33% decrease in the death hazard rate (HR less than or equal to 0.67) corresponding to an increase from 8 to 12 months in median OS. The overall power on this endpoint was 80% based on 206 death events.

After observing a higher than expected recruitment rate, the expected sample size was increased to 360 patients in a period of 22 months. At the time of this decision, approximately 130 patients were recruited, and there was no access to unblinded data. The median assumptions for PFS and OS were not changed. However, the number of PFS events was increased from 224 events to 274 PFS events which  provided  at  least  95%  power  on  the  primary  endpoint  at  the  time  of  the  final  analysis. Increasing the number of required events (deaths) to 279 provides 90% power to detect a HR of less than or equal to 0.67 for the OS endpoint.

## Randomisation

Eligible patients were first stratified according to PS (0 vs. 1) and number of prior lines of systemic treatment for advanced disease: 0, 1 vs. 2+. Patients were then randomised in the placebo and treatment arms using a permuted blocks randomisation technique.

## Blinding

The study was double-blind.

## Statistical methods

Two analyses were planned in this study. The first planned analysis of the study was when the final event goal (274 events) for PFS endpoint had occurred, and mature OS data (70% of the required death events) was available for an interim OS analysis. The final analysis on OS occurred when at least the required number of death events (279) for the OS analysis accrued.

## Primary efficacy analysis of PFS

The primary PFS analysis occurred after 1) at least 274 PFS events (progression or death by any cause) documented, 2) at least 195 deaths documented, 3) all subjects have been followed for at least 3 months after randomisation

The  primary  analysis  evaluated  PFS  within  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomised subjects were analyzed in the arm they were allocated by randomisation). This analysis was performed using  the  data  from  the  independent  radiological  review  of  the  various  scans  from  the  disease assessments.

## Sensitivity analyses of PFS

Ten pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS as described in Table 7.

## Subgroup analyses of PFS

The following subgroups were explored in the analysis of PFS data by Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank analyses with adjustment for stratification  factors  of  baseline  WHO  PS  and  number  of  prior  lines  of systemic  therapy  for  advanced  disease:  Histology  types  (leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  or  'other'  STS histologies), baseline WHO PS: 0 vs. 1, number of prior lines of therapy for advanced disease (0, 1 vs. 2+), age: older or younger than 65 years, race (White vs. Asian/Other), gender, recruitment region: US, EU/Australia and Japan/Korea, standard of care in each region at the time of starting the study and tumour grade at initial diagnosis (post-hoc analysis).

## Post-hoc analyses

Post-hoc  analyses  of  PFS  were  conducted  by  the  same  method  as  many  of  the  other  sensitivity analysis, i.e.,  a  log  rank  analyses  with  adjustment  for  stratification  factors  of  baseline  WHO  PS  and number of prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 369 patients with STS were enrolled into the study. At the time of clinical cut-off, 1 patient in the placebo arm and 18 patients in the pazopanib arm remained on study treatment. Most patients (96%) who received placebo discontinued study treatment due to PD, as compared to 68% of patients who received pazopanib. The other most common reasons patients in the pazopanib arm discontinued treatment were toxicity related to study drug (14%) and subject refusal/patient decision (5%).

The participant flow is displayed in Table 8.

## Recruitment

A total of 369 subjects with STS were enrolled into the study at 72 centres in 13 countries between 06 October 2008 and 26 February 2010.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol was approved on 23 June 2008 and has been amended twice as follows:

Amendment  1  (19  June  2009):  Selection  criteria  were  modified  to:  allow  alveolar  or  pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, to exclude patients with nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal tumour spread,  with  known  intraluminal  metastatic  lesions  in  gastrointestinal  system  with  increased  risk  of bleeding,  with  history  of  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  surgery  within  the  last  6  months  and  with endobronchial  lesions  and/or  infiltrations  of  major  pulmonary  vessels.  In  addition  one  of  the  major changes was the increase in sample size from 255 to 360 patients. Finally, PFS analysis would not occur until 3 months from the last patient first visit and the required number of death events for the interim OS analysis (195 deaths) had occurred.

Amendment 2 (21 June 2010): The majority of patients in the study had received prior anthracyclinecontaining  chemotherapy  which  poses  a  significant  risk  for  cardiac  dysfunction.  Since  decreases  in LVEF were reported in some patients participating in the study, additional data were to be obtained on cardiac risk factors and prior treatments. Additional guidance on the management of LVEF changes and cardiac dysfunction was provided. A description of additional data that were to be collected for cardiac events and clarification on the timing of LVEF, thyroid stimulating hormone, and free T4 evaluations was provided.

b. Alive and continuing in follow-up

c. CIs for quartiles were estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method.

d. Hazard ratios were estimated using the Pike estimator. A hazard ratio &lt;1 indicates a lower risk compared with placebo. The hazard ratio and p-value from the stratified log-rank test are adjusted for WHO PS and number of prior lines of systemic treatment for advanced disease. P-value ≤ 0.04434 was statistically significant after adjusting for previously conducted interim analysis.

b Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of Complete Response or Partial Response until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

## Exploratory endpoints

## EORTC QLQ-30

Completion  rates  for  the  QLQ-C30  for  each  treatment  group  were  78%  or  greater  for  subjects remaining in the study, with a higher rate of dropout on the placebo arm. This resulted in relatively fewer  QoL  assessments  available  at  Weeks  8  and  12,  for  the  placebo  arm  (47  and  28%)  than  the pazopanib arm (63 and 55%). The Mixed-Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analyses of change from baseline  in  Global  Health  Status/QoL  showed  a  numerically  greater  decline  for  pazopanib,  but  no statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  in  this  analysis  between  pazopanib  and  placebo, across each of the 3 assessment time points.

There were noticeable differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  mean  change  from  baseline  for several symptom scales across assessment time points, in particular these symptoms include: fatigue, nausea  and  vomiting,  appetite  loss,  and  diarrhea  with  subjects;  the  results  suggest  that  these symptoms were worse on pazopanib (data not shown)

## EQ-5D

Completion  rates  for  the  EQ-5D  for  each  treatment  group  across  each  assessment  time  point  were greater than 82% at both screening and Week 4. The pazopanib and placebo groups were balanced at baseline for EQ-5D domain scores, Utility (Index) and Thermometer (VAS). Although results from an analysis  of  change  from  baseline  adjusted  for  baseline  score  for  EQ-5D  VAS  numerically  favoured placebo, the results from these analyses did not show any statistically significant differences between treatment groups (data not shown).

## Ancillary analyses

The MAH submitted a large number of ancillary analyses. The results of the PFS and OS in subgroups with  different  STS  histology  and  the  results  of  the  pre-planned  sensitivity  analysis  are  presented  in Tables 17, 18 and 19 respectively.

b. Hazard ratios are estimated using the Pike estimator. A hazard ratio &lt;1 indicates a lower risk with pazopanib compared with placebo. The hazard ratio is adjusted for WHO PS and number of prior lines of systemic treatment. Note: These analyses mirror the primary analysis except that they are based on the individual Intent-to-treat population of leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and 'other' STS.

The MAH has performed a 'worst case time-to-treatment-failure analysis' where an event was defined as the earliest of progression or death in the placebo arm and as the earliest of progression, death, withdraw from study drug or withdraw from study (regardless of reason) in the pazopanib arm. Also the MAH conducted the analysis on the 3 major histology groups (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and the group designated as 'other') according to the requested specifications on 'worst case' analysis. Both analyses confirmed a PFS improvement for the pazopanib treated patients (data not shown).

## Supportive study

## VEG20002

This was a Phase II, multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised study designed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of pazopanib in patients with relapsed or refractory STS, for whom no standard therapy existed.  Patients received oral pazopanib, 800 mg once daily, until disease progression, unacceptable drug-related events, intercurrent illnesses preventing further drug administration, or patient refusal. The study included a screening/baseline period, an open-label treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up visit. The study enrolled patients into 4 different strata based on the WHO classification of STS: leiomyosarcoma (uterine, skin or non organ origin), adipocytic tumours, synovial sarcoma, and other types of high or intermediate grade malignant STS.

The key eligibility criteria were: patients with high or intermediate grade of STS that was relapsed or refractory and incurable by surgery or radiotherapy, tumour progression per RECIST v1.0 compared with a prior disease assessment during the past 6 months, ineligible for chemotherapy or not more than 1 combination therapy or 2 single chemotherapy agents for advanced disease, WHO PS of 0 or 1, and protocol-specified criteria for adequate organ function.

The primary endpoint was progression-free (PF) rate at Week 12, defined as a binary endpoint with 'success' equal to the number of patients with CR, PR or stable disease (SD)/ total number of patients based  on  the  disease  evaluation  performed  12  weeks  after  the  start  of  treatment.  The  secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, ORR, Time to response, and Duration of response.

Thirty-seven patients could be recruited into each stratum in two stages: 17 patients in the first stage and 20 patients in the second stage. After treating and following 17 patients for 12 weeks, sufficient responses  were  seen  in  leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  other  types  of  STS  ('other'  STS); therefore patients with these types of sarcoma were enrolled into the second stage of these strata.

A total of 142 patients with STS were enrolled into the study. The 142 patients consisted of 41 patients with leiomyosarcoma, 19 patients with adipocytic sarcoma, 37 patients with synovial sarcoma, and 41 patients with \"other\" STS.

## 2.5.2 Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The  efficacy  results  are  derived  from  the  pivotal  study  VEG110727  (n=369)  and  the  supportive VEG20002  study  (n=142).  The  pivotal  study  was  well  conducted,  with  no  problematic  protocol amendments and relatively few protocol violations.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the ITT population, a statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in the pazopanib arm compared with the placebo arm. The median PFS in the placebo arm was 7.0 weeks (95% CI: 4.4, 8.1) in the placebo arm and 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 17.9, 21.3) in the pazopanib arm, with a corresponding HR of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.48; p&lt;0.001) as assessed by IRC. The 13 weeks improvement in median PFS  in  the  pazopanib  arm  as  compared  to  placebo  in  the  heavily  pre-treated  VEG110727  study population is statistically significant and exceeded the targeted improvement by over two-fold. Results of  pre-specified  and  post-hoc analyses provide assurance as to the accuracy of PFS determinations. Factors  which  may  have  confounded  PFS  in  favour  of  pazopanib  including  the  schedule  of  disease assessment and off-schedule assessments were systematically evaluated and found to have little effect on the observed PFS HR. In all subgroup and sensitivity analyses, a very robust and consistent PFS benefit  was  found  in  favour  of  pazopanib.    In  addition,  a  'worst  case  time-to-treatment-failure analysis' confirmed a PFS improvement for pazopanib treated patients.

Although few objective responses by RECIST were observed with pazopanib in VEG110727 (no CRs and only very few PRs were seen), treatment with pazopanib almost doubled the occurrence of disease stabilisation (SD) which is also considered clinically relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  final  OS  analysis  from  trial  VEG110727  (N=369)  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference between  pazopanib  and  placebo.  The  HR  only  numerically  favoured  pazopanib  (HR  0.87;  95%  CI: 0.67,  1.12),  and  the  p-value  was  not  statistically  significant  (0.256).  The  trial  was  not  adequately powered to show differences in OS of less than four months.

The synovial sarcoma histology subgroup only included 38 patients. This is why the efficacy results in this subgroup should be interpreted with caution taken into account the wide confidence intervals as well. It is acknowledged that the paradoxical adverse effect observed on the final median OS in the pazopanib  arm  as  compared  to  the  placebo  arm  could  have  arisen  by  chance,  possibly  due  to  the unusually  long  survival  of  patients  on  placebo  in  this  small  subgroup.  For  the  above  reasons,  the results of the subgroup analyses for OS have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC and this issue has  been  addressed  in  the  RMP.  Finally,  due  to  the  small  numbers,  the  studied  biomarkers  and prognostic factors are unlikely to present an explanation for the observed phenomenon.

The possible rebound phenomenon -after stopping pazopanib- that might have influenced post-study survival  -  was  investigated  by  the  MAH.  A  rebound  effect  could  explain  the  lack  of  OS  benefit  as observed  also  in  the  VEG110727  study.  The  Kaplan  Meier  estimate  for  survival  post  progression showed that (median) survival seemed reduced in the pazopanib arm.

No  statistically  significant  difference  in  QoL  was  overall  observed  between  treatment  arms,  but  for certain specific symptoms (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhoea) the placebo arm was favoured in absolute numbers. No QoL data was collected after progression or study week 12. There was  no  indication  that  pazopanib  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  PS  of  patients  in  an  exploratory analysis.

Supportive study VEG20002 met its primary endpoint of a 12 week progression-free rate ≥ 40% in patients  with  leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  'other'  STS  treated  with  pazopanib,  thus suggesting  activity  of  the  drug  in  these  histological  subgroups  of  STS.  In  contrast,  the  response observed  in  the  adipocytic  subgroup  (2/17  patients  with  SD)  did  not  meet  the  response  criteria  in order to warrant further enrolment. As a consequence, patients with liposarcoma have been excluded from  the  confirmatory  VEG110727  study.  In  conclusion,  no  benefit  of  pazopanib  in  the  adipocytic subgroup has been proven.

Based on the above and the inclusion criteria  of both  pivotal  and  supportive  studies,  the  indication does not include patients with adipocytic sarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma,  GISTs,  dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans,  Ewing  sarcoma/primitive  neuroectodermal tumours, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and malignant mesothelioma.

All 27 patients who were unsuited for prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease had received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and progressed within 12 months. It is reasonable to include those patients in the trial and have them encompassed by the indication. Neither the pivotal trial nor the supportive data support the inclusion of patients too frail for mono-drug chemotherapy. Therefore the indication has been amended accordingly to include that '' patients who received only neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy should have progressed within 12 months''.

Very few samples have actually been available for biomarker investigations which is insufficient. The potential role of specific biomarkers for patient selection and/or monitoring of treatment is unknown. At  present  the  MAH  has  no  plans  for  further  investigations  on  biomarkers  as  no  studies  in  STS  are ongoing. Future studies are still under consideration.  In case the MAH engages in further studies in patients  with  STS,  the  CHMP  recommended  that  the  MAH  includes  pre-specified  investigations  on biomarkers and measures on quality of life/symptom control as exploratory endpoints.

## 2.5.3 Conclusions on clinical efficacy

The  CHMP  considered  that  both  studies  VEG110727  and  VEG20002  provide  robust  evidence  for clinically significant effects of second-line pazopanib treatment in patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy.

## 2.6 Clinical safety

The  safety population comprised  all randomised  subjects  who  receive at least one  dose  of investigational  product  (either  pazopanib  or  placebo),  and  will  be  based  on  the  actual  treatment received if this differs from that to which the subject was randomised.

The  safety  database  of  pazopanib  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  includes  data  collected  on  382  of which 240 patients enrolled in the pivotal VEG110727 phase III study, and 142 patients enrolled in the VEG20002 supportive phase II study.

The date of data cut-off  was  22  November  2010  for  the  pivotal  study  and  20  August  2010  for  the supportive study.

## Patient exposure

In  the  pivotal  VEG110727  trial  240  patients  were  treated  with  pazopanib  (246  were  randomised  to pazopanib  but  6  patients  were  excluded  from  the  safety  population  as  they  did  not  receive  the allocated  treatment  with  pazopanib).  The  recommended  dosage  was  800  mg  once  daily.  Patients stayed longer on treatment in the pazopanib arm (median: 19.36 weeks) compared to the placebo arm (8.14 weeks). The summary of exposure for the pivotal study is displayed in Table 21.

In the uncontrolled, supportive VEG20002 trial 142 patients were treated with pazopanib at the same target  dose.  In  the  integrated  analysis  of  the  two  studies  in  STS  patients,  the  median  time  on pazopanib treatment was 3.6 months.

## Adverse events

## Common AEs

In  the  pivotal  trial  enrolling  patients  with  STS,  99%  of  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  89%  of patients in the placebo arm reported AEs. The most common AEs in pazopanib-treated patients were fatigue  (65%),  diarrhoea  (59%),  nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension  (42%),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased appetite (40%) and hair colour changes (39%). In the placebo arm the most common AES were  fatigue  (48%),  nausea  (22%),  tumour  pain  (21%),  musculoskeletal  pain  (20%),  decreased appetite (19%), dyspnoea (17%), constipation (17%) and diarrhoea (15%). In comparison, directly tumour-related symptoms and some constitutive symptoms occurred with a similar frequency in the pazopanib  arm  compared  to  the  control  arm  (tumour  pain:  29%,  musculoskeletal  pain: 23%, dyspnoea: 20%, constipation: 14%, pyrexia: 10%).

The same pattern was observed in the pooled analysis across STS studies (including the pivotal study + the supportive VEG20002 trial).

## Severity of AEs

In pazopanib-treated patients 49% of patients reported an AE of grade 3 and 10% an AE of grade 4 severity. The most common grade 3 events were fatigue (13%), tumour pain (8%), hypertension (7%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnoea (5%) and diarrhoea (5%). Severe events were also reported in the placebo arm ; 19% of placebo-treated patients reported a grade 3 event and 6% a grade 4 event. The  most  common  grade  3  events  in  placebo-treated  patients  include  tumour  pain,  dyspnoea  and fatigue.

f Laboratory abnormalities were reported as adverse events less frequently by investigators than these abnormalities occurred as indicated by laboratory value tables.  Certain laboratory abnormalities occurring in

≥ 15 % of patients who received pazopanib and more frequently than with placebo in the randomised controlled trial for the treatment of STS (VEG110727; N=240) include Leukopenia (All Grades-44 %; Grade 3-1 %, Grade 4-

0 %), Neutropenia (All Grades-33 %; Grade 3-4 %, Grade 4-0 %), Thrombocytopenia (All Grades-36 %; Grade 3-

3 %, Grade 4-&lt; 1 %), ALT increased (All Grades-46 %; Grade 3-8 %, Grade 4-2 %), AST increased (All Grades-

51 %; Grade 3-5 %, Grade 4-3 %), Albumin increased (All Grades-34 %; Grade 3-&lt; 1 %, Grade 4-0 %), and Bilirubin increased(All Grades-29 %; Grade 3-1 %, Grade 4-0 %).

## Adverse events of special interest

These  include:  Liver  chemistry  abnormalities  and  AEs,  hypertension,  cardiac  and  vascular  events, pneumothorax, thyroid function abnormalities, bowel perforations and enteral fistulae and proteinuria.

## Liver chemistry abnormalities and AEs

In study VEG110727 bilirubin (BIL) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations were reported in 5% and 18 % of pazopanib treated patients (compared with 2% and 5% patients treated with placebo), with ALT elevations &gt;8x ULN in 13 (5%) pazopanib treated patients (versus 2 (2%) placebo treated patients).  Six  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  experienced  ALT  elevations  &gt;20xULN:  3  patients  had Grade 4 ALT elevations in association with fatal SAEs; all other 3 remaining patients recovered. The majority  of  ALT&gt;3  ULN  elevations  (92.9%)  are  detected  in  the  first  18  weeks  of  treatment  with pazopanib.

Incidence and time to development of liver chemistry abnormalities is consistent with previous data in RCC.

'Possible Hy's Law Criteria' (defined as &gt;3xULN ALT &amp; &gt;2x ULN BIL &amp; &lt;3xULN alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (or ALP missing)) were met by 4 patients in study VEG110727 and 1 patient in the VEG20002 study.  In  all  these  patients,  there  were  confounding  medical  conditions  at  study  entry:  pre-existing biliary disease or elevated bilirubin, pre-existing drug-related liver disease or primary disease in the liver. For three of these patients, measurement of direct bilirubin was performed at the same time as the  total  bilirubin  was  measured.  Two  patients  had  hyperbilirubinemia  predominantly  unconjugated. Samples  for  UGT1A1  analysis  were  available  for  2  of  the  3  patients:  one  patient  had  the  UGT1A1 TA6TA7  genotype  and  one  patient  had  the  UGT1A1  TA7TA7  genotype  which  may  explain  the hyperbilirubinemia. The liver chemistries recovered in 3 of the 5 patients, whereas recovery was not demonstrated in the other 2 patients. Another patient met Hy's law criteria; however, the laboratory values were only reported in the SAE form and not in the case report form.  Symptoms consistent with liver failure were observed in two patients in study VEG110727 but also confounding clinical events; in one patient a potential contribution of pazopanib could not be excluded despite the confounding effects of concomitant moxifloxacin and extensive malignant disease. In the other patient disease progression, Grade 5 pulmonary embolus, and ischemic hepatitis were the causes of death. In VEG110727 study, another patient had ischemic hepatitis as a result of progressive disease with cardiac tamponade and extensive thrombosis, but no liver failure (no bilirubin elevation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across the STS integrated data (N=382), 54 (14%) patients had an elevation in ALT &gt;3 x ULN. In an analysis performed overall liver enzymes elevations were reversible in 46/54 (85%) patients and ALT values  recovered  to  Grade ≤ 1  (&lt;2.5xULN).  Based  on  previous  data  in  RCC  the  recovery  was documented in 91% of patients. The median time to recovery post study treatment interruption was 22 days (range 5-39 days). Among the remaining 8 patients (15%) who did not recover, 3 had no follow-up data and their liver events occurred after discontinuing study for either progressive disease or unrelated toxicity. Of the remaining 5 who did not recover, 4 patients with fatal AEs had ongoing liver dysfunction confounded by medical conditions and one patient was still on treatment at data cutoff.

Adaptation  (defined  as  return  to  Grade  0  or  baseline  levels  of  ALT  from  &gt;3xULN  while  exposed  to study drug without any interruption) was experienced by 10 patients which remained on study drug despite elevations of ALT &gt;3xULN (and &lt;8xULN) and experienced adaptation while remaining on the same dose of pazopanib. The majority of these patients had a peak ALT ≤ 5xULN (8 of 10 patients). The median time to adaptation was 46 days (range of 8 to 168 days).

Re-challenge (restart of pazopanib at the same or reduced dose after interruption due to ALT ≥ 3xULN and subsequent recovery to Grade ≤ 1) was performed in 16 patients. Of these, 63% tolerated a rechallenge without recurrent ALT elevation and 38% had recurrent ALT elevations. None of the patients with a positive re-challenge had an adverse clinical outcome. The data reported in STS are consistent with prior experience in RCC where 31 patients were re-challenged, 65% tolerated a re-challenge and 32% had recurrent elevations, none with adverse clinical outcome.

## Hypertension

In  study  VEG110727  on-therapy  AEs  of  hypertension  were  reported  in  101  (42%)  patients  in  the pazopanib arm and 7 (6%) patients in the placebo arm, with Grade 3 hypertension observed in 7% (16 patients) and 0%, respectively. There were no reports of Grade 4 or Grade 5 hypertension. No SAEs of hypertension  were  reported  in  the  study.  However,  in  the  pazopanib  arm  hypertension  led  to  dose reductions in 7% of patients, drug interruptions in 10% of patients and permanent discontinuation in 3% of  patients.  No  incidence  of  hypertensive  crisis  AE  occurred  across  STS  studies.  Systolic  blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg was observed in 96 (40%) patients in the pazopanib arm (29 [12%] ≥ 170 mmHg) and 13 (11%) patients in the placebo arm. Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg was observed in 134 (56%) patients in the pazopanib arm (15 [6%] ≥ 110  mmHg) and 22 (18%) patients in the placebo arm.

These data are in line with prior experience with pazopanib in advanced RCC where 47% of patients experience hypertension of worsening of hypertension during treatment with pazopanib. Hypertension occurred  early  in  the  course  of  treatment  for  both  RCC  (88%  within  the  first  18  weeks)  and  STS patients (40.1% by Day 9 and 90.1% within the first 18 weeks).

## Cardiac and Vascular Events

## a) Myocardial Dysfunction

Due to the potential prior exposure of STS patients to cardiotoxic therapy (i.e., anthracycline), LVEF monitoring was conducted at baseline in VEG20002 and at baseline and Week 12 in VEG110727 study (with  later  amendment  for  monitoring  beyond  Week  12),  or  as  clinically  indicated.  Myocardial dysfunction was defined by development of symptoms of myocardial dysfunction or, ≥ 15% absolute decline  compared  to  baseline  or, ≥ 10% compared to baseline that  is  also  below  the  lower  limit  of normal (LLN).

In  study  VEG110727,  the  rate  of  AEs  of  myocardial  dysfunction  of  any  grade  was  higher  in  the pazopanib  arm  (9%)  compared  with  placebo  (5%)  before  adjusting  for  exposure.  The  exposure-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adjusted incidence rates (using a 100 patient-years rate) for myocardial dysfunction AEs of any grade were similar across the two arms of study VEG110727.

The majority of myocardial dysfunction events were mild or moderate in severity and were reported as left  ventricular  dysfunction  based  on  decline  in  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  assessments.  In VEG110727 study 4 patients in the pazopanib arm (2%) had Grade ≥ 3 events; no fatal events were reported. All events in the placebo arm were of lower grade of severity.

Symptomatic left ventricular decline (congestive heart failure) was reported in 2 out of 382 patients (0.5 %) while asymptomatic decline was reported in the others. No fatal events were reported.

In VEG110727 study, an analysis of LVEF decline from baseline was conducted in patients with at least one post-baseline LVEF measurement. Data was available for 58% of patients in pazopanib arm and for  32%  of  patients  treated  with  placebo.  Among  patients  with  on-therapy  LVEF  assessments, decreased  LVEF  was  seen  in  15/140  (11%)  pazopanib-treated  patients  versus  1/39  (3%)  placebotreated  patient.  The  15  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  who  developed  left  ventricular  systolic dysfunction (LSVD) all had a normal LVEF at baseline and they had all previously been exposed to an anthracycline.  Only  3  cases  were  symptomatic  and  the  recommended  dose  adjustment  was  not performed  for  2  of  these  cases.  Eight  of  the  15  patients  either  continued  on  study  drug  without interruption or resumed study drug following interruption. Six of the 8 patients who continued study drug did so at a reduced dose of 600 mg (one of these had a second dose reduction to 400 mg). One patient, who resumed drug following an interruption, experienced recurrence of LVEF decline following resumption  of  pazopanib;  each  episode  of  LVEF  decline  preceded  by  hypertension.  Four  of  the  15 subjects had full recovery (within 5 % of baseline) and 5 had partial recovery (within the normal range, but &gt; 5 % below baseline).  Five patients had insufficient follow-up data; whereas one patient did not recover;  this  patient  had  several  cardiac  risk  factors,  and  died  in  hospice  with  terminal  care. Hypertension and/or requirement of new anti-hypertensive medication and/or dose modifications were observed in 13 of the 15 patients treated with pazopanib with LVEF decline.

In study VEG20002, where LVEF by imaging assessment was only performed at baseline, there were no reports of AE of myocardial dysfunction.

## b) Arrhythmia

In study VEG110727 the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was 6% in the pazopanib arm and 9% in the placebo arm. Of these, 5 (2%) of pazopanib treated patients experienced QT prolongation of any grade, with 2 patients with grade ≥ 3 events (QTc&gt; 500 msec) without associated arrhythmias. There were no reports of QT prolongation in the placebo group.

The  percentage  of  STS  patients  developing  cardiac  arrhythmia  AEs  from  the  integrated  pazopanib dataset  was  6%  which  is  identical  to  the  incidence  observed  in  the  pivotal  study  performed  with pazopanib in RCC. The incidence of AE of QT prolongation was 1% in the STS population, and Grade 3 QT prolongation occurred in both the STS and RCC populations at &lt;1%. There were no reports of AE of torsades de pointes (TdP), or sudden death in the STS patients. However, in study VEG110727 one fatal event in the pazopanib arm could have been associated with arrhythmia as he died at home and cause was unknown, although the investigator considered the event as related to disease progression.

The exposure adjusted rate per/100 patient years (PY) for arrhythmia was 11.57 for pazopanib-treated patients in pivotal STS study and 6.85 in the pazopanib arm of the pivotal RCC study. In the placebo arm of STS study the rate was 29.21 compared with 6.39 in the placebo arm of RCC study.

## c) Venous Embolic and Thrombotic Events (VTE)

In study VEG110727, 13 patients (5%) in the pazopanib arm and 3 patients (2%) in the placebo arm experienced on-therapy or post therapy VTEs. More specifically, 10 of these 13 patients on pazopanib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (including inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis and vascular graft thrombosis) without reports of associated pulmonary embolism (PE). Three patients treated with pazopanib  experienced  PEs,  with  a  fatal  outcome  in  two  of  them,  which  have  not  been  considered related to study treatment but to disease progression. The PE event experienced by the third patient was an incidental asymptomatic finding at a tumour assessment showing progressive disease. In the placebo arm, 2 of the 3 patients developed DVTs (including renal vein thrombosis) without reports of associated PE, and 1 patient experienced a PE.

In study VEG20002, 8 (6%) patients reported on-therapy VTEs. All events were non-fatal; 5 events of PE, 1 IVC thrombosis and 3 DVTs were reported. One patient had 2 events of IVC thrombosis and a PE. Of the 5 events of PE, two of these were diagnosed in association with progressive disease; three of the events were asymptomatic events diagnosed either at scheduled tumour assessments or by chest CT scan upon diagnosis of a DVT.

The exposure adjusted rate of VTEs in VEG110727 study was 10.03 events per 100 PY for patients treated with pazopanib and 7.97 events per 100 PY for patients treated with placebo. The exposure adjusted  rate  of  VTE  was  9.84  events  per  100  PY  for  the  integrated  STS  population.  The  exposure adjusted rate of PE was similar in the placebo and pazopanib arm of study VEG110727. The exposure adjusted rates in both placebo and pazopanib treated patients in the STS integrated dataset are higher than those seen in the RCC population. The incidence of VTEs in pazopanib-treated patients was higher in the STS population (5%) than in the RCC population (2%).

## d) Arterial Embolic and Thrombotic Events

In  study  VEG110727,  5  (2%)  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm,  and  no  patients  in  the  placebo  arm, experienced  arterial  embolic  and  thrombotic  events:  4  patients  experienced  Grade  1  to  Grade  3 myocardial ischemic events, and 1 patient experienced a Grade 4 cerebrovascular accident 85 days following the last dose of pazopanib that resolved 4 days later.

In study VEG20002, there were 2 on-therapy arterial thromboembolic events: 1 patient had Grade 3 coronary artery disease, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 thrombosis of a mechanical aortic valve.

The exposure adjusted rates for arterial thrombo-embolic events for the STS integrated dataset was 3.28/100 PY versus 3.85/100 PY to the RCC dataset.

Arterial thrombo-embolic events were more frequently reported with pazopanib than with placebo in both STS and RCC studies.

## d) Haemorrhagic events

In study VEG110727 the incidence of haemorrhagic events (all grades) was 22%  in the pazopanib arm and 8% in the placebo arm; the incidence rates of Grade 3 or Grade 4 haemorrhagic events were 1% or &lt;1% and similar between the treatment arms. No patients reported Grade 5 events. Epistaxis (2%), mouth (3%) and anal (2%) haemorrhage were the most common categories of haemorrhage observed with  pazopanib.  Two  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  experienced  Grade  4  haemorrhagic  events:  1 patient had abdominal bleeding (assessed as potentially related to study drug as well as to abdominal metastasis)  4  days  after  stop  of  study  drug,  whereas  the  second  patient  experienced  intracranial haemorrhage during treatment with pazopanib in presence of cerebral metastasis.

In the integrated STS database haemorrhagic events (all grades) were reported by 75 (20%) patients, of which 4 (1%) patients had Grade 3, and 3 (&lt;1%) Grade 4 events. No fatal events based on the prespecified MedDRA term list were reported.

Based on the RCC database, 16% of patients reported haemorrhagic events all grades, and 2% Grades 3 to 5 events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pneumothorax

In VEG110727 study 8 (3%) of pazopanib-treated patients versus none in the placebo arm reported on-therapy AEs of pneumothorax.

Overall,  in  both  STS  studies,  15  (4%)  of  the  382  pazopanib-treated  STS  patients  experienced pneumothorax:  10  patients  were  Grade  1  or  2  events,  whereas  5  patients  reported  Grade  3  or  4 events. At the time of clinical cut-off, 9/15 (60%) patients had recovered from the pneumothorax AE, additional 2 recovered with sequelae, and 4 patients had the event reported as ongoing. Of the 5 cases of Grade 3 or Grade 4 pneumothorax, recovery with sequelae was documented in 3 patients and full recovery in 2 patients. The median time to first pneumothorax event was 40 days.

In the pivotal RCC study 1 of 290 (&lt;1%) patients treated with pazopanib developed a pneumothorax.

## Thyroid Function Abnormalities

In study VEG110727, the incidence of thyroid function abnormalities (and/or aggravation of previously altered thyroid function tests) was 34% in the pazopanib arm and 2% in the placebo arm. Across the STS studies, 15 pazopanib-treated patients experienced concomitant elevations in TSH and decreases in  T4  (5  &lt;TSH ≤ 10  MU/L  or  &gt;10  MU/L  and  T4  &lt;LLN)  that  were  consistent  with  hypothyroidism. Laboratory evidence of hyperthyroidism (TSH &lt;0.3 MU/L and T4 &gt;ULN) was confirmed in 5 patients in the pazopanib arm, all from study VEG110727. Twenty (5%) patients in the STS studies reported ontherapy AEs of hypothyroidism. Based on RCC studies a rate of 4% reported in the current prescribing information  for  pazopanib.  Two  STS  patients  (&lt;1%)  reported  AEs  of  hyperthyroidism.  All  thyroidrelated AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and no SAEs were reported.

## Bowel Perforations and Enteral Fistulae

Across  VEG110727  and  VEG20002  studies,  4/382  (1%)  patients  experienced  bowel  perforations  or fistulae.  All  these  patients  were  known  to  have  abdominal  metastases  at  study  entry;  for  the  2 patients with perforations, these developed at the site of metastatic lesions. One of the two patients died due to associated fatal peritonitis. Of the 2 patients with fistulas, one had a fistula at baseline and then developed another during study; events in both patients resolved. In the integrated RCC study data,  gastrointestinal  perforation  or  fistula  has  been  reported  in  5/586  patients  (0.9%),  and  fatal perforation events have occurred in 2/586 (0.3%).

## Proteinuria

In  the  STS  studies,  proteinuria  was  reported  as  an  AE  for  2  patients  (&lt;1%),  one  Grade  1  and  one Grade 2. An additional patient enrolled in study VEG110727 reported Grade 4 nephrotic syndrome with a concurrent SAE of increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPC) and was permanently discontinued from study treatment as a result.

In addition to AE incidence, regular urinalysis was performed in both STS studies, but an integrated analysis of urine protein/creatinine ratio data was not performed because this data was not available for VEG20002 trial. In study VEG110727, the protocol pre-specified that a ratio ≥ 3 prompted a 24hour urine protein collection and, if the urine protein was ≥ 3 g, treatment was interrupted until UPC returned to &lt;3 and then restarted at a lower dose. In study VEG20002 patients with a 24 hr urine protein ≥ 2 g/24 hr had study drug interrupted and eventually resumed when reduced to &lt;2 g/24 hr.

In study VEG110727 3 patients (1%) in the pazopanib arm and 3 patients (3%) in the placebo arm experienced  a  UPC  ratio ≥ 3.  These  3    pazopanib-treated  patients  had  also  proteinuria ≥ 3  gr  at  24 hours urine analysis. All 3 patients had dose interruptions per the protocol followed by re-challenge at a lower dose. All three had repeat UPC ≥ 3 following re-challenge and were permanently discontinued from study.

In study VEG20002, 7 patients had Grade 2 proteinuria (1 - 2 gm/24 hr) and 1 patient had Grade 3 proteinuria  (5.05  gm/24  hr).  For  this  last  patient  no  subsequent  urine  protein  determinations  were available, as the patient discontinued study on the same day due to disease progression.

In  studies  conducted  with  advanced  RCC,  proteinuria  AEs  were  reported  in  44/586  (8%)  patients (Grade 3, 5/586 [&lt;1%] and Grade 4, 1/586 [&lt;1%]).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

As of the clinical cut-off date (24 October 2011) 95 patients had died in the placebo arm (77%) vs. 181 patients in the pazopanib arm (75%). The most common cause of death was progressive disease (165/181 deaths (91%) in the pazopanib arm vs. 86/95 (90%) in the placebo arm).

The summary of deaths for the pivotal study is presented in Table 23.

## Serious Adverse events

In the pivotal study seven Grade 5 (fatal) events were reported in 6 placebo-treated patients (5%) and nine  fatal  events  were  reported  in  8  pazopanib-treated  patients  (3%)  (Table  24).  In  the  pazopanib arm, only one event (multi-organ failure) was reported as treatment-related. However, the primary cause of death is not clear in all the cases. In comparison, the incidence of fatal SAEs was 4% in the pazopanib arm vs. 3% in the placebo arm in the pivotal study in the RCC indication. In the supportive study VEG20002, 10 patients had reports of fatal AEs. Three of these events were considered possibly treatment-related  (disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC),  depression,  peritonitis/peritoneal infection/small intestine perforation).

The incidence of patients reporting SAEs was 41% in the pazopanib arm compared to 24% the placebo arm in the pivotal study. Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 24% of pazopanib-treated patients and  in  5%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  The  most  common  SAEs  associated  with  pazopanib  were increased liver transaminases, pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue and left ventricular dysfunction.

In  comparison,  the  observed  incidence  of  SAEs  was  24%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  in  the  pivotal  RCC study. The summary of SAEs occurred in at least 2 patients in either treatment group in the pivotal study are displayed in Table 25.

## Laboratory findings

Haematology: Shifts in haematology parameters were consistent with observations in RCC patients. A higher  incidence  of  neutropenia,  leucopenia,  and  thrombocytopenia  occurred  in  pazopanib-treated patients  but  most  cases  were  mild/moderate  in  severity.  Grade  4  anaemia  occurred  in  2%  of pazopanib-treated patients.

Clinical  Chemistry: The  most  important  findings  are  liver  enzyme  elevations,  thyroid  function abnormalities and proteinuria that are mentioned under events of special interest. Most other shifts in chemistry parameters were mild in severity.

ECGs: Patients enrolled in the pivotal STS study had no clinically significant ECG findings at baseline. Post-baseline recordings revealed clinically significant ECG changes in 3% of patients (6 patients) in the pazopanib arm vs. 2% of patients in the placebo arm. Two pazopanib-treated patients had grade 3 QTc prolongations without associated ventricular arrhythmias. Two patients had tachycardia. The last 2 patients presented with cardiac ischemia and T wave/QRS abnormalities.

## Safety in special populations

## WHO PS status

During  the  on-therapy  portion  of  the  study,  54%  of  patients  treated  with  pazopanib  vs.  35%  of patients  on  placebo  reported  deterioration  in  performance  status,  which  is  worse  than  what  was observed  in  the  RCC  population  (46%  of  pazopanib-treated  patients  vs.  35%  of  placebo-treated patients). As expected, a poorer PS was also associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3/4/5 events (65% in patients with PS 1 or 2 compared to 51% in patients with PS 0).

Further to the CHMP request, two analyses (ITT population) to assess the dynamics of WHO performance status (PS) have been conducted by using the following 2 definitions in a 'time to deterioration' analysis : a) If the subject shows a 1 point increase in their WHO PS score from baseline which is then confirmed by remaining higher at the next visit or if a subject dies before this occurs, the subject is considered as experiencing an event at either the time of the 1 point increase or the date of death (the first occurring event) and b) If a subject shows a 2 point increase in their WHO PS score from baseline or if a subject dies before this occurs, the subject is considered as experiencing an event at either the time of the 2 point increase or the date of death (the first occurring event). For both analyses, if the subject didn't experience either, the subject is censored in the analysis at the time of the last WHO performance status score.

## Age

The overall incidence of AEs was similar between patients aged &lt; 65 years (n=289) and  65 years (n=93) across STS studies. Similarly, the overall incidence of severe events was comparable between these subsets (58% in younger patients vs. 57% in the elderly). There were 1% of fatal events in the elderly vs. 4% in the younger so there is no indication that elderly patients were more susceptible to severe  toxicities.  On  the  individual  AE  level,  AEs  like  fatigue,  hypertension,  decreased  appetite  and liver enzyme elevations occurred more frequently in the elderly whereas the younger reported a higher incidence of diarrhoea, vomiting, infections and tumour pain. Overall, 38% of the younger age group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported SAEs compared to 33% in the elderly. There was no specific accumulation of specific events in one or the other of the age groups.

## Gender

Overall, no marked differences in AEs were noted between male and female patients.

## Race

In the pivotal study pazopanib-associated AEs involving the skin and hair colour changes were more common in Asians than in White patients. On the other hand AEs of high grades of toxicity occurred at a slightly higher frequency in White patients.

## Immunological events

N/A

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No new information relevant to the proposed indication is available.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pivotal study 20% of pazopanib-treated patients permanently discontinued therapy due to AEs compared  to  5%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  most  common  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  in  the pazopanib arm were ALT increased, dyspnoea, left ventricular dysfunction, fatigue, hypertension and vomiting. In pazopanib arm, 32% of patients had AEs that lead to dose reductions compared to &lt; 1% in  the  placebo  arm.  Similarly,  50%  of  patients  treated  with  pazopanib  had  AEs  leading  to  dose interruptions compared to 10% in the control arm. The AEs most frequently leading to dose reductions and dose interruptions were fatigue, hypertension, nausea and diarrhoea.

## 2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of pazopanib has already been well characterized in patients with RCC and many of the former safety findings have been confirmed in patients with STS but important differences have also  been  noted,  including  development  of  pneumothorax  and  myocardial  dysfunction.  Although  the overall tolerability of the treatment expressed in terms of mean daily dose (approximately 700 mg) was acceptable and similar between RCC and STS studies, the mean treatment duration (exposure) was  markedly  lower  in  STS  patients  (4.5  months)  compared  to  RCC  patients  (7.4  months).  In  the pivotal STS trial almost all patients in the pazopanib arm reported AEs (99%). A very high number of patients in the placebo arm also reported AEs (89%). This is indicative of the poorer general condition and the many physical symptoms that can be related to the underlying, advanced disease stage in the STS patient population.

Common AEs associated with pazopanib in the STS population were fatigue (65%), diarrhoea (59%), nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension  (42%),  decreased  appetite  (40%)  and  hair colour changes (39%). These events were often severe; 49% and 10% of patients reported an AE of grade  3  or  grade  4  severity,  respectively.  The  most  common  grade  3  events  were  fatigue  (13%), tumour pain (8%), hypertension (7%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnoea (5%) and diarrhoea (5%).

The incidence of patients reporting SAEs was also relatively high in the pivotal study, particularly in the pazopanib arm (41%) compared to the placebo arm (24%). Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 24% of pazopanib-treated patients compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. The most common

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs associated with pazopanib were increased liver transaminases, pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). In comparison, the observed incidence of SAEs was 24% in the pazopanib arm in the pivotal RCC study. Eight (3%) of patients in the pazopanib arm had fatal  grade 5 events vs. 5% in the placebo arm. This is in line with what was observed in the RCC population. The most common cause of death was progressive disease (91%) in both treatment arms.

Pneumothorax and venous embolisms are newly identified risks in the STS population. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (demonstrated as decreased LVEF) was also reported in the RCC population but it seems to be a larger issue in the advanced STS population as these patients have often been pretreated with anthracyclines that are cardiotoxic. It appears that a higher percentage of subjects with decreased LVEF had current or a prior history of hypertension. The development of hypertension and the resulting increased cardiac after load may lead to exacerbation of a subclinical decreased LVEF due to  previous  treatment  with  anthracyclines.  The  sections  4.4  and  4.8  SmPC  have  been  adequately updated  in  order  to  inform  about  potential  risk  factors  (prior  anthracycline  therapy,  concurrent hypertension). Interruption of pazopanib and/or dose reduction should be combined with treatment of hypertension in patients with significant reductions in LVEF. This information is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore, a more detailed warning on cardiac dysfunction has been implemented in section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  reflect  that  the  risks  and  benefits  of  pazopanib  should  be considered before beginning therapy in patients who have pre-existing cardiac dysfunction, especially those  with  STS.    As  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  the  MAH  will  send  targeted  follow-up questionnaires to healthcare professionals who report LVEF decreases during treatment with pazopanib in  order  to  increase  the  collection  of  background  details.  Furthermore,  LVSD  will  be  included  in  the future PSURs. These measures are considered appropriate. Finally based on data from the pivotal RCC study  (VEG105192),  the  rate  of  LVSD  was  very  low  in  the  RCC  population  (and  similar  across treatment  arms)  despite  hypertension  being  a  common  AE  in  the  pazopanib  arm.  However,  LVEF assessments  were  not  obtained  regularly  in  that  study  as  it  has  been  done  in  the  ongoing  study VEG108844 study comparing pazopanib and sunitinib in RCC. Therefore the CHMP recommended the MAH to comment on this particular issue when submitting the CSR from study VEG108844 in June 2013.

Slightly more patients in the STS pivotal trial (20%) discontinued pazopanib due to AEs than in the RCC pivotal trial (15%).

The  MAH  has  performed  an  exploratory  'time  to  deterioration  of  PS'  analysis.  Patients  who experienced  a  confirmed  1  or  2  point  increase  in  their  WHO  score  from  baseline  or  death  were regarded  as  events  whereas  other  subjects  were  censored.  Although  these  results  should  be interpreted  with  caution  since  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  stayed  longer  on  treatment  and  had slightly  more PS scores than patients in the placebo arm, the Kaplan-Meier curves displayed a very similar pattern in terms of deterioration in PS across treatment arms over time.

## 2.6.2 Conclusions on clinical safety

Many of the safety findings from the trials in RCC patients have been confirmed in the STS population but  it  appears  that  the  burden  of  the  treatment  is  heavier  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  who  are heavily pre-treated, constitutively more symptomatic, in a poorer general condition and consequently more vulnerable when it comes to treatment-related toxicities. Relevant warnings and advice to the treating physician have been added to the SmPC on myocardial dysfunction and pneumothorax, the two new safety signals that have been observed.

Overall, the safety profile of pazopanib is still considered manageable and acceptable in the proposed indication.

SmPC Section 4.6 (Pregnancy and Lactation) and the package leaflet indicate that women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception and avoid becoming pregnant whilst taking pazopanib. Additionally, SmPC Section 4.6 and the package leaflet indicate that as the safe use of pazopanib during lactation has not been established, and as it is not known if pazopanib is excreted in human milk, breast feeding should be discontinued during pazopanib treatment. |

| The MAH should continue to collect information regarding potential risk factors development of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and discuss this issue in upcoming PSURS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PSUR submissions |
| Based on data from the pivotal RCC study (VEG105192), the rate of LVSD was very low in the RCC population (and similar across treatment arms) despite hypertension being a common AE in the pazopanib arm. However, LVEF assessments were not obtained regularly in that study as it has been done in the ongoing study VEG108844 study comparing pazopanib and sunitinib in RCC. The MAH is requested to comment on this particular issue when submitting the CSR from study VEG108844. | June 2013        |

## 2.8 Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order extend the indication of Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS).

During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI as discussed in detail above (see discussion on clinical efficacy):

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning about increased risk of pneumothorax in STS patients treated with pazopanib.

The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

## 2.9. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In the pivotal trial patients treated with pazopanib demonstrated a median PFS of 20.0 weeks vs. 7.0 weeks in patients treated with placebo by independent review. This results in a gain in median PFS of 13 weeks. The HR for PFS was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.48, p&lt; 0.001) which corresponds to a 65% reduction in the risk of progression or death in patients treated with pazopanib. This PFS benefit is considered  clinically  relevant.  Several  sensitivity  and  subgroups  analyses  consistently  support  the results of the primary PFS analysis.

Response  rates  were  low  (11%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  vs.  0%  in  the  placebo  arm  per  independent review), but more patients in the pazopanib arm obtained stable disease (54%) compared with the control arm (27%).

The supportive study VEG20002 showed activity for pazopanib and the endpoint as set for this study (progression-free rate ≥ 40%) was met in three out of the four histological subgroups of STS enrolled.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

According to eligibility criteria of study VEG110727 not only adipocytic sarcoma and GIST but also other histological subtypes of STS where excluded. The benefit of pazopanib in all these subgroups excluded from the study population is not proven, and therefore the benefit/risk is uncertain. Reference to these criteria under section 5.1 of the SmPC was considered appropriate to identify the target population.

Response  rates  were  low  (11%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  vs.  0%  in  the  placebo  arm),  however  more patients in the pazopanib arm obtained stable disease (54%) compared with the control arm (27%).

The  final  OS  analysis  from  trial  VEG110727  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  between pazopanib  and  placebo.  However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  trial  was  not  adequately  powered  to show differences in OS of less than four months.

In  terms  of  QoL,  a  numerical  trend  favouring  placebo  has  been  observed,  potentially  related  to  the negative impact of pazopanib-related toxicity (in particular fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea) on  the  QoL  of  patients  treated.  However,  an  exploratory  analysis  of  'time  to  deterioration  of performance status' including both onand post-therapy assessments of PS reassuringly demonstrated a very similar pattern in terms of deterioration in PS across treatment arms over time.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Practically all patients treated with pazopanib reported AEs (99%). Common AEs were well-known and included  fatigue  (65%),  diarrhoea  (59%),  nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension (42%),  decreased  appetite  (40%)  and  hair  colour  changes  (39%).  Severe  events  were  also  seen relatively  frequently;  49%  and  10%  of  patients  reported  an  AE  of  grade  3  or  grade  4  severity, respectively. The most common grade 3 events were fatigue (13%), tumour pain (8%), hypertension (7%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnoea (5%) and diarrhoea (5%). The incidence of SAEs was also high in the pazopanib arm (41%) compared to the placebo arm (24%). Treatment-related SAEs were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported in 24%  of pazopanib-treated patients and included increased liver transaminases, pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue and LVSD. The proportion of pazopanib-treated patients experienced fatal grade 5 events was 3%.

Newly identified risks to the STS population that have been associated with pazopanib are pneumothorax and myocardial dysfunction. Pneumothorax was reported in 15 (4%) of the 382 pazopanib-treated STS patients. Congestive heart failure was reported in 2 out of 382 patients (0.5 %) in the STS population. Decreases in LVEF in subjects who had post-baseline measurement were detected in 11 % (15/140) in the pazopanib arm compared with 3 % (1/39) in the placebo arm.

Both pneumothorax and cardiac dysfunction are considered as identified risks for pazopanib therapy.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The  pathogenesis  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  myocardial  dysfunction  AEs  observed  in  STS patients  treated  with  pazopanib  are  not  completely  clear.  Routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance activities  (see  Table  28  above)  are  expected  to  provide  further  information  on  the  these  adverse events.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 65% and an improvement of 13 weeks in median PFS represents an important benefit to patients. In addition, the benefit of PFS in the pivotal study has proven to be very robust in sensitivity analyses and consistent in subgroup analyses.

The  characteristic  safety  findings  of  pazopanib  were  overall  similar  to  previous  findings  in  RCC patients, but the tolerability was poorer in patients with advanced STS. It appears that the burden of the  treatment  is  heavier  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  who  are  heavily  pre-treated,  constitutively more symptomatic, in a poorer general condition and consequently more vulnerable when it comes to treatment-related  toxicities. Overall, the safety profile is  considered  acceptable  and  generally manageable.

The safety findings of pazopanib were overall similar to previous findings in RCC patients. New safety concerns have been identified as well however these are generally manageable and relevant warnings with  very  detailed  recommendations  regarding  monitoring  and  further  lines  to  take  have  been adequate provided.

## Discussion on the benefit risk balance

The benefit-risk balance for pazopanib for the treatment of patients with selective subtypes of advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy is considered positive as the

demonstrated statistically significant improvement of PFS outweighs the added toxicity of pazopanib in this target population with a high unmet medical need.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   |                                                                                                                | Type   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a              | Change to therapeutic indication - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order extend the indication of Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Votrient is not similar to Yondelis within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1.

## Additional data/Market exclusivity

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2).

## Paediatric Data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan and the results are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
