For procedures finalised after 1 october 2004 please refer to module 8B.

- On 21 January 2000 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA an application for a Type I variation relating to the increase of batch size of the active substance. On 15 March 2000  the  EMEA  has  notified  the  European  Commission  that  the  change  was  accepted. The European Commission amended the Decision on 27 April 2000.
- On 12 June  2000  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  notified  the  EMEA  of  its  intention  to introduce changes in the Labelling and the Package Leaflet not connected to the Summary of Product Characteristics. On 7 August 2000 the EMEA has notified the European Commission that  the  changes  were  accepted.  The  European  Commission  amended  the  Decision  on 29 September 2000.
- On 25 August 2000 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA an application for a Type I variation relating to a minor change in the manufacturing process. On 19 October 2000 the  EMEA has notified the European  Commission that the change was accepted.

| Changes in Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Labelling and Package leaflet (PL). Following 1st PSUR (14 August 1999 - 13 February 2000), as well as the discussion held at the PVWP in July 2000: - In section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) of the SPC, to amend an existing warning on the risk of allergic and anaphylactic reactions and the necessity to have medications for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions available for immediate use following administration of palivizumab. - In section 4.8 (Undesirable effects), to add 'Apnoea' in the list of rare ADRs reported during post-marketing experience, and 'Anaphylaxis', as very rare ADRs (<1/10.000). - To amend the PL, in accordance with the information added in the SPC. Moreover, the MAHtook the opportunity of this variation to implement the newly assigned ATC code in section 5.1 of the SPC | II-0005              | II                       | 25.01.01                            | 01.06.01                                |
