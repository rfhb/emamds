Medicinal Product no longer authorised ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each 0.8 ml single dose vial contains 40 mg of adalimumab. Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Trudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Ankylosing spondylitis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Crohn's disease

<!-- image -->

Trudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn's disease, in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. For induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with cortiocosteroids.  Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with corticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Trudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card.

Some patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. During treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. Adults Rheumatoid arthritis The recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be continued during treatment with Trudexa. Glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week. Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis The recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. For all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Crohn's disease The recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80  mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Trudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous dose. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Elderly patients No dose adjustment is required. Children and adolescents There is no experience in children. Impaired renal and/or hepatic function Trudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Infections Patients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. Treatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localized infections until infections are controlled. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored closely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have been reported with Trudexa. Serious infections: In clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, and reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are infections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia. Tuberculosis:

There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the majority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

Serious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa during clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during clinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported very rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local recommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Trudexa. Other opportunistic infections: There have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa therapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. If a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general deterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. Hepatitis B Reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, who are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Neurological events TNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central nervous system demyelinating disorders. Allergic reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.

## Immunosuppression

Medicinal Product no longer authorised In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. Haematologic reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation of Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. Vaccinations Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Congestive heart failure

In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Autoimmune processes

Treatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of longterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be given (see section 4.8).

It is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. Surgery There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving Trudexa. Small bowel obstruction Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause strictures. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Trudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when Trudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF α , adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment. Use during lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Medicinal Product no longer authorised No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Clinical Trials Trudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based on the controlled Studies (I -IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) involving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM was 5.7% for patients taking Trudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. Adverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100 &lt; 1/10; uncommon ≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare &lt; 1/1000 in Table 1 below.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1 Undesirable Effects in Clinical Studies

## Injection site reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the twelve controlled trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving placebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Infections In the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated patients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most patients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved. The incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control -treated patients. In controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders During the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among 2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 control patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for controltreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, 12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 (0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patientyears among control patients. When combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label extension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over 13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. In post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies

Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis Studies I -V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active control -treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.  The patients

improved following discontinuation of therapy.  No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I -IV), elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more common in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy arm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. Psoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients (Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. In all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. Crohn's disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo. Additional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials The additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or Phase IV clinical trials: Table 2 Undesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.  The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 Mechanism of action Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.

Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

After treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.

The primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.  Study III and V had an

Clinical trials Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients were treated for  up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of 20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. Study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexateintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of Trudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 months. Study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of Trudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks.

The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 3.

In Study III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were maintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There were 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months. Among those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. In Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p &lt; 0.001). In Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. In Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at week 104 (see Table 4).

The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Radiographic response In Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label extension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained for 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years.

Quality of life and physical function Health-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies I, III, IV). In Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of open-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. In Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 showed greater improvement (p &lt; 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through week 104. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7).

Similar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double -blind, placebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a severe disease (CDAI score &gt; 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and GAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. CLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9.

In CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis.  Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other anti-TNF therapy.  Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 10.  Clinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF antagonist exposure.

These results suggest that some patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).

## Immunogenicity

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and adverse events. Patients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 (5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% (24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with Crohn's disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) treated with adalimumab. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase halflife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µ g/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µ g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In patients with Crohn's disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µ g/ml during the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µ g/ml during the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µ g/ml were observed in Crohn's disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with measurable AAA.  Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of neutralizing antibodies in rodents. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each 0.8 ml single dose pre-filled syringe contains 40 mg of adalimumab. Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Trudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Ankylosing spondylitis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Crohn's disease

Trudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn's disease, in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. For induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with corticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Trudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card.

Some patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. During treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. Adults Rheumatoid arthritis The recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be continued during treatment with Trudexa. Glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week. Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis The recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. For all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Crohn's disease The recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Trudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous dose. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Elderly patients No dose adjustment is required. Children and adolescents There is no experience in children. Impaired renal and/or hepatic function Trudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Infections Patients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. Treatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localized infections until infections are controlled. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored closely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have been reported with Trudexa. Serious infections: In clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, and reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are infections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia. Tuberculosis:

There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the majority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

Serious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa during clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during clinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported very rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local recommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Trudexa. Other opportunistic infections: There have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa therapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. If a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general deterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. Hepatitis B Reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, who are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Neurological events TNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central nervous system demyelinating disorders. Allergic reactions

The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.

## Immunosuppression

Medicinal Product no longer authorised In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. Haematologic reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation of Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. Vaccinations Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Congestive heart failure

In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Autoimmune processes

Treatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of longterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be given (see section 4.8).

It is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. Surgery There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving Trudexa. Small bowel obstruction Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause strictures. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Trudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when Trudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF α , adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment. Use during lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Medicinal Product no longer authorised No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Clinical Trials Trudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based on the controlled Studies (I -IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) involving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM was 5.7% for patients taking Trudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. Adverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100 &lt; 1/10; uncommon ≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare &lt; 1/1000 in Table 1 below.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1 Undesirable Effects in Clinical Studies

## Injection site reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the twelve controlled trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving placebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Infections In the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated patients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most patients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved. The incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control -treated patients. In controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders During the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among 2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 control patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for controltreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, 12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 (0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patientyears among control patients. When combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label extension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over 13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. In post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies

Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis Studies I -V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active control -treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.  The patients

improved following discontinuation of therapy.  No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I -IV), elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more common in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy arm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. Psoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients (Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. In all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. Crohn's disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo. Additional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials The additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or Phase IV clinical trials: Table 2 Undesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.  The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 Mechanism of action Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.

Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

After treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.

The primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.  Study III and V had an

Clinical trials Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients were treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of 20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. Study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexateintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of Trudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 months. Study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of Trudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks.

The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 3.

In Study III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were maintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There were 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months. Among those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. In Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p &lt; 0.001). In Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. In Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at week 104 (see Table 4).

The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Radiographic response In Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label extension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained for 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less.

All doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52.

A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies I, III, IV). In Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of open-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. In Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 showed greater improvement (p &lt; 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through week 104. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7).

Similar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double -blind, placebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a severe disease (CDAI score &gt; 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and GAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. CLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9.

In CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis.  Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other anti-TNF therapy.  Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 10.  Clinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF antagonist exposure.

These results suggest that some patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).

## Immunogenicity

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and adverse events. Patients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 (5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% (24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with Crohn's disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) treated with adalimumab. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase halflife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µ g/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µ g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In patients with Crohn's disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µ g/ml during the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µ g/ml during the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µ g/ml were observed in Crohn's disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with measurable AAA.  Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of neutralizing antibodies in rodents. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with needleguard

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each 0.8 ml single dose pre-filled syringe contains 40 mg of adalimumab. Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with needleguard. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Trudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Ankylosing spondylitis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Crohn's disease

Trudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn's disease, in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. For induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with corticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Trudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card.

Some patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. During treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. Adults Rheumatoid arthritis The recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be continued during treatment with Trudexa. Glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week. Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis The recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. For all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Crohn's disease The recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Trudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous dose. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Elderly patients No dose adjustment is required. Children and adolescents There is no experience in children. Impaired renal and/or hepatic function Trudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Infections Patients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. Treatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localized infections until infections are controlled. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored closely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have been reported with Trudexa. Serious infections: In clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, and reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are infections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia. Tuberculosis:

There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the majority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

Serious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa during clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during clinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported very rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local recommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Trudexa. Other opportunistic infections: There have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa therapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. If a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general deterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. Hepatitis B Reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, who are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Neurological events TNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central nervous system demyelinating disorders. Allergic reactions

## Immunosuppression

Medicinal Product no longer authorised In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. Haematologic reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation of Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. Vaccinations Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Congestive heart failure

In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Autoimmune processes

Treatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of longterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be given (see section 4.8).

It is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. Surgery There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving Trudexa. Small bowel obstruction Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause strictures. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Trudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when Trudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF α , adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment. Use during lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Medicinal Product no longer authorised No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Clinical Trials Trudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based on the controlled Studies (I -IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) involving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM was 5.7% for patients taking Trudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. Adverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100 &lt; 1/10; uncommon ≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare &lt; 1/1000 in Table 1 below.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1 Undesirable Effects in Clinical Studies

In the twelve controlled trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving placebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Infections In the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated patients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most patients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved. The incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control -treated patients. In controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders During the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among 2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 control patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for controltreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, 12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 (0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patientyears among control patients. When combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label extension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over 13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. In post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4). Autoantibodies

Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis Studies I -V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active control -treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.  The patients

improved following discontinuation of therapy.  No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I -IV), elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more common in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy arm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. Psoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients (Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. In all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. Crohn's disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo. Additional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials The additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or Phase IV clinical trials: Table 2 Undesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.  The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17 Mechanism of action Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.

Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

After treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.

The primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.  Study III and V had an

Clinical trials Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients were treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of 20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. Study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexateintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of Trudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 months. Study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of Trudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised The percent of Trudexa-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across trials I, II and III.  The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 3.

In Study III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were maintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There were 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months. Among those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. In Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p &lt; 0.001). In Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. In Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at week 104 (see Table 4).

Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p &lt; 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (p &lt; 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.  The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Radiographic response In Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label extension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained for 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less.

Quality of life and physical function Health-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies I, III, IV). In Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of open-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. In Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 showed greater improvement (p &lt; 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through week 104. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7).

Medicinal Product no longer authorised a ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis b Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index Trudexa treated patients had significantly greater improvement at Week 12 which was maintained through Week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL). Similar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double -blind, placebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a severe disease (CDAI score &gt; 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and GAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. CLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9.

In CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis.  Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other anti-TNF therapy.  Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 10.  Clinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF antagonist exposure.

These results suggest that some patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).

## Immunogenicity

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and adverse events. Patients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 (5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% (24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with Crohn's disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) treated with adalimumab. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase halflife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µ g/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µ g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In patients with Crohn's disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µ g/ml during the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µ g/ml during the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µ g/ml were observed in Crohn's disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with measurable AAA.  Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of neutralizing antibodies in rodents. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each 0.8 ml single dose pre-filled pen contains 40 mg of adalimumab. Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre-filled pen. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Trudexa has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. Psoriatic arthritis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Ankylosing spondylitis Trudexa is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Crohn's disease

Trudexa is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn's disease, in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For induction treatment, Trudexa should be given in combination with corticosteroids.  Trudexa can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to corticosteroids or when continued treatment with corticosteroids is inappropriate (see section 4.2).

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 4.2 Posology and method of administration Trudexa treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease.  Patients treated with Trudexa should be given the special alert card. After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Trudexa if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. During treatment with Trudexa, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. Adults Rheumatoid arthritis The recommended dose of Trudexa for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection.  Methotrexate should be continued during treatment with Trudexa. Glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during treatment with Trudexa.  Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week. Psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis The recommended dose of Trudexa for patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. For all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Crohn's disease The recommended Trudexa induction dose regimen for adult patients with severe Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2.  In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection.  Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Trudexa and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Trudexa may be re-administered.  There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous dose.

During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dose intensity to 40 mg Trudexa every week.

Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Elderly patients No dose adjustment is required. Children and adolescents There is no experience in children. Impaired renal and/or hepatic function Trudexa has not been studied in these patient populations.  No dose recommendations can be made. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Infections Patients must be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Trudexa.  Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to five months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. Treatment with Trudexa should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localized infections until infections are controlled. Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Trudexa should be monitored closely.  Administration of Trudexa should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection until infections are controlled.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Trudexa in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Serious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, including fatalities, have been reported with Trudexa. Serious infections: In clinical trials an increased risk of serious infections in patients receiving Trudexa has been shown, and reports from the post-marketing setting support this finding.  Of particular importance are infections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia.

## Tuberculosis:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Trudexa.  It should be noted that in the majority of those reports, tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary, i.e. disseminated.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Before initiation of therapy with Trudexa, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection.  This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with a personal history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to patients with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy.  Appropriate screening tests, i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply).  It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient alert card.  Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Trudexa therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis in accordance with local recommendations must be initiated before starting treatment with Trudexa.  In this situation, the benefit/risk balance of therapy with Trudexa should be very carefully considered. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Trudexa. Other opportunistic infections: There have been reports of serious and severe opportunistic infections associated with Trudexa therapy, for example pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disseminated histoplasmosis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. If a patient receiving Trudexa shows prolonged/atypical symptoms/signs of infections or general deterioration, prevalent opportunistic conditions must be considered. Hepatitis B Reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Trudexa, who are chronic carriers of this virus.  Some cases have had fatal outcome.  Patients at risk for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating Trudexa therapy. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Trudexa should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.  Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available.  In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Trudexa should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Neurological events TNF-antagonists including Trudexa have been associated in rare cases with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease.  Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Trudexa in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central nervous system demyelinating disorders. Allergic reactions

<!-- image -->

Serious allergic adverse reactions have not been reported with subcutaneous administration of Trudexa during clinical trials.  Non-serious allergic reactions associated with Trudexa were uncommon during clinical trials.  In postmarketing, serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported very rarely following Trudexa administration.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reaction occurs, administration of Trudexa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.

In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed.  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving Trudexa.  Trudexa should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II).  Trudexa is contraindicated in moderate to severe

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Immunosuppression In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Trudexa, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-and B cells and NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients.  However, the occurrence was rare.  Furthermore, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation.  With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or that continue treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving Trudexa.  Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Trudexa treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another anti-TNF agent, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. Haematologic reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents.  Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Trudexa.  All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Trudexa.  Discontinuation of Trudexa therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. Vaccinations Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Trudexa.  Patients on Trudexa may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Congestive heart failure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

heart failure (see section 4.3).  Treatment with Trudexa must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.

## Autoimmune processes

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Treatment with Trudexa may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of longterm treatment with Trudexa on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Trudexa and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Trudexa should not be given (see section 4.8). Concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone.  Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists.  Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. Surgery There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Trudexa.  The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned.  A patient who requires surgery while on Trudexa should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken.  There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving Trudexa. Small bowel obstruction Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment.  Available data suggest that Trudexa does not worsen or cause strictures. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Trudexa has been studied both in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking Trudexa as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate.  Antibody formation was lower when Trudexa was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of Trudexa without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation For Trudexa, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity.  Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity and fertility effects of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF α , adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn.  Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.

## Use during lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion.

However, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at least five months after the last Trudexa treatment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Clinical Trials Trudexa was studied in 5293 patients in controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months.  These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease as well as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease patients.  The data in Table 1 is based on the controlled Studies (I -IX,CLASSIC I, GAIN AND CHARM) (described in section 5.1) involving 3271 patients receiving Trudexa and 1809 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM was 5.7% for patients taking Trudexa and 5.3% for control treated patients. Adverse events at least possibly causally-related to adalimumab for Studies I -IX, CLASSIC I, GAIN and CHARM, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/10; common ≥ 1/100 &lt; 1/10; uncommon ≥ 1/1000  to ≤ 1/100) and rare &lt; 1/1000 in Table 1 below.

## Injection site reactions

Medicinal Product no longer authorised In the twelve controlled trials, 16% of patients treated with Trudexa developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 10% of patients receiving placebo or active control.  Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. Infections In the twelve controlled trials, the rate of infection was 1.49 per patient year in the Trudexa treated patients and 1.42 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients.  The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and urinary tract infections.  Most patients continued on Trudexa after the infection resolved. The incidence of serious infections was 0.03 per patient year in Trudexa treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control -treated patients. In controlled and open label studies with Trudexa, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, aspergillosis and listeriosis).  Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders During the controlled portions of ten Trudexa trials at least 12 weeks in duration (I-IX and CHARM) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 5.7 (3.3, 10.1) per 1000 patient-years among 2887 Trudexa treated patients versus a rate of 4.1 (1.5, 10.9) 1 per 1000 patient-years among 1570 control patients (median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for Trudexa and 5.5 months for controltreated patients).  The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 7.6 (4.7, 12.4) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 2.0 (0.5, 8.2) per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.0, 5.7) per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 0 per 1000 patient-years among control patients.  The rate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 1.0 (0.2, 3.8)  per 1000 patient-years among Trudexa-treated patients and 1.0 (0.1, 7.3) per 1000 patientyears among control patients. When combining controlled portions of ten trials (I-IX and CHARM) and ongoing open label extension studies with a median duration of approximately 2. years including 4843 patients and over 13000 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 13.6 per 1000 patient years.  The observed rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.0 per 1000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.2 per 1000 patient years. In post-marketing experience from January 2003, predominately in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies other than lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 1.7 per 1000 patient years.  The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4).

## Autoantibodies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis Studies I -V.  In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with Trudexa and 8.1% of placebo and active control -treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24.  Two patients out of 3441 treated with Trudexa in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome.  The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy.  No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Liver Enzyme Elevations Rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials: in controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (Studies I -IV), elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo.  In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration of less than 3 years) (Study V), elevations of ALT were more common in the combination arm (Trudexa /methotrexate) compared to the methotrexate monotherapy arm or the Trudexa monotherapy arm. Psoriatic arthritis clinical trials: elevations in ALT were more common in psoriatic arthritis patients (Studies VI-VII) compared with patients in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. In all studies (I-VII), patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. Crohn's disease clinical trials: in controlled clinical trials, elevations of ALT were similar in patients receiving adalimumab or placebo. Additional Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Surveillance or Phase IV Clinical Trials The additional adverse reactions in Table 2 have been reported from postmarketing surveillance or Phase IV clinical trials: Table 2 Undesirable Effects in Postmarketing Surveillance and Phase IV Clinical Studies 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressive agents.  ATC code: L04AA17

Mechanism of action

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.

Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M).

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Pharmacodynamic effects After treatment with Trudexa, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after Trudexa administration.  Patients treated with Trudexa usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease. Clinical trials Rheumatoid arthritis Trudexa was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials.  Some patients were treated for up to 60 months duration.  The efficacy and safety of Trudexa for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week.  Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of Trudexa or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.  Doses of 20 or 40 mg of Trudexa were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. Study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had insufficient efficacy to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexateintolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 12.5 to 25 mg every week. There were three groups in this study.  The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of Trudexa every week for 52 weeks.  The third group received 40 mg of Trudexa every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks.  Thereafter, patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of Trudexa was administered every other week up to 60 months. Study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old.  Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days.  These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts.  Patients were randomised to 40 mg of Trudexa or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.

Study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months).  This study evaluated the efficacy of Trudexa 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, Trudexa 40 mg every other week

In Study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with Trudexa and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at week 104 (see Table 4).

Medicinal Product no longer authorised The primary end point in Studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in Study IV was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.  The primary endpoint in Study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52.  Study III and V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results).  Study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. ACR response The percent of Trudexa-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across trials I, II and III.  The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 3.

In Study III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  In addition, ACR response rates were maintained in the majority of patients followed in the open-label extension phase to week 104.  There were 114 out of 207 patients who continued on Humira 40 mg every other week for 60 months. Among those, 86, 72, and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively at month 60. In Study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with Trudexa plus standard of care was statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p &lt; 0.001). In Studies I-IV, Trudexa-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.

Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p &lt; 0.001) and Trudexa monotherapy (p &lt; 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.  The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Radiographic response In Study III, where Trudexa treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified total Sharp score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score.  Trudexa/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 5).  Data from the open-label extension phase indicate that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained for 60 months in a subset of patients.  113/207 of patients originally treated with 40 mg Humira every other week were evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Among those, 66 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less.

Trudexa, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, Studies VI and VII.  Study VI with 24 week duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate.  Study VII with 12-week duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy.

Quality of life and physical function Health-related quality of life and physical function was assessed using the disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in Study III.  All doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in Study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of Trudexa in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose.  A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (Studies I, III, IV). In Study III, improvement in physical function was maintained through week  260 (60 months) of open-label treatment.  Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. In Study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 showed greater improvement (p &lt; 0.001) for Trudexa/methotrexate combination therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy and Trudexa monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through week 104. Psoriatic arthritis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Trudexa in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied (see Table 7).

Trudexa treated patients demonstrated improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36), from base-line to week 24. Ankylosing spondylitis Trudexa 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double -blind, placebo -controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  Seventy-nine (20.1%) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti -rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) patients with glucocorticoids.  The blinded period was followed by an open -label period during which patients received Trudexa 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks.  Subjects (n=215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at Weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. In the larger study (VIII) with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with Trudexa compared to placebo. Significant response was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (Table 8).

Medicinal Product no longer authorised ***,** Statistically significant at p &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons between Trudexa and placebo at Weeks 2, 12 and  24 a ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis b Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index Trudexa treated patients had significantly greater improvement at Week 12 which was maintained through Week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL). Similar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double -blind, placebo controlled study (IX) of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of Trudexa were assessed in over 1400 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  478 of the enrolled patients (32%) were defined as having  a severe disease (CDAI score &gt; 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1).  Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies, CLASSIC I and GAIN.  In CLASSIC I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2.  In GAIN, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg Trudexa at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2.  The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CHARM.  In CHARM, 854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2.  At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks.  Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4.  Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. CLASSIC I and GAIN induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 9.

## Quality of Life

Medicinal Product no longer authorised All p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for Trudexa versus placebo * p &lt; 0.001 ** p &lt; 0.01 Similar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 and adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. In CHARM, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis.  Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to other anti-TNF therapy.  Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 10.  Clinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF antagonist exposure. Table 10: Maintenance of Clinical Remission and Response (Percent of Patients) * p &lt; 0.001 for Trudexa versus placebo pairwise comparisons   of proportions ** p &lt; 0.02 for Trudexa versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions a Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline Among patients who were not in response at week 4, 43% of Trudexa maintenance patients responded by week 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients.  These results suggest that some patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12.  Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).

In CLASSIC I and GAIN, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to

Trudexa 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CHARM as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group.

## Immunogenicity

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab.  There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and adverse events. Patients in Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple timepoints for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6 to 12 month period.  In the pivotal trials, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 58/1053 (5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 2/370 (0.5%) on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 38/376 subjects (10%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.5% (24/178 subjects), compared to 7% (14 of 198 subjects) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis antibodies were identified in 17/204 subjects (8.3%) treated with adalimumab.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 16/185 (8.6%), compared to 1/19 (5.3%) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. In patients with Crohn's disease, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7/269 subjects (2.6%) treated with adalimumab. Because immunogenicity analyses are product-specific, comparison of antibody rates with those from other products is not appropriate. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.  The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%.  After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional.  After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase halflife was approximately two weeks.  Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Trudexa every other week in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µ g/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µ g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.  The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In patients with Crohn's disease, the loading dose of 80 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 40 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µ g/ml during the induction period.  A loading dose of 160 mg Trudexa on week 0 followed by 80 mg Trudexa on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µ g/ml during the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µ g/ml were observed in Crohn's disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg Trudexa every other week.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight.  After adjustment for weight differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance.  The serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with measurable AAA.  Trudexa has not been studied in children or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomologous monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab.  Carcinogenicity studies, and standard assessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and the development of neutralizing antibodies in rodents. 6.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. -Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. -Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment with Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card together with the package leaflet. -If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet : 1. What Trudexa is and what it is used for 2. Before you use Trudexa 3. How to use Trudexa 4. Possible side effects 5 How to store Trudexa 6. Further information 1. WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Trudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein (tumour necrosis factor or TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. Trudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. Trudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. Usually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. Psoriatic arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ankylosing spondylitis

Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA Do not use Trudexa: · If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa. · If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see 'Take special care with Trudexa').  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. · If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see 'Take special care with Trudexa'). Take special care with Trudexa: · If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. · The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be advised to avoid touching the inner shield. · If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including serious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.

- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking Trudexa.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. · Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. · If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. · There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other TNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. · Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. Using other medicines Trudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. You should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Using Trudexa with food and drink Since Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. Pregnancy and breast-feeding The effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant women is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.

It is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during Trudexa treatment and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.

The usual dose regimen for Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week 2.  In cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor may prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other week.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You should continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you. In rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. If you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Trudexa therapy, your doctor may decide to give 40 mg adalimumab every week. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Trudexa: The following instructions explain how to inject Trudexa.  Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.  You will be instructed by your doctor or his/her assistant on the technique of self-injection.  Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection.  After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a family member or friend. This injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. 1) Setting up · Wash your hands thoroughly · Set up the following items on a clean surface o One vial of Trudexa for injection o One syringe with fixed needle o Two alcohol pads

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · Look at the expiry date on the vial.  Do not use the product after the month and year shown. 2) Choosing and preparing an injection site · Choose a site on your thigh or stomach · Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site. o Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  This may mean there is an infection. o Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. o Do not touch the area again before injecting. 3) Injecting Trudexa Preparing the Trudexa dose for injection · Do NOT shake the vial. · Remove the plastic cap from the Trudexa vial.  Do NOT remove the grey stopper or aluminium ring around the top of the vial. · Use a new alcohol pad to clean the grey stopper on the vial.  After cleaning, do not touch the stopper with your hands. · Remove cap from needle syringe, being careful not to touch needle or let it touch any surface. · Make sure that the plunger is fully inserted into the syringe.  With the vial upright on a flat surface, such as a table, insert the needle straight through the centre ring of the grey stopper.  If the needle is correctly lined up, you should feel a slight resistance and then a 'pop' as the needle goes through the centre of the stopper.  Look for the needle tip inside the stopper window.  If the needle is not correctly lined up with the centre of the stopper, you will feel constant resistance as it goes through the stopper and no 'pop.'  The needle may then enter at an angle and bend, break or prevent proper removal of the vial contents.  If this happens, do not use the syringe or vial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- With the needle still in the vial, turn the vial upside down at eye level.  Check that the needle is below the surface of the solution.  Slowly pull the plunger back to draw solution into the syringe.
- With the needle still inserted in the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles.  Gently tap the syringe to make any bubbles rise to the top of the syringe near the needle.  Slowly press the plunger to push the bubbles out of the syringe and into the vial.  When you do this, if you accidentally push some solution back into the vial, pull slowly back in the plunger to draw the entire contents of the vial back into the syringe.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · Pull the needle completely out of the vial.  Again, do NOT touch the needle or let it touch any surface. Injecting Trudexa · With one hand, gently grasp the cleaned areas of skin and hold firmly · With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin, with the grooved side up. · With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin · Release the skin with the first hand · Push plunger to inject solution - it can take from 2 to 5 seconds to empty the syringe · When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to keep it at the same angle as when it was inserted · Using your thumb or a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds.  A little bleeding may occur.  Do not rub the injection site.  Use a plaster if you want to. 4) Throwing away supplies · The Trudexa syringe should NEVER be reused. NEVER recap a needle · After injecting Trudexa, immediately throw away the used syringe in a special container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. · Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children If you use more Trudexa than you should: If you accidentally inject Trudexa more frequently than told to by your doctor, you should call your doctor and tell him/her that you have taken more.  Always take the outer carton or the vial of medicine with you, even if it is empty. If you forget to take Trudexa: If you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Trudexa as soon as you remember.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET:  INFORMATION FOR THE USER

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Adalimumab

<!-- image -->

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment with Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card together with the package leaflet. -If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet : 1. What Trudexa is and what it is used for 2. Before you use Trudexa 3. How to use Trudexa 4. Possible side effects 5 How to store Trudexa 6. Further information 1. WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Trudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein (tumour necrosis factor or TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. Trudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. Trudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. Usually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. Psoriatic arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ankylosing spondylitis

Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA Do not use Trudexa: · If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa. · If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see 'Take special care with Trudexa').  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. · If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see 'Take special care with Trudexa'). Take special care with Trudexa: · If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. · The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be advised to avoid touching the inner shield. · If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including serious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.

- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking Trudexa.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. · Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. · If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. · There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other TNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. · Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. Using other medicines Trudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. You should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Using Trudexa with food and drink Since Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. Pregnancy and breast-feeding The effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant women is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.

It is not known whether adalimumab passes into breast milk.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET:  INFORMATION FOR THE USER

Trudexa 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe with needleguard Adalimumab

<!-- image -->

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine. -Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. -Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before you are given Trudexa and during treatment with Trudexa.  Keep this Patient Alert Card with the package leaflet. -If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet : 1. What Trudexa is and what it is used for 2. Before you use Trudexa 3. How to use Trudexa 4. Possible side effects 5 How to store Trudexa 6. Further information 1. WHAT TRUDEXA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Trudexa is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is a medicine that decreases the inflammation process of these diseases.  The active ingredient, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells.  Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique proteins.  Adalimumab binds to a specific protein (tumour necrosis factor or TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. Trudexa can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. Trudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. Usually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. Psoriatic arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ankylosing spondylitis

Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine.  If you have ankylosing spondylitis you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  If you have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines.  If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Trudexa to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 2. BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA Do not use Trudexa: · If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa. · If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see 'Take special care with Trudexa').  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. · If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see 'Take special care with Trudexa'). Take special care with Trudexa: · If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. · The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be advised to avoid touching the inner shield. · If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including serious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare case, be life-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV.  Trudexa can cause reactivation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HBV in people who carry this virus.  In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.

- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking Trudexa.

The effects of Trudexa in pregnant women are not known and so the use of Trudexa in pregnant women is not recommended.  You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Trudexa and for at least 5 months after the last Trudexa treatment.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa · Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. · If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  Your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. · There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other TNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. · Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. Using other medicines Trudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. You should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Using Trudexa with food and drink Since Trudexa is given subcutaneously, food and drink should not affect Trudexa. Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Trudexa has been shown to slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. Usually, Trudexa is used with methotrexate.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone. Psoriatic arthritis

BEFORE YOU USE TRUDEXA Do not use Trudexa: · If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of Trudexa. · If you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see 'Take special care with Trudexa').  It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. · If you have moderate or severe heart failure.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see 'Take special care with Trudexa'). Take special care with Trudexa: · If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Trudexa and contact your doctor immediately. · The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).  This may cause severe allergic reactions in patients sensitive to latex.  Patients who have a known sensitivity to latex should be advised to avoid touching the inner shield. · If you have an infection, including long-term or localized infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Trudexa.  If you are unsure, please contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Trudexa treatment including serious infections, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening.  It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Trudexa, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Trudexa.  This will include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test.  The conduct of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Alert Card.  It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.  If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicinal Product no longer authorised · If you have multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. · Some vaccines should not be given while receiving Trudexa.  Please check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. · If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Trudexa , your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor.  It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition.  If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  Your doctor will decide if you should receive Trudexa. · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight infections or help you to stop bleeding.  If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away.  Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. · There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Trudexa or other TNF blockers.  People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma.  If you take Trudexa your risk may increase.  In addition very rare cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Trudexa. · Cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker.  If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. Using other medicines Trudexa can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. You should not take Trudexa with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra.  If you have questions, please ask your doctor.

Trudexa is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use).  The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg adalimumab given every other week as a single dose.  The usual dose regimen for Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 and followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week 2. I n cases where a more rapid response is required your doctor may prescribe a dose of 160 mg at week 0 (as 4 injections in one day or 2 injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg (2 injections) at week 2, and thereafter as 40 mg (1 injection) every other week.  Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose to 40 mg every week.  You should continue to inject Trudexa for as long as your doctor has told you. In rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Trudexa.  If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Trudexa can be given alone.

Do not use a pre-filled pen that is frozen or if it has been left in direct sunlight. Where should I give my injection? 1. Choose a site on the top of your thigh or stomach (except the area around the navel).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicinal Product no longer authorised How do I give my injection? 1. Wipe your skin by using the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion.  Do not touch the area again before injecting. 2. Hold the pre-filled pen with one hand with the grey cap (1) pointed down.  With your other hand, pull the grey cap (1) straight off and discard cap.  Check that the small grey needle cover of the syringe has been removed with the cap.  The white needle sleeve will now be exposed. Do not try to touch the needle housed in the barrel. DO NOT RECAP as you may damage the needle inside. 3. Pull the plum safety cap (labelled '2') straight off to expose the plum coloured activation button at the top.  The pre-filled pen is now ready to use.  Do not press the plum activation button until properly positioned as this will result in discharge of medication. DO NOT RECAP as this could cause the unit to discharge. Giving the injection 1. With your free hand, gently grasp a sizable area of the cleaned skin at the injection site and hold firmly (see below). 2.

Holding the barrel of the pre-filled pen, press down slightly onto the injection site (holding in place without moving). 4. With your index finger or your thumb, press the plum coloured button on top once you are ready to begin the injection (see below).  You will then hear a 'click' as the needle is released, and you will feel a small prick as the needle advances. 5. Keep pressing and continue to hold the pre-filled pen with steady pressure in place for about 10 seconds to ensure a complete injection. Do not remove the pre-filled pen while the injection is being given.
