## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for busulfan, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing busulfan were warranted.

Seven literature reports have been published cumulatively concerning disturbance in dental development. In one article it was studied the role of busulfan in juvenile rats resulting in abnormal root development;  a  review  of  two  cases  of  immunodeficiency  disorders  treated  with  busulfan  and cyclophosphamide  in  which  dental  orthodontic  treatment  was  provided;  additional  2  case  report  of hypoplasia  of  permanent  tooth  germ  is  presented;  one  review  assessed  the  long  term  effects  of cytotoxic therapy concluding that tooth agenesis was more prevalent in patients treated with busulfan and  cyclophosphamide;  a  study  of  81  patients  concluded  that  busulfan  is  as  toxic  as  total  body irradiation  in  causing  disturbances  in  dental  development;  finally,  a  study  of  risk  factors  of  tooth formation anomalies in paediatric cancers concluded that the high risk group of tooth agenesis was the subject  with  high  dose  chemotherapy  under  4  years  old.  From  the  assessment  of  these  articles,  the causality of busulfan in the development of tooth hypoplasia is confirmed. Therefore, 'tooth hypoplasia' should be added to the product information for both pharmaceutical forms. Interaction  between  busulfan  and  metronidazol  has  been  reported  in  literature  reviews  and  post marketing cases. It is of particular interest the study of this interaction in three groups of patients in which higher plasma levels of busulfan were observed in the group receiving metronidazol prophylaxis during busulfan treatment than in those without metronidazoles. Therefore, this interaction should be included in the product information for both pharmaceutical forms. The signal concerning interaction with deferasirox is refuted and it can be closed. This signal was open based on an isolated case from the literature and no additional cases have been reported. No pharmacokinetic explanation justifies this interaction. The signals concerning busulfan oral formulations and hepatic veno-oclusive disease risk in patients who have received prior radiation therapy /chemotherapy /HSCT, sterility, overdose treatment can be closed. These risks are assessed in the corresponding national procedures. The  MAH  of  Busilvex  has  responded  to  the  question  of  'Thrombotic  microangiopathy'  (TMA)  after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) requested as supplementary information. A cumulative review of the literature and safety database has been performed. The occurrence of TMA is multifactorial and busulfan IV by itself cannot be considered as a main factor in the development of this reaction. Mainly studies  from  literature  have  shown  that  high  busulfan i.v. doses  in  combination  with  other  drugs  in conditioning  treatment  previous  HCT  could  be  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  TMA.  As  a conclusion, busulfan could be one risk factor of development TMA and a warning is section 4.4 of the Busilvex SmPC is considered warranted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The warning for TMA after HCT only applies to one pharmaceutical form: the intravenous. Cases of TMA after high doses of busulfan i.v. in combination with other medicine as a conditioning treatment previous HCT have been seen after reviewing the literature and the cases retrieved in the safety database of the company. There are no cases with oral busulfan.

The benefit risk profile of the product remains favourable in the approved indications.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for busulfan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing busulfan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
