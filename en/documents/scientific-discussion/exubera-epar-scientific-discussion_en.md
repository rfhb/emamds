## 1. Introduction

Aventis/ Pfizer EEIG has applied for marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for the product EXUBERA, insulin inhalation powder.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Exubera  consists  of  two  components:  the  drug  product,  a  spray  dried  insulin  powder  in  unit  dose blisters and a pulmonary inhaler, a medical device. The  insulin  spray  dried  powder  contains  recombinant  human  insulin,  sodium  citrate,  sodium hydroxide, mannitol and glycine. The  intended  pulmonary  inhaler  is  a  reusable,  manually  operated,  pneumatically  powered,  dried powder delivery system for unit dose blisters containing insulin spray dried powder. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic illness characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that leads secondarily  to  long-term  microvascular  and  macrovascular  complications  such  as  neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, heart disease and renal failure. Insulin  therapy  is  an  absolute  requirement  for  the  treatment  of  type  1  DM  and  is  indicated  for  the treatment of type 2 DM when oral agents fail to provide adequate glycaemic control. Subcutaneously injected insulin has been used to treat (DM) since the 1920s. Although the long-term benefit of tight glycaemic control in patients with DM has been demonstrated in  the  DCCT  and  UKPDS  studies,  the  inconvenience  of  insulin  injection  therapy,  especially  a multiple-times daily regimen, represents a hurdle in achieving good glycaemic control. The  pulmonary  route  was  considered  because  the  alveoli  features  include  a  large  absorptive  area, adequate  permeability  to  macromolecules,  extensive  vascularisation,  minimal  mucociliary  clearance mechanisms and low chemical and enzymatic degradation (compared to the gastrointestinal system). Therefore, inhaled insulin is expected to allow a fast absorption of insulin resulting in rapid onset. INH  is  administered  before  each  meal  as  part  of  an  individualised  DM  control  regimen  that  may include other subcutaneous insulin formulations or oral hypoglycaemic agents. The drug substance is a recombinant human insulin (referred to as rhu-insulin).  Rhu-insulin has an amino acid sequence identical to endogenous human insulin, and is therefore not an insulin analogue. The drug product is produced with a newly developed spray drying process and pre-dispensed in 1mg and  3  mg  blisters.  The  bioavailability  of  Exubera  is  approximately  10%.  One  1mg  and  one  3  mg blisters  are  equivalent  to  approximately  3  IU  and  approximately  8  IU  subcutaneously  administered insulin. The applicant submitted a risk management plan in its marketing authorisation application. 2. Quality aspects Introduction

Insulin  (Human)  will  be  provided  as  insulin  spray-dried  powder,  comprised  of  recombinant  human insulin, sodium citrate, mannitol and glycine; and is presented in pre-dispensed 1 and 3 mg unit dose blisters.

For pulmonary drug delivery, a reusable manually operated dry powder inhaler is used. Key functions of  the  pulmonary  inhaler  are  the  dispersion  of  powder  to  form  an  aerosol  cloud  (inspiratory

Medicinal product no longer authorised General Information Generic Name(s) INN: Insulin Human Chemical Name Chemical Structure: Insulin human is a 51 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two polypeptide chains. The A and B chain, consisting of 21 and 30 amino acid residues, respectively, are linked by 2 disulfide bridges. The A chain contains one intra-chain disulfide bridge. Molecular Formula C257H383N65O77S6 Molecular Weight 5808 · Manufacture The  recombinant  humin  insulin  (HMR4006)  is  manufactured  from  a  fusion  protein  produced  by Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA technology. Development genetics The rationale for the construction of the vector/host system has been given and the preparation of the production strain ( E. coli ) has been sufficiently described. Cell bank For the production of HMR4006, starting from the production strain, a two tiered cell bank system of master and working cell banks was established.  The cell banks are tested for microbiological purity, identity, viability, plasmid retention and plasmid copy number.  In addition, the ability to express the fusion protein was verified on the basis of test fermentation runs.  The stability of the cell banks was confirmed  during  storage  and  fermentation.    The  results  of  these  studies  confirm  the  genetic  and physiological stability of the production strain. Description of the manufacturing process

The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and a flow chart has been provided. The process consists of 16 steps divided into three major parts: namely fermentation and harvesting  and downstream processing and final purification.

## Batch definition

Adequate information on batch definition and sub-batching is provided. A single ampoule is processed to  give  one  harvest  of  cells  with  fusion  protein.  For  the  subsequent  downstream  and  purification

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

process  the  batch  system  is  adequately  described;  in  defined  cases  due  to  the  capacity  of  the equipment of some stages sub-batches are produced.

## Fermentation

After inoculation with one ampoule of working seed, the bacteria of the production cells are cultivated in a three-step procedure.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Modification and Purification The inactivated cells are separated by centrifugation and disrupted by pressure-expansion treatment to obtain  the  fusion  protein  that  is  enriched  by  on-line  washing  and  centrifugation  steps.    The downstream  processing  of  the  fusion  protein  to  human  insulin  is  a  sequence  of  modification  and purification steps. Sub-batches are mixed to obtain the final drug substance and stored at -20 ° C ± 5 ° C. In-process controls The fermentation process, the downstream processing and purification of the expression product are sufficiently controlled by appropriate in-process controls and acceptance criteria. The efficiency of the concentration  and  purification  steps  is  monitored  by  HPLC  analysis.  The  structure  of  most  byproducts has been elucidated and their removal is either demonstrated by validation data and/or limits are set for in-process control testing at the respective purification stages. Development of the Manufacturing Process of the Active Substance During the early development phase of insulin inhalation powder, pre-dispensed, different recombinant  human  insulin  sources  deriving  from  modified  manufacturing  processes  were  used  for clinical (Phase 3) and development batches. Information demonstrating the equivalence between these sources  was  provided.  Scale  up  activities  at  different  stages  of  the  purification  process  and  the introduction of a new drying pocess were carried out to produce the required amount of HMR4006 insulin,  the  commercial  source  for  drug  product.  No  changes  occurred  in  fermentation  and  down stream  processing.  The  overview  of  differences  between  the  processes  for  the  different  sources  of human insulin is clearly and in sufficient detail presented . Process validation Adequate validation data were provided covering the complete drug substance manufacturing process. With the reported batches the acceptance limits for validation parameter and specifications for purity and  impurities,  respectively,  were  consistently  met.  The  submitted  data  confirm  that  the  applied procedures are adequately designed and controlled to yield a consistent quality of the drug substance. Detailed  justification  as  well  as  the  criteria  for  the  handling  of  non-conformity  intermediates  were given for reprocessing at defined manufacturing steps. Lifetime of column resins / column resin reuse The lifetime of the chromatography resins is validated ongoing by monitoring column performance on full-scale  production  equipment  over  the  course  of  commercial  production.  Data  presented  on  the monitoring of all columns of selected runs show no decrease in column performance. Characterisation Characterization studies were performed for the different recombinant insulin sources comparing each other. The complete study reports were provided showing that HMR 4006 was adequately characterised. In addition, analytical comparability between the different sources of insulin was demonstrated by Edman degradation, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and comparison of impurities profiles.

## Impurities

Impurities are extensively addressed. Full details on the potential impurities, the methods, in-process controls  and  batch  results  were  provided.  Removal  studies  were  included  as  part  of  the  process validation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Product related impurities were also addressed in detail as well as potential insulin related substances arising as the result of incomplete cleavage or cleavage at a non-desired site. These potential productrelated  impurities  are  removed  by  the  manufacturing  process  and  are  controlled  by  appropriate  inprocess controls and by the final drug substance specification. Release limits for total insulin related substances, and for A21-desamidoinsulin were set.

## · Specification

Medicinal product no longer authorised Appropriate specifications for the drug substance were set and justified. Full analytical methodology is provided including the validation of the test procedures and batch results. The specification for insulin human HMR4006 covers release and shelf-life limits. Batch  results  were  provided  for  9  batches  of  insulin  human  HMR4006.  All  batches  met  the specifications  and  showed  consistency.  The  choice  of  test  parameters  and  acceptance  criteria  are justified  by  these  batch  data.  Analytical  methods  for  assay,  purity,  microbiological  and  biological properties are described in sufficient detail and were validated in accordance with ICH standards. · Reference Standards The  choice  and  control  of  the  reference  substance  are  considered  acceptable.  The  procedure  for qualification of secondary reference standards was described. The certificate of analysis of the current secondary standard was submitted. Calibration against the Ph.Eur. CRS was performed. · Container Closure System Insulin drug substance is packaged into stainless steel lidded drums for storage and transport to the drug  product  manufacturing  facility.    The  containers  are  specific  to  HMR4006.  Specifications  and quality control documentation are submitted. The container closure system is considered acceptable. · Stability The applicant provided real time stability data for the storage of the drug substance at -20 ± 5 ° C. Data from three production scale batches of human insulin stored in glass ampoules (60 months) and from three  production  scale batches  of  human  insulin  HMR4006 stored in steel drums (24 months) were submitted. In addition data were provided from which it can be concluded that the stability behaviour of the drug substance is similar in glass ampoules and steel drums. Real time data for HMR4006 covering 24 months stored both in stainless steel and in glass ampoules are well within the shelf life specifications and no significant changes in product stability are observed after 24 months. A shelf  life  for  the  drug  substance  HMR4006  of  48  months  under  the  recommended  conditions  of -20 ° C ± 5 ° can be granted under the condition that the applicant committed to submit the 36 months and 48 months stability data for drug substance HMR4006 in steel drums (and in glass ampoules) at -20 ± 5°C on an ongoing basis. Drug Product · Pharmaceutical Development

## Introduction

The applicant performed an extensive pharmaceutical development program.

A dry powder insulin formulation was developed in view of the physicochemical stability of insulin and to allow storage at room temperature. A novel spray drying process was developed to produce primary  particle  size  distributions  in  the  desired  range  for  delivery  to  the  deep  lung  (mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aerodynamic particle diameters ~3µm). The spray-dried powder is filled into unit dose blisters. The blister  provides  the  means  to  insert  insulin  inhalation  powder  into  the  pulmonary  inhaler  for aerosolisation before dosing.

Key functions of the pulmonary inhaler are the dispersion of powder to form an aerosol cloud that contains drug particles for alveolar deposition in a holding chamber and the delivery of the aerosolised powder  to  the  patient.  Patient  inspiratory  effort  is  independent  from  the  generation  process  of  the aerosolised cloud.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Summary of Pharmaceutical Development (selected points) During the development and clinical trials, different insulin sources, pulmonary inhalers and different drug product formulations were used. Excipients Selection  criteria  for  excipients  were  suitability  (safety)  for  inhalation  use,  acceptable  long-term stability, aerosol delivery performance with the pulmonary inhaler and appropriate aqueous solubility to facilitate rapid absorption. Mannitol was chosen as stabilising/bulking agent, glycine as buffering agent and sodium citrate as buffering/stabilising agent. Drug substance The drug substance used came from two suppliers. In the development, toxicology studies, and Phase I, IIa and IIb trials the earlier insulin supplier was used while the later supplier was used for pivotal Phase III and stability studies. To demonstrate comparability of the insulins from the two suppliers, a series of characterisation analyses were performed on the insulin drug substance and the corresponding spray dried powders. Comparability of the insulin spray dried powders manufactured from drug substance of both suppliers was demonstrated. Developmental stability studies Developmental  stability  studies  showed  that  moisture  content  is  a  critical  parameter  impacting chemical stability. Measures were implemented, including blister design and development, to maintain the  product  moisture  content  and  minimize  moisture  uptake.  In  addition,  moisture  protection  was optimized during the product shelf life, and protective secondary packaging, consisting of a sealed foil laminate overwrap and desiccant, was developed. Aerosol Product Performance Key aerosol  performance  attributes  of  the  powder-filled  blister,  when  actuated  with  the  pulmonary inhaler, include aerodynamic particle size distribution (PSD), fine particle dose (FPD) and to a lesser extent total emitted dose (ED).  Among these aerosol metrics, FPD was found to be most predictive of systemic exposure, although a precise quantitative correlation could not be concluded. Lack of dose equivalence between 1 mg and 3 mg blister strengths Subsequent  to  the  initiation  of  the  Phase  3  clinical  trial  program  a  confirmatory  dose  equivalence study with the 60% insulin formulation was conducted, demonstrating that the two strengths are not dose-equivalent: Three 1 mg blisters are not bioequivalent to one 3 mg blister. In conclusion, 1 mg and 3mg  blisters  are  not  interchangeable.  AUC  and  Cmax  values  of  3x1  mg  inhaled  insulin  are approximately  40%  and  30%  greater,  respectively,  than  1x3  mg  inhaled  insulin.  This  finding  is qualitatively supported by in - vitro data for the FPD. The FPD of 3x1mg blister is 20% higher than the  FPD  for  1x3  mg  blister.    The  applicant  explained  that  the  performance  difference  was  fully characterised, and shown to be inherent in the drug product system.

The lack of dose equivalence between the two proposed blister strengths was considered as a major concern  during  the  review  of  the  application.  It  was  extensively  discussed  under  pharmaceutical aspects and concerning its clinical implications, as patients cannot rely on the same efficacy of both dose strengths when the same nominal amount of drug substance is administered. In clinical trials dose titration and approximal dose proportionality over the range of 1mg to 6 mg were achievable with both strengths. No safety and efficacy concerns arose from the lack of interchangeability of both blisters in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these  trials.  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  the  lack  of  dose  equivalence  between  the  two  blister strengths could sufficiently be addressed by a clear and strong warning in the SPC/ PIL and on the outer package and on the foil overwrap.

## Clinical product performance

In  clinical  product  performance studies, the sensitivity of the aerosol performance to environmental humidity conditions during use was discovered. In insulin release unit (IRU) use-life studies a linear relationship between emitted dose and humidity was evident. The emitted dose varied not more than 10% over 14 days of continuous exposure to relative humidities up to 65%, supporting a two-week replacement interval for the IRU.

Medicinal product no longer authorised This issue is sufficiently addressed by instructions for use included in the SPC and the PIL concerning inadvertent  exposure  to  high  environmental  humidity.  The  risk  of  patient  non-compliance  with  the replacement  interval  of  14  days  for  the  insulin  release  unit,  is  minimized  by  the  increase  of  the package sizes for the insulin release unit (6-unit package plus one spare unit) and proposed reminder stickers on the IRU folding carton. Bioequivalence Particle  size  distribution  between  clinical-scale  and  commercial-scale  insulin  dried  powder  is  not identical,  which  is  in  line  with  the  observed  differences  in  aerodynamic  particle  size  distribution between  clinical-scale  and  commercial-scale  batches  of  drug  product.  Therefore,  bioequivalence studies were performed to show comparability of clinical-scale and commercial-scale batches. Product performance During  evaluation  of  product  performance,  information  on  product  behaviour  (blister  +  pulmonary inhaler) emerged that led to several inhaler instructions for use. · Manufacture of the Drug Product Manufacturers Information on the different manufacturing sites and their responsibilities was provided. Batch Formula The batch size and batch formula for the production of commercial scale batches of the drug product were defined. Description of the Manufacturing Process The manufacturing process of the drug product consists of three steps: (1) The solution preparation and (2) the spray drying process for the manufacture of the insulin spray dried powder and 3) filling and packaging. Insulin spray dried powder is an intermediate in the manufacturing process of the drug product. The powder is stored in steel containers and shipped to the blister-filling site, where it is filled in 1mg and 3mg blisters. Descriptions of the commercial scale solution preparation, spray drying process and the filling process were provided along with flowcharts including in - process controls. The target spray dryer parameters were  based  on  development  and  scale-up  studies.  Adequate  in-process  controls  with  suitable acceptance criteria were set. Critical steps were identified and are sufficiently controlled. Analytical methods were described and validated where appropriate. Control of intermediates

Insulin spray dried powder is considered as intermediate in the manufacture of the drug product. The selected tests and acceptance criteria for the spray dried powder are adequate to routinely determine identity, purity and content of insulin. The analytical methods were described. Acceptance criteria for the intermediate were set and sufficiently justified.

All proposed acceptance criteria are supported by results of 168 batches of intermediate product.

## Process validation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from several qualification batches were submitted. Qualification lots were produced under GMP conditions. These data demonstrate the validity of the manufacturing process.

## Control of excipients

Mannitol, glycine, sodium citrate (dihydrate), sodium hydroxide and water for injections used in the manufacture of insulin inhalation powder, pre-dispensed meet their respective monographs. Ph.  Eur.  Certifications  from  suppliers  were  provided.  All  excipients  have  been  certified  as  not  of human or animal origin.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Since  Exubera  is  an  inhalation  product,  additional  tests  for  microbiological  evaluation  and  stricter acceptance criteria for microbiological tests were implemented in the control of excipients. · Product Specification Regarding the choice of test procedures the applicant employed methods or criteria for human insulin and injectable insulin preparations published in the Ph. Eur. and other tests, which are specific for this entirely new product. The methods for release testing of the drug product were sufficiently described and validated following ICH guidelines. Release  and  end  of  shelf  -  life  specifications  were  submitted  for  the  1-mg  and  3-mg  packaged strengths. The acceptance criteria were sufficiently justified based on relevant clinical batch results. The acceptance criteria for the aerosol performance parameter were tightened based on batch release results  from  batches  used  in  phase  3  (pivotal)  Type  1  diabetes  clinical  trials,  stability  data  from batches  used  in  Type  1  diabetes  clinical  trials  and  data  from  production  scale  batches.  However, further  reconsidering  based  on  commercial  production  experience  is  expected  as  a  follow  up  measure. The release and end of shelf life specifications were revised with regard to impurities. Two of them should be further reconsidered as follow-up measure. · Batch analysis data Batch release data were presented from a total of over 150 batches; over 15 were production scale batches. · Characterisation of impurities Potential impurities deriving from  the human  insulin  recombinant  process,  the  drug  product manufacturing process or originating from the degradation of insulin and insulin inhalation powder were  characterised  and  are  qdequately  controlled  by  the  introduction  of  acceptance  criteria  in  the release and end of shelf life specifications. · Reference standards or materials Sufficient information on the chemical reference standards or reference materials for human insulin was provided. Control  inhalers  and  insulin  release  unit  assemblies  to  test  the  drug  product  meet  commercial specifications. They were also used for the testing of clinical batches.

## · Container closure system

Insulin inhalation powder, pre-dispensed utilizes two container closure systems: a container system for transport and further processing of the insulin spray dried powder into unit dose blisters and a unit

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose  blister  system.    The  primary  packaging  materials  from  these  container  closure  systems  was sufficiently described. Primary packaging material is either tested according to Ph.Eur. or certified by the supplier in compliance with relevant EU and US requirements.

SPC.

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The information provided in the application showed a consistent batch-tobatch production of Exubera achieving an acceptable quality for the drug substance and drug product. The  fermentation,  basic  down-stream  processing  and  purification  of  the  drug  substance,  human recombinant insulin, are adequately controlled and validated. Appropriate drug substance specifications are set. The drug substance was well-characterized using state-of the-art methods with regard  to  its  physicochemical  characteristics.  During  the  extensive  pharmaceutical  development program the lack of dosage form equivalence between the 1mg and 3mg blister strengths was revealed

Medicinal product no longer authorised The stability data support the proposed shelf life of 12 months for the insulin spray dried powder. Finished Product In general, stability data support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. According  to  the  ICH  Guideline,  stability  data  over  36  months  from  clinical-scale  batches  of  both strengths were provided to support the proposed shelf life of 2 years. Additionally, 6-months stability data  stored  at  25°C/75% RH  after  removal  of  the  protective  foil  pouch  showed  acceptable  quality through the proposed additional 3-month 'in-use period'. Because  of  the  changed  spray  drying  process  during  scale-up,  the  investigated  batches  are  not considered to be fully representative of the commercial manufacturing process. A stability program for commercial scale material has been started; an interim stability report was provided consistent with release testing and ICH stability testing results. A commitment has been given to finish the stability program on an ongoing basis according to the provided stability protocols. · Facilities and Equipment Flow  charts  of  the  manufacturing  process  were  provided  together  with  appropriate  details  of  the equipment and facilities. · Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the product manufacture and therefore there is no risk of contamination with viral or TSE agents by these ingredients. No animal ingredients are used for the  preparation  of  the  cell  banks  or  in  the  fermentation  process.  During  down  stream  processing, trypsin and carboxypeptidase B are used, which are derived from porcine pancreas. Viral validation studies  were  carried  out  demonstrating  that  the  possibility  of  viral  contamination  with  the  use  of porcine enzymes in the production process is considered negligible. · Medical Device The pulmonary inhaler and associated accessories (insulin release unit assembly and chamber) are the subjects of the Nektar Therapeutics and Pfizer technical files. EC certificates were awarded for both technical files. The stability of base/ chamber and insulin release unit was demonstrated to be 2 years. The proposed use life of 1 year for the base and chamber and the use life of 14 days for the insulin release unit is supported by the clinical experience program. Since environmental moisture from 65% RH has been identified to be a critical parameter during use additional instructions are included in the Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

which has been addressed taking its clinical implications into account (see clinical part of this report). The manufacturing process of the drug product was described and validated in sufficient detail. The quality of the drug product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. No excipients of human  or  animal  origin  are  used  in  the  product  manufacture  and  therefore  there  is  no  risk  of contamination with viral or TSE agents by these ingredients. No animal ingredients are used for the cell culture process, the basic down stream processing and purification with the exception of porcine trypsin  and  porcine  carboxypeptidase  B.  Sufficient  virus  validation  data  were  provided  for  the manufacturing  processes  of  both  porcine  enzymes  and,  as  well,  for  the  manufacturing  process  of recombinant human insulin to consider that Exubera is virologically safe. The applicant will address a number of quality points as follow-up measures post opinion.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics, Safety pharmacology, Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Medicinal product no longer authorised 3. Non-clinical aspects Introduction Exubera is an insulin formulation suitable for administration with a pulmonary delivery device.  The drug substance is a recombinant human insulin. Two inhalation powder formulations, each containing one of two marketed insulin preparations for subcutaneous injection, were used in both the nonclinical and clinical development programs. Due  to  the  fact  that  the  systemic  safety  profile  of  marketed  recombinant  human  insulin  is  well described  both  non-clinically  and  clinically,  the  respiratory  system  was  the  primary  focus  of  the toxicology studies for the insulin inhalation powder, and the excipient powder (mannitol, glycine and sodium citrate excipients). All pivotal toxicological studies were stated to be carried out according to GLP Principles. Toxicology data from an earlier supplier and Aventis rhu-insulins administered subcutaneously were also used to support the inhalation program. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo ) The  pharmacology  of  recombinant  human  insulin  is  well  known.  A  set  of  pharmacology  studies, which  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of  inhaling  various  dry  powder  insulin  formulations  in  rats, monkeys and dogs, was submitted. Different insulin strengths and excipients were employed in the pulmonary dosing formulations, and, with  the  exception  of  the  dog  study,  they  varied  from  the  current  clinical  formulation  (I-016).  In addition, the methods of lung exposure to insulin powder in the nonclinical studies were different from those  employed  in  clinical  studies,  in  which  inhalation  from  a  pulmonary  delivery  system  was employed.  Nevertheless, like in humans, insulin inhalation powder administered by the pulmonary route to rats, monkeys and dogs, was absorbed into the bloodstream in a dose-dependent manner and produced the expected pharmacodynamic response of decreasing glucose concentrations.

A cardiovascular study was conducted in anaesthetised dogs where the rhu-insulin used in the current formulation was compared with a corresponding marketed rhu-insulin, Humulin, following intravenous injection. Both formulations produced a slight increase in heart contractility and heart rate, a well-known effect of human insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  specific  secondary  pharmacology,  additional  safety  pharmacology  or  pharmacodynamic  drug interaction studies were conducted and, in consideration of the nature of recombinant human insulin to the endogenous hormone, comparable pharmacology would be expected.

## Pharmacokinetics

Medicinal product no longer authorised No definitive  nonclinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted.  Nonclinical  pharmacokinetics  in rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  was  determined  in  several  pharmacology  studies  and  in  2  pilot  nonclinical safety  studies  using  non-validated  radioimmuno-assays.  In the nonclinical studies, different insulin concentrations and excipients were employed in the pulmonary dosing formulations.  The method of formulation delivery was a pulmonary delivery system, which is different than the method of delivery in humans. · Absorption- Bioavailability The apparent systemic bioavailability is relatively low and variable. Inter-animal variability appears to be even higher than in clinical studies at least in part due to the difficulty in delivering precise doses of insulin to the airways. In the preclinical studies conducted, the range of bioavailability relative to a subcutaneous dose ranged from 10% to 93%. The range of bioavailability observed was due to the differences in doses administered across the studies and methods by which the pulmonary dose was determined. However, independent of the species, formulation and route of administration, the time of the observed maximal systemic concentrations of insulin was generally right after the administration of dose, suggesting that insulin was rapidly absorbed from the lung. The mechanism of insulin absorption is described in the scientific literature; it is believed to occur via paracellular  transport,  which  primarily  involves  passive  diffusion  of  insulin  across  the  alveolar epithelium through extracellular tight junctions. · Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion No pharmacokinetic studies on distribution, metabolism or excretion were performed on account of the identity of recombinant human insulin to the endogenous hormone. In the inhalation toxicology studies in rats and monkeys for up to 6-months there was no evidence for an accumulation of particles in the lung. An assessment of the respiratory tract deposition and clearance of insulin inhalation powder was also based on literature. Prior to deposition in the deep lung following inhalation, there are several sites at which insulin inhalation powder is eliminated, including residual retention in the blister/device, and deposition in the oropharynx and conducting airways. Once deposited in alveolar spaces, a portion of the inhaled bolus is absorbed into systemic circulation, while the remaining material is likely removed by a combination of mechanisms, including mucociliary clearance, phagocytosis and destruction by alveolar macrophages,  insulin-specific and non-specific enzymatic  degradation,  and  lymphatic drainage.

Also, regarding the excipients in Exubera, mannitol, glycine and sodium citrate, there are no data on their clearance on long-term administration. From literature there is no indication for an accumulation in  the  lung.  Mannitol,  as  a  relatively  small  molecule,  is  presumed  to  clear  rapidly  from  airspaces. Available literature data suggest that clearance half-times for mannitol delivered to respiratory tract via inhalation may be of the order of approximately one hour. Glycine is a naturally occurring amino acid,  with  relatively  low  molecular  weight  and  is  present  in  biological  fluids.  The  relatively  small amounts of glycine delivered in insulin inhalation powder are not judged likely to accumulate in the lung. Sodium citrate is also a naturally occurring substance and present in biological fluids. Sodium citrate and citric acid are inactive ingredients contained in an approved suspension for inhalation.

Toxicology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  toxicology  program  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of  insulin  inhalation  powder  and excipients to the respiratory tract.  The program consisted of pivotal 1- and 6-month inhalation studies in the rat and monkey using the earlier supplier of rhu-insulin.  A pivotal 1-month rat inhalation study was done with Aventis rhu-insulin to confirm the toxicological equivalence of the two formulations. In addition, lung cell proliferation indices and anti-insulin antibody titers were measured.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  single  dose  inhalation  studies  in  rat  and  monkey  were  exploratory  studies  mainly  to  validate inhalation  exposure  system,  define  an  upper  limit  of  insulin  powder  exposure  and  estimate  the bioavailability of inhaled insulin relative to SC injection. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) The main characteristics of the pivotal repeated-dose toxicity studies (Inhalation) are given in the table below. The high doses were defined in exploratory studies and are at the same time the MTDs that induce hypoglycaemia. The high doses for rat and monkey were approximately 40x and 4x the human clinical starting dose based on mg/kg/day. The pivotal studies have been conducted at an experienced inhalation contract laboratory (nose-only system for rats; individual head domes for monkeys). The exposures were well controlled and doses were approximately as targeted. The particle sizes were appropriate for the species used and allowed for exposure of the entire respiratory tract. A  dose-dependent  systemic  exposure  to  insulin  was  confirmed  by  increased  insulin  and  decreased glucose concentrations.

From  the  standard  toxicology  endpoints  (mortality,  body  weights,  clinical  observations,  clinical pathology,  ECG  in  monkeys)  no  special  hazard  was  identified;  the  studies  showed  the  expected hypoglycaemia responses from the exaggerated insulin doses. There was no mortality in monkeys. In rats  a  few  deaths  from  hypoglycaemia  (medium  and  high  doses)  and  a  few  other  deaths  from incidental  causes  occurred.  There  were  neither  body  weight  or  opthalmological  changes,  nor  ECG effects in monkeys.

Anti-insulin  antibodies  were  evaluated  in  serum  from  rats  and  monkeys  or  in  lavage  fluid  from monkeys. There was no antibody response in monkeys and a weak antibody response in rats, which is consistent with subcutaneous data and literature data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pulmonary  function  assessments  have  been  conducted  on  anaesthetised,  spontaneously  breathing animals. There were no exposure related effects on respiratory rate, tidal and minute volumes, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, resistance and compliance.

Following section there were no gross findings.  Occasional  significant  differences  from  control  for several  organ  weights,  including  the  lung,  have  been  seen.  There  was  a  trend  to  slightly  increased absolute lung weights, mainly in females. However, the effect was neither dose-related nor durationrelated.

It  is  generally  accepted  that  insulin  acts  through  the  insulin  receptor  (IR)  to  initiate  its  metabolic signalling pathway while insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) acts through the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) to initiate a mitogenic signalling pathway.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The histopathological evaluation of the respiratory tract was done by standard hematoxylin and eosin staining on nasal turbinates, larynx, trachea and lungs with bronchi and bronchial lymph nodes. The most  frequently  observed  changes  in  the  lungs  of  rats  were  random,  focal  infiltrates  of  either interstitial  mononuclear  cells  or  clusters  of  inflammatory  cells  within  alveolar  spaces  and,  focal  or multifocal  aggregates  of  alveolar  histiocytes  within  alveolar  spaces  in  monkeys.  The  findings  were morphologically similar, minimal to mild in severity and were observed in all dose groups, including air and excipients controls. There was no evidence of permanent anatomic or physiological changes. · Genotoxicity There is no evidence of a genotoxic effect of rhu-insulin. Rhu-insulin  in  Exubera  is  a  biotechnologically  produced  homologue  of  human  insulin.  Therefore genetic toxicology testing is not required (according to Guideline ICH S6). Nevertheless, some tests (e.g. AMES test) were performed with either Aventis rhu-insulin or rhu-insulin Humulin ; these tests were negative. · Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been performed, mainly based on the following arguments: -According to ICH S6 guidelines on the Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals, standard carcinogenicity bioassays are generally inappropriate for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. -No  insulin  or  excipient  powder-related  histopathological  changes  were  observed  in  the respiratory tract of rats and monkeys in the 1- or 6-month inhalation toxicology studies. -A  previous  supplier  and  Aventis  rhu-insulins  are  identical  in  amino  acid  sequence  to  the endogenous human hormone, and thus are not insulin analogues. -There is no evidence for a genotoxic effect. -There  is  no  epidemiological  evidence  that  injected  animal  or  rhu-insulin  is  associated  with tumour formation in humans at either local or distal sites based on approximately 80 years of clinical experience. Cell proliferation studies:

The cellular proliferation indices in formalin-fixed lung tissue from the 6-month inhalation studies in rats  and  monkeys  via  the  PCNA  and  Ki-67  immunhistochemistry  procedures  were  determined retrospectively.  The  examined  tissue  samples  consisted  of  alveolar  and  bronchiolar  epithelium,  the most relevant anatomic location in the lung for tumorgenesis. There were no statistically significant differences  in  proliferation  indices  for  air  control,  excipient  control,  or  high  dose  insulin  inhalation

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

powder groups either in rats or monkeys.  However, in the rat the mean proliferation indices in the high dose insulin groups were approximately 2 fold compared to the mean proliferation indices in the air  control  or  excipients  control  groups.  Since  a  doubling  of  the  proliferation  index  could  be  of biological  relevance,  the  applicant  has  been  requested  to  provide  additional  data  on  carcinogenic potential

In conclusion, non-clinical data on insulin inhalation powder did not show a tumorigenic risk for the lung relevant to human therapeutic use.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Reproductive and developmental studies No studies  on  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  have  been  conducted  with  Exubera.  Taking into account the data existing on human insulin given subcutaneously, the omission of such studies performed via the inhalatory route of administration can be accepted. Administration  of  insulins  at  high  doses  to  non-diabetic  animals  during  pregnancy  caused  a teratogenic response. However, it is unlikely that insulin has direct teratogenic effects. Rhu-insulin, insulin from other mammals, and oral antidiabetic agents are known to induce in experimental animals birth defects probably secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. From epidemiological data in diabetic women treated with human insulin, it is well known that the increased mortality and morbidity of their offspring can be significantly reduced by careful control of the maternal glucose level. The  anti-insulin  antibody  response  observed  after  Exubera  treatment  was  questioned  as  a  potential hazard  for  the  foetus.  Although  insulin  does  not  cross  the  placenta,  theoretically  insulin-specific antibodies may cross the placenta alone or in complex with insulin leading to metabolic aberrations in the foetus. Based on the literature submitted, no association between increased insulin antibody levels and major neonatal morbidities in pregnancies with good glycaemic control was suggested, although an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia could not be fully excluded. Results from clinical studies did not indicate that insulin antibodies associated with Exubera treatment affect dosing of either shortacting  or  basal  insulin,  fasting  plasma  glucose  levels,  or  the  incidence  or  timing  of  hypoglycaemic events. Although based on these findings, the increase in insulin antibodies was considered to be a low risk, a hypothetical risk for prenatal development cannot be excluded. The applicant has committed to monitor  antibody  levels  in  ongoing  clinical  trials  to  increase  understanding  of  insulin  antibody production and define its potential consequences. Furthermore,  in  the  \"Comparative  Discontinuation  Phase  of  Study  111\"  it  was  shown  that  among subjects with type 1 DM, mean insulin antibody level fell by approximately 50% within the initial 3 months after inhaled insulin discontinuation. Among subjects with type 2 DM, mean insulin antibody level also fell after discontinuation, but the decline was slightly less and more protracted than in type 1 patients. When an Exubera treated patient becomes pregnant, appropriate subcutaneous insulin should be  substituted  for  Exubera.  Therefore,  maternal  IAB  levels  are  expected  to  be  much  lower  when maternofetal IgG transfer begins early in the second trimester.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a consequence, the following is stated in the SPC:

'There is no clinical experience with Exubera use in pregnancy. Exubera frequently induces insulin antibodies, the risk of which to the foetus is not known. Therefore, Exubera should not be used during pregnancy.  When  an  Exubera  treated  patient  becomes  pregnant,  appropriate  subcutaneous  insulin should be substituted for Exubera.'

## · Local tolerance

The  potential  for  insulin  to  act  as  a  growth  promoter  in  humans  who  might  have  pre-existing, undetected  tumors  or  pre-neoplastic  changes  in  the  lung,  was  also  questioned.  In  response  the applicant  provided  data  regarding  characterization  of  growth  factors  and  their  receptors  in  normal tissue  and  human  tumor  tissues,  a  discussion  on  growth  factor/growth  factor  receptors  in  various tumor-derived cultured cell models that are used as model systems for human lung tumors and for in vitro mitogenicity assays, as well as literature data.

Medicinal product no longer authorised No specific local tolerance studies were done in support of the inhalation program.  However, local tolerance was assessed for the respiratory system in repeat dose 1- and 6-month inhalation studies. No adverse effects related to local tolerance were observed. · Other toxicity studies Excipients The safety of the excipients has been demonstrated in the inhalation toxicology studies in rats at levels of up to approximately 100-300 times the human level and in monkeys of up to approximately 10-30 times  the  human  level.  The  safety  is  also  supported  by  a  literature  review  on  the  respiratory  tract deposition and clearance of insulin inhalation dry powder. The excipients are therefore considered safe for the intended use. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Considering the nature of the insulin inhalation powder, its degradation to amino acids, the very low amount of urinary excretion, its potential for biodegradation and hydrolysis during and after sewage treatment plant, as well as inactivation after oral uptake, Exubera is of low environmental risk. Discussion on the non-clinical aspects Pharmacology studies showed that insulin inhalation powder administered by pulmonary route to rats, monkeys and dogs, was absorbed into the bloodstream in a dose-dependent manner and produced the expected pharmacodynamic response of decreasing glucose concentrations. No definitive nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. The apparent systemic bioavailability was relatively low and variable. According to limited non-clinical study and the applicant's literature review, chronic administration of Exubera is not likely to result in accumulation in the lung. Due to insulin's affinity for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors, the tumorigenic risk for the lung was  questioned. The  applicant provided estimation of local insulin concentrations and information on IGF-1 receptors and insulin receptors in lung. Based on these data and considering that Aventis recombinant human insulin has a low affinity for IGF-1 receptors (compared to IGF-1 itself), it  is  concluded  that  insulin  inhalation  powder  is  unlikely  to  stimulate  mitogenesis  via  the  IGF-1 receptor.

In conclusion, non-clinical data on insulin inhalation powder did not show a tumorigenic risk for the lung  nor  suggest  that insulin  inhalation  powder  may  promote  pre-existing  preneoplastic/neoplastic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changes in the lung. Further non-clinical experimentation would be of limited relevance for human risk assessment. See also clinical safety section.

The potential hazard for the foetus of the frequently induced insulin antibody is unknown therefore Exubera should not be used during pregnancy.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 4. Clinical aspects Introduction Exubera consists of a dry powder formulation of regular insulin (in unit dose blisters) to be inhaled through a manually operated, pneumatically powered delivery system. The product was designed to optimise alveolar deposition of powder while minimizing deposition in upper airways through the use of a holding chamber that encourages a slow deep inspiration of an aerosol cloud that contains drug particles. Four different insulin spray dried powder formulations which contained different amounts of insulin and excipients were used in the development and clinical program. The active substance used came from two suppliers. The drug substance supplied by the earlier supplier was used for development, toxicology studies, and Phase I, IIa and IIb trials. Commercial source of insulin was used for pivotal Phase III and stability studies. The  proposed  commercial  inhaler  and  its  constituents  were  used  in  the  Phase  3  clinical  trials  and further modified considering clinical experiences. The clinical development program is extensive and consists of 32 single-dose pharmacological studies, 1 multi-dose (6-month) exploratory clinical pharmacology study (study 1026) and more than 20 Phase 2/3 studies. Eight controlled Phase 3 studies (106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 1001, 1002 and 1009), and three controlled supportive  Phase  2  studies  (102,  103,  104)  had  been  completed  at  the  time  of  the  marketing authorisation application and represent the core of the INH Phase 2/3 clinical development program. During  the  procedure,  results  on  additional  comparative  phase  3  studies  (1022,  1027,  1029, preliminary results on studies 1028 and 1030) were submitted. Overall,  821  subjects  were  exposed  to  INH  during  the  32  single-dose  pharmacological  studies  and more than 1975 patients have received INH for more than 6 months. Because there are insufficient long-term safety data in children, the applicant did not seek a paediatric indication at the present time. Its use is therefore not recommended in patients under 18 years of age. The applicant stated that all clinical studies conformed to ICH good clinical practice standards and were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Pharmacokinetics

The Applicant has conducted a comprehensive clinical pharmacology program including 32 singledose studies and one 6-month chronic-dose study. These studies were conducted in healthy volunteers, in  patients  with  type  1  or  type  2  DM  or  in  special  populations  such  as  children,  elderly,  obese, smokers and subjects with underlying lung disease (asthma, COPD).

Seventeen of the 32 pharmacological studies were conducted during early development stage and used early  powder  formulations  and  inhaler  versions.  Most  of  these  early  studies  were  performed  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicinal product no longer authorised Comparability of the clinical (phase 3) and commercial formulation of INH  was  formally demonstrated for the 3 mg blister. Although equivalence could not formally be demonstrated for the 1 mg blister, the deviation from the lower limit of the pre-defined acceptance range was minimal and considered clinically not relevant. · Absorption Following oral inhalation of a single dose of human insulin approximately 60% of the emitted dose (about 40% of the blister content) reaches the lung while 30% is deposited in the oropharynx and 10% in  the  conducting  airways.  Insulin  is  a  peptide  drug  with  negligible  gastrointestinal  absorption. Consequently, the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx or swallowed is not expected to affect blood PK profiles. Inhaled human insulin is absorbed as rapidly as the ultrarapid acting insulin analogue lispro and more rapidly  than  SC  soluble  human  insulin  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  subjects  with  type  1  or  type  2 diabetes. The time to peak insulin concentration (Tmax) is about 45 min and is generally half of that for SC soluble human insulin. Peak insulin concentration (Cmax) and total exposure (AUC) of INH are generally comparable to those of SC soluble human insulin. At 400 min post-INH dose, insulin levels returned close to baseline. Bioavailability In diabetic subjects, the bioavailability of INH relative to SC regular insulin ranged from 8% to 11% (mean about 10%). Particle size was shown to significantly influence the bioavailability of INH. The optimal diameter for pulmonary penetration is 2 to 3 µm, and, the degree of monodispersion of the aerosol is critical to avoid impaction in larger airways and the oropharynx. The final inhaler device delivers particles with a  mean mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) that approximate the optimal diameter for pulmonary penetration outlined above. The effect of the inhalation procedure/manoeuvres on bioavailability of INH was studied with early INH formulations and inhaler. Slow deep inspiration of INH with a subsequent 5 to 7 seconds breath hold appears to provide highest bioavailability although failure to hold breath did not have a major effect.  Based  upon  modeled  inhaled  particle  deposition  predictions,  certain  conclusions  about  the effect of peak inspiratory flow rate from the early studies using earlier INH formulation and inhaler types are expected to also apply to the final formulation and inhaler. A consistent and standard inhalation procedure is important to ensure both optimal and consistent drug delivery. Detailed guidance for the inhalation procedure was successfully provided to the patients in the Phase 3 clinical program. Similar guidance should be given in both the SPC and in the PL.

In  case  of  major  changes  to  the  inhalation  procedure,  an  accidental  'increase'  in  inhalation  rate (though  unexpected  due  to  the  nature  of  the  device  and  its  associated  cloud  chamber),  would potentially  result  in  a  lower  exposure  to  insulin  and  therefore  should  not  be  associated  with  an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The impact of the opposite case of an accidental and unusually low inhalation rate is considered low for particles of ~3-µm diameter.

In conclusion, patients to be treated with EXUBERA must receive comprehensive instructions in the use  of  the  inhaler,  and  must  know  that  a  consistent  and  standard  inhalation  technique  should  be characterise  and  optimise  the  INH  system  and  to  identify  variables  that  may  have  an  effect  on  the performance of the product and thus direct transferability of the results to the final formulation was not intended. A number of these studies investigated important issues such as INH deposition, effect of particle size, changes in breathing maneuver, and effect of mild asthma on bioavailability of INH. The combination of the final inhaler version and the clinical trial formulation produced slightly higher total  exposure  and  peak  serum  insulin  concentrations  than  the  combination  of  earlier  inhaler  and powder formulation. Therefore, results from early studies are only of limited applicability to the final formulation.  However,  it  can  be  expected  that  some  main  conclusions  still  apply,  e.g.  that  lack  of breath hold after inhalation does not have a major effect on exposure or that exposure may decrease with increasing airway resistance (asthma).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

employed to ensure optimal and consistent drug delivery. Adequate wording detailing the appropriate inhalation  procedure  in  conjunction  with  a  precautionary  statement  on  the  potential  to  alter  insulin exposure in case of major deviations should be included in the SPC and PL.

## · Distribution and elimination

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  metabolism  of  human  insulin  is  well  known.  Human  insulin  circulates  in  blood  as  the  free monomer  with  a  volume  of  distribution  that  approximates  the  volume  of  extracellular  fluid.  The degradation of insulin by peripheral tissues, including lung, is well established. The metabolites are inactive.  Thus,  no  investigations  on  distribution  and  elimination  of  INH  or  in  subpopulations  with renal or hepatic impairment were performed and no such investigations are required. In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, insulin requirements may be reduced. · Dose proportionality and dose equivalence Dose  proportionality  of  INH  has  been  assessed  in  a  number  of  studies.  Although  mean  insulin exposure (AUC) and Cmax increased approximately linearly with INH doses from 1 to 6 mg (using both 1 and 3 mg blister strengths), dose proportionality could not formally be established in any of these  studies.  The  lack  of  dose  proportionality  is  not  surprising  given  the  fact  that  the  1  and  3  mg blisters are not dose equivalent. A dose-equivalence study in healthy volunteers has shown that three 1-mg blisters are not equivalent to  one  3-mg  blister;  consecutive  inhalations  of  three  1  mg  blisters  resulted  in  approximately  40% higher exposure than inhalation of one 3 mg blister. See discussion on clinical efficacy. · Variability Since  insulin  is  titrated  individually,  the  intra-subject  variability  rather  than  the  between-subject variability is the primary concern because high within-variability could increase the risk for impaired glycaemic control and/or hypoglycaemia. In patients with type 1 DM, the within-subject variability in AUC was similar for INH (clinical formulation) and SC regular insulin, but the variability in Cmax was greater for INH. In subjects with type 2 DM, the within-subject variability of PK parameters was similar or lower for INH than SC regular insulin. In multiple-period, single dose studies, an apparent trend toward a lower variability in later treatment periods was observed for both the INH AUC and Cmax values consistent with increased familiarity with the inhalation procedure. Therefore, patients started on EXUBERA must receive comprehensive instructions on the use of the inhaler. The between-subject variability in AUC for INH (clinical formulation) appears to be comparable to that  of  SC  regular  insulin,  but  the  between-subject  variability  in  Cmax  and  Tmax  was  found  to  be higher for INH than for SC regular insulin in subjects with Type 1 DM. · Special populations No difference in pharmacokinetic profile was observed in relation to gender, age or Japanese ethnicity. Effect of smoking

The effect of smoking and/or smoking cessation for up to 13 weeks has been investigated in 4 studies. All  studies  clearly  demonstrated  that  active  smoking  significantly  increases  the  rate  and  extent  of absorption of INH compared to non-smokers (Tmax about 20-30 minutes earlier, Cmax about 3 to 5 times and AUC about 2 to 3 times higher). Smoking cessation resulted in quick changes including an initial  transient  increase  (over  the  first  day)  followed  by  a  decrease  in  bioavailability  with  a concomitant  delay  in  absorption.  These  changes  occurred  early  during  the  period  of  smoking cessation. However, data from week 3 to week 13 of smoking cessation showed that bioavailability of INH continued to be increased compared to matched non-smokers, suggesting that 'normalisation' of INH absorption  may  not  be  achieved  for  a  long  time.  Resumption  of  smoking  promptly  increased absorption  of  INH  to  pre-cessation  levels.  In  summary,  smoking  may  make  INH  absorption

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

unpredictable  and  could  result  in  poor  glycaemic  control  and  hypoglycaemia.  Accordingly,  use  in smokers and smoking should be contraindicated. See also discussion on clinical efficacy. In addition, the Applicant has provided the results of a study requested to evaluate the effect of passive smoking (environmental tobacco smoke) on bioavailability. Acute passive exposure to tobacco smoke, as opposed to active cigarette smoking, decreased bioavailability of inhaled insulin (AUC and Cmax were reduced by 17% and 29%, respectively). The study results are included in the SPC.

Since the effect of mucolytics is difficult to evaluate in interaction studies, the Applicant will address this issue as part of a study in COPD patients (study 1030).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pulmonary and airway disorders The effects of mild asthma or cold ('rhinoviral challenge') have been investigated in two studies using early  INH  formulations  and  inhaler.  In  subjects  with  mild  asthma  not  using  bronchodilators, absorption of INH was slightly but consistently less than in healthy subjects. In contrast, no difference in pharmacokinetics of INH was found between subjects with and without cold but the results from this  study  are  questionable  due  to  the  low  number  of  study  subjects  and  the  high  variability  in  PK parameters. In  subjects  with  COPD  (chronic  bronchitis  or  emphysema),  absorption  of  INH  was  increased  by approximately 2 fold compared to healthy controls. The  reason  for  this  increased  absorption  (as  opposed  to  the  decreased  absorption  in  patients  with asthma) is unclear. Overall, the timing of bronchodilator administration (30 min prior vs. 30 min after INH administration) did not affect INH bioavailability. In a small subset (n=5) of subjects with COPD who were retrospectively  determined  to  be  bronchodilator  responsive,  absorption  of  INH  increased when INH was administered 30 minutes after bronchodilator administration. However, it is difficult to draw valid conclusions from this study because of differences in dosing conditions, small sample size and  large  between-subject  variability.  Differences  in  bioavailability  of  SC  insulin  in  patients  with chronic  bronchitis  compared  to  patients  with  emphysema  are  unexplained  and  complicate  the interpretation of study results. See also clinical safety section. Obese patients Pharmacokinetics of INH was not different in obese versus normal-weight healthy subjects. In obese type  2  subjects,  INH  resulted  in  higher  Cmax  than  SC  soluble  human  insulin.  In  addition,  relative bioavailability of INH was higher than in non-obese type 1 diabetic patients. These findings are most likely due to the delayed and decreased absorption of SC insulin in obese patients. Children The PK profile of INH was found to be similar in adult and paediatric patients with diabetes. · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies Upon  CHMP  request,  formal  interaction  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  effect  of bronchodilators and respiratory steroids on bioavailability of inhaled insulin. The results demonstrate that  the  use  of  a  short-acting  bronchodilator  (salbutamol,  30  min  prior  to  inhalation  of  Exubera)  in asthmatic patients enhances the bioavailability of inhaled insulin. In contrast, inhalation of fluticasone (10  min  prior  to  inhalation  of  Exubera)  does  not  appear  to  affect  the  bioavailability  of  Exubera. Exubera  itself  does  not  change  the  bronchodilatory  response  tosalbutamol.  These  study  results  are reported in the SPC in section 4.5 and not in section 4.2, as initially claimed by the applicant, since the use of Exubera is currently not recommended in patients with underlying lung disease such as asthma or COPD, and actually contraindicated in patients with poorly controlled, unstable, or severe asthma and in patients with severe (GOLD stage III or IV) COPD.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mechanism of action and the metabolic effects of insulin are well known; human insulin lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects, decreases catabolic effects, and increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles and the liver.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The pharmacodynamics of inhaled insulin has been evaluated in three types of studies:

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised -by measuring glucose levels after insulin administration in fasting subjects with type 2 DM. -in euglycemic clamp studies in healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 DM.  In these studies, the  glucose  level  was  maintained  to  a  pre-defined  level  by  varying  the  glucose  infusion  rate (GIR). The insulin action profile was evaluated by the glucose infusion rate. -by measuring postprandial glucose levels after insulin administration in meal studies in subjects with type 1 DM. Glucodynamic responses in the pharmacology studies following administration of INH or SC insulin generally reflected the changes in insulin concentrations. In  healthy  subjects,  onset  of  action  of  INH  was  shown  to  be  as  fast  as  that  of  SC  ultrarapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and more rapid than that of SC soluble human insulin. The duration of action was  longer  for  INH  than  for  SC  insulin  lispro  and  comparable  to  SC  soluble  human  insulin.  The following figure shows the mean Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) normalised to GIRmax for each subject treatment versus time in Healthy Volunteers. Similar  results  were  observed  in  subjects  with  diabetes  where  INH  was  compared  with  SC  regular insulin The  onset  of  glucose  lowering  activity  of  INH  is  within  10  to  20  minutes,  the  maximum  effect  is observed  approximately  2  hours  after  inhalation  and  the  duration  of  action  was  determined  at approximately 6 hours. The within-subject variability of inhaled INH in glucose-lowering activity was generally comparable to that of SC regular insulin in subjects with type 1 and type 2 DM. In a chronic-dose study (1026), the effect of INH on postprandial glucose seemed well conserved after 24  weeks,  similar  to  that  of  SC  soluble  human  insulin.  Although  insulin  antibody  (IAB)  levels increased  markedly  during  the  study  period,  this  did  not  influence  glucose  pharmacodynamics  of inhaled insulin.

## Clinical efficacy

The applicant has conducted an extensive phase 2/3 clinical program to investigate efficacy and safety of INH in patients with either type 1 or type 2 DM.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No classic dose response studies were performed; INH doses chosen in the phase 2/3 trials were based on results from PK/PD studies, which is acceptable since the dose response relationship of the active substance is well known.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Treatments All  comparative  studies  were  preceded  by  a  4-week  lead-in  period  during  which  eligible  patients received the control SC insulin or OA regimen and were instructed in the use of the inhaler device. At the week 0 visit, subjects were randomised to the treatment groups. The control treatment was principally the treatment given during lead-in (except for studies 1001 and 1002). Doses of oral OA medication given during lead-in (background treatment) were to remain fixed throughout  the  study  period.  Add-on  OAs,  however,  were  titrated  according  to  a  pre-specified schedule up to week 18 (study 1001) or week 24 (study 1002), if necessary (see schedule below). Initial dosing of INH: The initially prescribed pre-meal doses were based on the patient's weight and previous response to insulin. INH was administered immediately prior to meals (within 10 min). Dose titration of insulin: INH dosing or insulin injections always had to be preceded by blood glucose checks. Patients on OAs only  had  to  perform  2-times  daily  home  glucose  monitoring  (prior  to  breakfast  and  supper).  Dose adjustments for insulin were made according to a pre-defined schedule to reach the following blood glucose levels: -Phase 2 studies: pre-meal blood glucose of 100-160 mg/dl. -Phase 3 studies: blood glucose of 80-140 mg/dl before meals and 100-160 mg/dl at bedtime except  in  study  107,  in  which  an  intensive  regimen  was  used,  the  goal  was  to  reach  80-120 mg/dl before meals, &lt; 180 mg/dl post-prandially, and 100-140 mg/dl at bedtime. The recommended dose of short-acting insulin was to be used for pre-meal glucose values in the range of  80-180  mg/dl  (80-200  mg/dL  in  phase  2  studies).  For  higher  (lower)  values  a  dose  increase (decrease) by 1mg for INH or 2-4 U for SC regular insulin was recommended. In addition to pre-meal dosing, INH could be administered on an as required basis, e.g. an additional bedtime dose of 1-2 mg for  INH  or  2-6  U  for  regular  insulin  could  be  given  in  case  bedtime  glucose  exceeded  180  mg/dl. Insulin dose was adjusted at weekly intervals, as necessary. Patients on INH were allowed to switch to SC or IV insulin during study-emergent intercurrent illness or surgery. Dose titration of add-on OAs: -In study 1001, patients randomised to adjunctive metformin underwent a period of dose titration during which the dose of metformin was increased in 500 mg steps  up to maximally 2.5 g/day. In study 1002, patients randomised to adjunctive glibenclamide underwent dose titration during which the dose of glibenclamide was increased at from 2.5 mg once daily to maximally 15 mg daily.

## Objectives

In studies in diabetic (type 1 or type 2) subjects using SC insulin at study entry, the objective was to determine whether glycaemic control could be achieved at least as effectively with an insulin regimen involving pre-meal (TID) INH plus SC basal insulin (Conventional insulin regimen except in study 107 where it consisted in an intensive regimen - see above 'Dose titration of insulin').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  studies  in  type  2  diabetic  patients  not  using  SC  insulin  at  study  entry,  the  objective  was  to determine whether:

- -INH, either alone (Studies 109 and 110) or in addition to OA treatment (Studies 104, 109, and the high HBA1c strata of Studies 1001 and 1002) was superior to an exclusively OA therapeutic regimen in providing glycaemic control,
- -INH in addition to OA treatment (low HbA1c strata of Studies 1001 and 1002) was non-inferior to combined OA treatment.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Other objectives in all studies were the local tolerance and safety of INH therapy and its effects on measures of pulmonary function. Outcome/endpoints The primary endpoint was the Mean change in HbA1c from baseline to end of study (except for study 110). The primary endpoint in study 110 was the proportion of subjects reaching the end of study goal of HbA1c &lt; 8.0 %. The main secondary endpoints were: change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 (study 110 only), proportion of patients with acceptable (HbA1c &lt; 8%) or good (HbA1c &lt;7%) glycaemic control at end of  treatment  (phase  3  studies),  change  in  fasting  glucose  and  meal  glucose  response,  incidence  and severity  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes,  body  weight,  mean  daily  insulin  doses,  QOL  and  treatment satisfaction (self-administered questionnaire). Definitions of hypoglycaemia: -Mild-moderate:  Typical  symptoms  without  glucose  measurement;  Typical  symptoms  with glucose measurement &lt; 60 mg/dl; or Any glucose measurement &lt; 50 mg/dl. Prompt resolution of symptoms with food intake. -Severe: (1) the subject was unable to treat him/herself; and (2) the subject exhibited symptoms of central nervous system impairment; and (3) either blood glucose was &lt;50 mg/dL or, if not measured,  hypoglycaemic  symptoms  were  reversed  by  a  glucose  source.  This  prospective definition  in  phase  3  studies  was  retroactively  applied  to  phase  2  studies  (where  initially  the definition of severe hypoglaemia was: subject requires the assistance of another person; coma and/or seizures) for consistency. A pre-specified 16-item questionnaire was used to assess satisfaction with insulin treatment during the study. Questions related to advocacy, burden, convenience, efficacy, flexibility, general satisfaction, hassle, interference, pain, preference, side effects, social aspects. The Diabetes Quality of Life and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (Phase V Outcomes System) was  used  to  assess  satisfaction  with  diabetes  treatment,  quality  of  life  and  preferences  during  the study.    Satisfaction  scales  measured  advocacy,  burden,  convenience,  efficacy,  flexibility,  general satisfaction,  hassle,  interference,  pain,  preference,  side  effects,  and  social  aspects.    Quality  of  life scales measured perceived health, diabetes symptoms interference, sleep, vitality, sexual satisfaction, anxiety, affect, behaviour/emotional control, psychological well-being, life satisfaction, mental health, cognitive performance, and symptom distress. Sample size

In non-inferiority studies, sample size was estimated to provide 80% power to ensure that the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI (97.5% CI for combined strata in studies 1001 and 1002) of the difference between  groups  in  change  from  baseline  HbA1c  did  not  exceed  1.0%  (absolute  units)  in  phase  2 studies or 0.5% in phase 3 studies.

In superiority studies, sample size was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a difference between the groups in HbA1c of 1.0% in phase 2 studies or 0.7% in phase 3 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  Study  110,  a  sample  size  was  estimated  to  provide  80%  power  to  detect  a  difference  between groups of at least 20% in response rates, using a 2-sided 5% level of significance, and assuming a 35% response rate in the rosiglitazone group. The number of patients was later increased to 150 per group to accommodate the required power for patient satisfaction and QOL assessments.

## Randomisation

Medicinal product no longer authorised Patients were randomised 1:1 to the two treatment groups or 1:1:1 to the 3 treatment groups (Study 109). In the phase 2 studies, randomisation was stratified according to the patients' week -1 HbA1c (&gt; 8.5% or ≤ 8.5% in studies 102 and 103, &gt; 10.0% or ≤ 10.0% in study 104). In studies 1001 and 1002 subjects were stratified according to their HbA1c at week-1; low stratum (HbA1c ≥ 8% to ≤ 9.5%) and high stratum (HbA1c ≥ 9.5% to ≤ 12.0%). Statistical methods ITT population was defined as all randomised patients with a baseline value and at least one postbaseline measurement. It was the primary analysis population in superiority trials. PP  population  was  defined  as  subset  of  the  ITT  population  without  major  protocol  violations, randomised  into  the  correct  stratum,  have  received  at  least  half  the  protocol  required  duration  of treatment  as  assigned  by  the  randomisation  scheme,  baseline  and  at  least  one  evaluable  HbA1c assessment (defined as having been preceded by a treatment duration of 75% or more of the elapsed time since the previous assessment). It was the primary analysis population in non-inferiority trials. Analysis  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  for  hypoglycaemia  was  performed  for  both  the  ITT  and  PP population. For other secondary efficacy endpoints analysis was performed for the primary analysis population only. Last observation carried over (LOCF) method was used. Most studies in the phase II / phase III programme used end of study change from baseline in HbA1c as the primary endpoint and an ANCOVA-model including baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate and centre and treatment group as categorical variables. Non-inferiority margins were set to 0.5% deterioration with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c in phase III studies (and to 1% in phase II studies). In superiority trials (except for study 110) relevance margins were set at 1.0 % for phase 2 studies and 0.7 % for Phase 3 studies. The relevance margin used in study 110 was 20%.

Secondary endpoints -The proportion of subjects in each treatment group achieving good (HbA1c &lt;7%) or acceptable (HbA1c &lt;8%) glycaemic control did not differ between treatment groups. Subjects ≥ 18 Years of Age Achieving End-of Study HbA1c &lt; 8% or &lt;7% - PP population -In studies 106 and 107 INH patients had a significant decline in fasting glucose compared to SC insulin  patients.  Mean  difference  in  change  (95%  CI)  was  -29mg/dL  (-49,  -9)  for study  106  and  37mg/dL  (-60,  -14)  for  study  107.    In  study  102  the  decline  in  fasting  glucose  was  not  different between groups. -In  studies  106  and  102,  the  change  in  the  postprandial  glucose  increment  was  comparable between treatment groups. However, in Study 107, the change in glucose increment was statistically different  between  the  two  groups  with  INH  subjects  exhibiting  an  increase  in  glucose  increment insulin compared to SC subjects. -Daily insulin dose: In  all  3  studies,  baseline  short  and  long-acting  insulin  doses  were  similar across treatment groups. During the treatment period, a shift from long-acting to short-acting insulin occurred in the INH group but not in the SC group. At the end of study, the short-acting insulin doses in  the  INH  group  were  approximately  2.3,  2.2  and  1.3  fold  higher  in  studies  102,  106  and  107, respectively, than those in the SC insulin groups (calculation based on the assumption that 1 mg INH corresponds to approximately 3 U of SC regular insulin) but total daily insulin doses remained similar. -Hypoglycaemia: The  percentage  of  patients  who  experienced  a  hypoglycaemic  event  and  the respective event rates were similar in the INH and SC insulin groups. In study 107, event rates for severe hypoglycaemia was higher in patients using INH. See clinical safety section.

- -In Study 108, the decrease in fasting glucose levels was significantly greater in INH than in SC insulin  patients  (mean  difference  in  change  -16  mg/dL,  95%  CI:  -27,  -5).    In  study  103,  the change was not different.

Based  on  the  95%  confidence  intervals  for  the  adjusted  treatment  differences  and  the predefined non-inferiority margins, INH was non-inferior to treatment with SC insulin. Results were similar for ITT analysis.

- -Daily insulin dose: At baseline, mean daily insulin doses were similar across treatment groups for both short and long-acting insulin. During the 24-week treatment period, a shift from long-acting to short-acting insulin occurred in the INH group but not in the SC group. At 24 weeks the amount of daily  short-acting  insulin  used  in  the  INH  group  was  about  1.9  fold  of  that  used  in  the  SC  insulin group but total daily insulin doses remained similar. There was a slight and similar increase in total insulin dose over time in both groups.

For  subjects  into  the  low  strata  of  studies  1001  or  1002,  the  decline  in  HbA1c  was  similar  in  the INH+OA and OA groups, and the upper bound of the 95% CI did not exceed 0.5%.

Medicinal product no longer authorised * HbA1c &lt; 8% was the primary efficacy endpoint in Study 110 SU = sulfonylurea; Met = Metformin Fasting glucose In Study 109, both the INH monotherapy and INH+OA groups had a significantly greater decrease in fasting plasma glucose than the OA group. Mean difference in change (95% CI) was -24 mg/dl (-36, 11) for the INH monotherapy group and -53 mg/dl (-66, -41) for the INH+OA group compared to the OA group. Results on fasting glucose levels obtained from the phase 2 study 104 (INH+OA vs. OA) support those from study 109 (mean difference in change -61 mg/dL, 95% CI: -81, -41). In Study 110, the decrease in fasting glucose levels was similar in the two treatment groups. In both studies 1001 and 1002, the decreases from baseline fasting plasma glucose were similar, and the  difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups  was  small  regardless  of  treatment  received  or  the stratum into which subjects were placed. Postprandial glucose increment

In Study 109, both the INH monotherapy and INH+OA groups had a significant decrease in glucose increment compared to subjects who continued their pre-study OA regimen and showed no change. Mean difference in change (95% CI) was -41 mg/dL (-56, -25) for the INH monotherapy group and 22 mg/dL (-38, -7) for the INH+OA group compared to the OA group. Results from phase 2 study 104 (INH+OA vs. OA) showed a trend in the same direction (mean difference -16.4 mg/dL, 95% CI: 34.6, 0.8).

In Study 110, the decrease in glucose increment was similar in both groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The decrease in glucose increment was comparable in both the low and high strata for Study 1001 as well  as  the  low  stratum  for  Study  1002.  Only  the  high  stratum  INH  group  showed  a  significantly greater reduction in the glucose increment than did the OA group (mean difference -18 mg/dL, 95% CI: -25, -10).

## Daily insulin dose

Medicinal product no longer authorised In  all  studies,  a  small  increase  in  mean  absolute  daily  insulin  doses  was  observed  over  time.  This might have been primarily due to the concomitant increase in body weight associated with insulin use since the doses corrected for body weight increased only minimally. In study 1001, all control patients were taking the protocol specified amounts of metformin of between 500 mg once daily and 1 g twice daily. The doses of the background sulfonylurea were comparable between the INH and metformin groups and remained stable throughout the study. In study 1002, the mean doses of glibenclamide in the control group at 4 weeks were 4.3 mg in the low stratum and 4.8 mg in the high stratum. The mean doses at 24 weeks were 6.8 mg and 8.5 mg, respectively. All subjects were taking the protocol specified amount of metformin of 2g daily. Hypoglycaemia In  all  studies  except  for  study  1002,  INH  subjects  experienced  a  significantly  greater  incidence  of hypoglycaemia when compared to subjects receiving OA therapy alone. In Study 1002, subjects in the high  stratum  who  received  INH  had  a  hypoglycaemic  event  rate  that  was  twice  that  of  subjects receiving glibenclamide whereas subjects in the low stratum who received INH had a lower rate of hypoglycaemic events.

No INH subjects in Studies 110 or 1002 and no OA subject in any of the studies experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event. One INH subject in each Studies 104 (INH+OA), 109 (INH), and 1001 (high stratum, INH+SU) experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event.

## Body weight

## · Clinical studies in special populations

Medicinal product no longer authorised In every study, subjects receiving INH, either alone or in combination with OA therapy, had a 2.2 to 4.5 kg gain in body weight over the course of the study.  By comparison, body weight in subjects who continued  their  pre-study  OA  therapeutic  regimen  in  Study  109  remained  unchanged.    Also, sulfonylurea monotherapy failures (Study 1001) experienced no increase in weight when metformin was added to their treatment. Weight gains were statistically different in Study 109 (mean weight gain 3.4 kg, 3.0 kg, and 0.0 kg in the INH monotherapy, INH+OA, and OA groups, respectively) and Study 1001  (mean  weight  gain:  high  stratum:  4.5  kg  and  -0.1  kg  in  the  INH+SUand  Met+SU  groups, respectively;  low  stratum:  3.0  kg  and  -0.3  kg  in  the  INH+SUand  Met+SU  groups,  respectively). However, in Study 1002, subjects who failed on metformin had a similar weight gain when either INH or the insulin secretagogue, glibenclamide, was added to their treatment. Two-year report on combined studies 1001 /1002 The protocols were amended to extend the duration from 24 weeks to 104 weeks. Additional therapies, including  subcutaneous  insulin  were  allowed  in  all  subjects.  The  baseline  data  from  the  Week  104 cohort were representative of the subjects originally recruited. The demographic characteristics of the Week 104 completers were similar between the INH and oral agents treatment groups and between males  and  females.  The  overall  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  was  similar  in  both  groups.  There  was  one severe hypoglycaemic event in each group.

## Paediatric population

The applicant does not currently seek an indication for EXUBERA in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients with type 1 DM were treated in studies 106, 107, and 1009.  Patients who completed one of these studies were eligible to participate in extension study 111.

Study  1009  was  a  3-month  study  in  paediatric  patients  (Age  6  to  11  years)  with  type  1  DM.  The design,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  and  endpoints  were  similar  to  studies  106  and  107.  For inclusion, previous insulin regimen must have included a minimum of 16 U of SC insulin per day

Results are reported for study 1009 and paediatric subpopulations of studies 106 and 107.

## Disposition of Subjects &lt; 18 Years of Age with Type 1 Diabetes

Medicinal product no longer authorised In all three studies, subjects demonstrated a similar change in HbA1c, regardless of treatment group. Change from Baseline in HbA1c, % - PP analysis *Adjusted mean difference between groups (INH - SC) in change from baseline and 95% CI were based on the primary model with terms for baseline, treatment, and centre. Treatment  groups  were  similar  with  respect  to  the  percentage  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  &lt;8%  or &lt;7% in all three studies. In  all  3  studies,  baseline  daily  insulin  doses  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups.  During  the treatment  phase,  a  shift  from  long-acting  to  short-acting  insulin  occurred  in  INH-treated  patients  in studies 106 and 1009 but total insulin doses (adjusted for body weight) increased only slightly (as did total daily insulin doses for the SC groups). Total and severe hypoglycaemic event rates are presented in the tables below. Overall, total event rates and severe hypoglycaemia event rates were similar between treatment groups.

A total of 342 subjects ≥ 65 years of age received INH during the clinical development program, 104 of them in the Completed, Controlled Phase 2/3 Studies. However, only 37 subjects were ≥ 75 years. Therefore,  a  statement  that  experience  with  INH  in  patients ≥ 75  years  of  age  is  limited  has  been included in the SPC. In addition, the Applicant has committed to obtain further data on efficacy and safety of Exubera in the very elderly from a large simple trial ('real world study', see RMP).

Medicinal product no longer authorised *Number of events/100 subject-months. In all studies, both treatment groups showed a similar increase in body weight. Patients that completed one of the studies 106, 107 or 1009 and entered study 111 were pooled. Although  no  comparator  data  is  available,  the  data  suggest  that  HbA1c  remained  relatively  stable throughout the 24-month course of Study 111. Average daily INH insulin dose continued to increase in this paediatric population. On a per kilogram basis, the mean daily INH dose increased only slightly from 0.23 to 0.29 mg/kg during the 2-year observation period. Overall hypoglycaemic event rate was about  one  third  lower  during  the  second  than  during  the  first  year  of  treatment.  The  severe hypoglycaemic event rate was fairly constant during the 2-year observation period. HbA1c (%) Versus Duration of Inhaled Insulin Treatment in Subjects &lt; 18 Years of Age Who Completed At Least 24 Months of  Treatment * Baseline refers to baseline of the parent study Underlying lung disease, Asthma and COPD The  presence  of  mild  underlying  lung  disease  (e.g.  well-controlled  mild  asthma  or  COPD)  did  not influence efficacy in a pooled analysis. However, very preliminary results on studies 1028 ('asthma' study) and study 1030 ('COPD study') showed an increased in the rate of non-severe exacerbations. Therefore,  use  of  Exubera  in  patients  with  underlying  lung  disease  such  as  asthma  or  COPD  is currently  not  recommended.  Respiratory  tract  infections  did  not  influence  glycaemic  control  or hypoglycaemia  rate.  There  is  no  experience  with  Exubera  in  patients  with  pneumonia.  This  is appropriately stated in the SPC.

INH was similarly  efficacious  in  young  and  elderly,  and  in  obese  and  non-obese  diabetic  subjects. There were no gender differences that were unique to INH.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study 1022 is  a  two-year, outpatient, open-label, parallel-group comparative efficacy and safety trial of  EXUBERA  compared  with  SC  human  insulin  therapy  in  adult  subjects  with  type  1  diabetes mellitus. Main inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 years, type 1 DM, currently on stable SC insulin regimen, HbA1c between 5.5% and 11%. The primary objective was to establish pulmonary safety of inhaled insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes; change from baseline HbA1c was a secondary endpoint. Nevertheless,  results  (see  below)  did  not  show  clinically  relevant  difference  in  glycaemic  control between the two treatment arms. The treatment group difference at Month 24 (LOCF) of 0.25% (90% CI: 0.134, 0.372) is within the non-inferiority criteria employed in earlier efficacy trials (upper bound of CI ≤ 0.5%). Study 1022 - Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c, %) Observed Value and Change from Baseline in Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Study 1029 is  a  two-year, outpatient, open-label, parallel-group comparative efficacy and safety trial of  EXUBERA  compared  with  SC  human  insulin  therapy  in  adult  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes mellitus. Main inclusion criteria were: age 35 to 75 years, type 2 DM for more than 1 year, currently on stable SC insulin regimen, HbA1c between 5.5% and 11%. The primary objective was to establish pulmonary safety of inhaled insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes; change from baseline HbA1c was a secondary endpoint. 1-year HbA1c interim analysis data are summarised below. Glycemic control did not differ between treatment groups. Study 1029 - Summary of mean HbA1c (%)

Hypoglycaemia data in studies 1022 and 1029 were comparable for INH and SC insulin. Study 1027 was 24-week open-label, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group design study in type 1 diabetes patients who received either INH or a short-acting SC insulin during a 12-week

'comparative treatment phase' and a short-acting SC insulin during 12-week 'follow up phase'. The primary endpoint was the FEV1 and DLco response status. Efficacy as measured by HbA1c was a secondary endpoint.

There  were  no  clinically  relevant  group  differences  in  HbA1c  decrease  at  any  time.  During  the comparative phase, the overall risk of a hypoglycaemic event was slightly higher for the INH group relative to the SC group, with a risk ratio of 1.24 (90% CI, 1.17 to 1.31). Event rate tended to decline over time. The risk of a severe hypoglycaemic events phase was lower for the INH group relative to the SC group, with a risk ratio of 0.52 (90 % CI, 0.31 to 0.87).

Based on the submitted data, both short- and long-term efficacy have been sufficiently demonstrated in  patients  with  type  2  DM.  INH  was  shown  to  be  non-inferior  to  SC  short-acting  or  rapid-acting insulin  and  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  patients  not  sufficiently  controlled  on  OAs  alone.  In patients poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥ 9.5% to ≤ 12.0%, high stratum) on OA monotherapy, INH add-on was  superior  to  OA  add-on.  In  patients  with  HbA1c  levels  between  between  8.0%  and  9.5%  (low stratum)  on  OA  monotherapy,  INH  add-on  was  non-inferior  to  OA  add-on  therapy.  In  addition,  in patients  failing  exercise  and  diet,  INH  monotherapy  was  superior  to  rosiglitazone.  Rosiglitazone, however, is not approved for first-line therapy in this indication. A comparative study with metformin, the current first-line therapy, has not been performed. In patients with type 2 DM, HbA1c values could be maintained in the extension studies for up to 4 years without substantial increase in INH dose. In patients with type 1 DM, efficacy of INH has been clearly demonstrated for periods up to 6 months. Conclusions  on  long-term  efficacy  in  this  patient  population  were  hampered  by  the  high  overall discontinuation rates (50% and more) in the follow-up studies and the discontinuation rate of 6.7% due to 'insufficient treatment response' in study 111. In addition, in the controlled phase of extension

Medicinal product no longer authorised Studies 102E, 103E, 104E : Subjects who completed the Phase 2 studies (Studies 102, 103, or 104) were eligible to enroll in open-label, extensions of those studies. There were a total of 5 extension periods, spanning a total of 6 years. Generally,  the  glycaemic  control  achieved  in  the  parent  studies  was  maintained  throughout  the extension studies although sample size was low in these studies. Study 111: Subjects who completed studies 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, or 1009 were eligible to enter study 111, an open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomised, long-term safety study of up to three years. Most patients completing the parent studies (72 to 95%) entered study 111 (1290 patients (550 type 1, 740 type 2 diabetics)) but discontinuation rates during the following years was high. All subjects in study 111, including those coming from the control arm of a previous study, received INH. Exclusion and withdrawal criteria, INH dosing, titration schedule and home glucose monitoring were the same as in the parent studies. Generally,  the  glycaemic  control  in  patients  with  type  1  or  type  2  diabetes  achieved  in  the  parent studies was maintained throughout the uncontrolled extension study. Due to the finding of accelerated decline in lung function, particularly in FEV1, study protocol 111 was  amended  to  include  a  subsequent  controlled  part,  where  patients  were  randomized  to  either continue INH for another 6 months or to switch to SC fast-acting insulin. Patients that were switched back to SC insulin showed improved glycaemic control compared to patients that remained on INH · Discussion on clinical efficacy The  applicant  has  conducted  a  comprehensive  clinical  development  programme.  All  Phase  2/3 controlled, completed studies used a randomised, multi-centre, active-controlled, open-label, parallelgroup design. All subjects with type 1 DM and subjects with type 2 DM using insulin received subcutaneous (SC) basal (intermediate- or long-acting-) insulin in addition to SC short-acting insulin or INH. The most recent clinical trials used predominantly insulin analogues in the comparator arm. Patients with type 2 DM not treated with insulin at baseline received INH either as monotherapy or as add-on to an OA regimen.

study  111,  patients  with  type  1  or  type  2  DM  that  were  switched  back  to  conventional  diabetes therapy, showed somewhat improved glycaemic control compared to patients that remained on INH. The explanation for the high discontinuation rates including the high burden of participation in studies of  such  long  duration  was  accepted.  In  addition  it  was  shown,  that  so-called  'insufficient  treatment response' was not associated with particularly high HbA1c or insulin antibody levels.

The  applicant's  arguments  that  the  small  improvement  in  patients  switching  back  from  INH  to  SC insulin  observed  in  study  111  was  not  a  consistent  finding  in  the  database  and  the  explanation  of stricter self-monitoring and dose adjustment after the switch were accepted.

Medicinal product no longer authorised It  was  questioned  whether  in  study  1022  in  patients  with  type  1  diabetes,  the  efficacy  of  inhaled insulin  may  be  inferior  to  SC  insulin.  Considering  that  the  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to assess  pulmonary  safety,  the  difference  in  HbA1c  was  not  considered  clinically  relevant  between treatment groups. The pharmacology studies had revealed that one 3 mg blister is not interchangeable with three 1 mg blisters.  Consecutive  inhalation  of  three  1  mg  doses  causes  an  approximately  40%  higher  insulin exposure  than  inhalation  of  one  3  mg  dose.  A  1 mg  blister  of  inhaled  insulin  is  approximately equivalent  to  3  IU  of  subcutaneously  injected  fast-acting  human  insulin.  A  3 mg  blister  of  inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 8 IU of subcutaneously injected fast-acting human insulin. The lack of interchangeability raised three related clinical concerns: (1) efficacy and safety of dose titration with the two blister strengths, (2) possible mix-up of 1 mg and 3 mg blisters, (3) hypoglycaemia due to use of three 1 mg instead of one 3 mg blister (e.g. in case the patient runs out of 3 mg blisters). Dose titration  with  the  two  blister  strengths  has  been  shown to be efficacious, safe and practicable in the extensive  clinical  trial  programme.  In  addition,  confusion  of  the  two  blister  strengths  has  not  been reported in the clinical  trials.  Patients  with  diabetes  are  accustomed  to  using  different  insulins.  The CHMP therefore accepted that the risk due to the lack of interchangibility of the two strengths could be solved with appropriate warnings in the SPC, PL and Labelling of the product as well as through educational material to be provided by the marketing authorisation holder. Upon CHMP request, the applicant  also  committed  to  improve  colour  differentiation  and  to  implement  additional  tactile (e.g. embossed) markings on the protruding end of the blister, which will allow to clearly distinguish the two blister strengths even when the blister is already inserted and in visually impaired patients. 1 mg and 3 mg blisters should not be marketed in a combined package to avoid confusing the blisters with the different dose strengths. A 1 mg blister of inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected fastacting human insulin and represents the smallest possible titration step. Therefore, EXUBERA should be used with caution in patients of low body weight. The use of EXUBERA in patients requiring dose titrations of less than 1 mg is not recommended. Exubera  has  a  faster  onset  of  action  than  subcutaneously  administered  soluble  human  insulin. Therefore, it should be given within 10 minutes before the start of a meal. Patients must not smoke during therapy due to the risk of hypoglycaemia related to the great increase of absorption of INH. In  trials  involving  patients  with  type  2  diabetes,  a  marked  difference  was  observed  between  the number of subjects who were screened and who were randomised raising the question whether the study population would be representative of the target population. The main reason for non-eligibility for  the  clinical  trials  was  found  to  be  abnormal  pulmonary  function  (about  1  in  4  of  the  screened population). This finding of high prevalence of impaired lung function in patients with diabetes is of concern, particularly with respect to a possible further decline associated with the use of INH. (see safety section)

In all clinical trials, no more than 2 inhalations per dosing session were to be administered initially. In the  course  of  the  studies,  however,  up  to  6  (and  rarely  more)  inhalations  per  dosing  session  were performed without negative impact on glycaemic control or hypoglycaemia risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall treatment satisfaction was found to be higher for INH than for SC insulin or OAs and was closely related to perceived improved glycaemic control. However, due to the open-label design of the studies, evaluation of treatment satisfaction may have been subject to bias and should be interpreted with caution.

In summary, sustained efficacy of INH, similar to that of rapid-acting or ultrarapid-acting insulin, has been sufficiently demonstrated in both patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. At present, the main added value of INH appears to be the avoidance of SC injections.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Due  to  the  insufficient  data  from  the  clinical  development  programme  and  very  preliminary  study results from studies 1028 (asthma) and 1030 (COPD) showing an Exubera-associated increase in the rate of non-severe exacerbations, the use of Exubera in patients with underlying lung disease such as asthma or COPD is not recommended and contraindicated in case of poorly controlled, unstable or severe asthma and severe (Gold stage III or IV) COPD. EXUBERA has  been  administered  to  patients  with  intercurrent  respiratory  illness  (e.g.  bronchitis, upper  respiratory  tract  infections)  during  clinical  trials.  Increased  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  or  poor glycaemic control has not been observed in these trials. During intercurrent respiratory illness close monitoring of blood glucose concentrations is recommended. There is no experience with Exubera in patients with pneumonia and this is stated in the SPC. The  applicant  has  roughly  outlined  their  intended  paediatric  development  plan.  It  should  take  into account  that  type  1  and  type  2  diabetes  are  distinct  entities  with  different  treatment  options  and possibly different outcome. The applicant committed to provide a paediatric development programme as a follow-up measure. Clinical safety · Patient exposure The  initial  safety  summary  presented  by  the  Applicant  included  safety  data  from  50  studies  in  the clinical development program of INH, 31 clinical pharmacology studies, and 19 phase 2/3 studies. As  of  June  25,  2004,  the  Controlled  Phase  2/3  protocol  set  included  1,975  INH  treated  and  1,837 comparator treated adult diabetic subjects ( ≥ 18 years old). Overall, the safety of Exubera alone, or in combination with subcutaneous insulin or oral agents has been evaluated in clinical studies of more than 2700 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including more than 1975 adults exposed for greater than 6 months and more than 745 adults for greater than 2 years. · Adverse events The  most  frequently  reported  all  causality  and/or  treatment-related  adverse  events  (AEs)  were hypoglycaemia,  respiratory  tract  infection  and  cough.  Cough,  respiratory  disorders,  rhinitis  and pharyngitis  were  more  common  in  the  INH  group  than  in  the  comparator  groups.  The  cough associated  with  Exubera  occurred  usually  within  seconds  to  minutes  after  inhalation  and  tended  to decrease over time. Of those events occurring at less than 5% incidence in any treatment group, chest pain (not of cardiac origin), dry mouth, dyspnoea, epistaxis and increased sputum occurred at greater incidence in the INH than comparator groups. Adverse events were predominantly of mild severity.

As relevant example, the common adverse events in early completed controlled phase 2/3 studies (102, 106, 107, 1009, 103, 104, 108, 109, 110, 1001, 1002) are provided the following tables for the Type 1and Type 2 DM adult patients, respectively.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia was the most common AE among INH- or SC insulin-treated subjects, occurring in nearly all patients with type 1 DM and the majority of patients with type 2 DM treated with either form of insulin. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Whereas the proportion of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia and the overall hypoglycaemia event rates were similar or even lower, the rate of severe hypoglycaemic episodes appeared to be higher in INH-treated  compared  to  SC  insulin-treated  patients  with  type  1  DM  in  study  107,  in  which  an intensive insulin regimen was used. These hypoglycaemic events in the INH group occurred primarily at night and during early morning hours. A slight tendency of increased rate of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was also observed in other early studies involving patients with type 1 DM. Therefore, an analysis  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  episodes  rates  was  requested  for  all  subjects  with  type  1  DM, including data from more recent studies (See table below).

Medicinal product no longer authorised FAS=Full Analysis Set The results from this extended database are reassuring. There was no confirmation of the concern, based on  data  from  study  107,  that  in  particular  type  1  diabetes  patients  on  intensive  insulin  regimen  may experience  severe  hypoglycaemia  more  frequently  when  using  INH  compared  to  SC  insulin  .  The increased rate of severe hypoglycaemic events in study 107 was attributed to a higher number of patients experiencing recurrent events (in particular one patient with 12 severe events, most of which were not verified by blood glucose measurements). In addition, the rate of severe hypoglycemic events decreased over time probably due to increasing familiarity with INH administration and regimen. High insulin antibody levels were not associated with increased hypoglycaemia risk. All submitted data demonstrate that INH use is not associated with an increased hypoglycaemia risk in patients with type 2 DM. · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events As  of  the  16  September  2003  cut-off  for  deaths  and  other  serious  adverse  events,  22  subjects,  all adults,  in  the  INH  clinical  development  program  had  died  during  or  within  30  days  following treatment. This total included: 8 (0.4%) of 1,951 subjects who received INH in Controlled Phase 2/3 studies, 3 (0.2%) of 1,815 subjects who received comparator in Controlled Phase 2/3 studies, and 11 (0.8%) of 1,449 subjects who received INH in extension studies. None  of  these  deaths  are  judged  as  being  related  to  study  drug.  Two  deaths  of  unknown  cause occurred  during  the  treatment  phase  of  the  studies,  one  in  the  INH  group  and  one  in  a  comparator group. No autopsy was performed in either case. There  were  no  clear  differences  in  event  rates  for  any  all-causality  serious  AE  between  treatment groups in both patients with type 1 or type 2 DM. The most common all-causality serious AEs occurring among adult type 1 subjects were hypoglycaemia and loss of consciousness, which occurred at comparable frequencies in both groups.

In  the  all  phase  2/3  protocol  set,  five  patients  were  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer.  Three  patients  had received  INH  and  two  had  received  SC  insulin  or  OA  only.  All  concerned  subjects  were  former smokers and among subject with type 2 DM.

## Pulmonary function

Across studies, INH treated subjects experienced a small but consistent decline in FEV1 (30-40ml on average) and to a lesser extent in DLco compared to their comparator-treated counterparts (see figure below).

Figure 2. Adjusted Mean Treatment Group Differences and 95% Confidence Intervals for FEV, Change from Baseline (L): Completed Controlled

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  treatment  group  differences  were  characterised  by  shifts  in  the  entire  distribution  curves  for change-from-baseline values, rather than by a small number of subjects with extreme values (outliers). The overall incidence in large declines in FEV1 (&gt;20% from baseline) was small and similar in both groups (2.8% in Exubera-treated and 2.6% in comparator-treated patients). However, it could not be excluded  that  a  subgroup  of  patients  may  be  more  sensitive  to  the  effect  of  inhaled  insulin  on  the respiratory tract. Therefore and because of the notion that even diabetic patients on standard treatment (oral  agents  or  SC  insulin)  may  exhibit  a  more  rapid  decline  in  FEV1  than  the  general  population, monitoring  of  lung  function  was  considered  necessary  to  identify  such  patients  and  to  avoid unacceptably  large  declines  in  lung  function  during  treatment  with  INH.  As  stated  in  the  SPC,  all patients  should  have  baseline  evaluation  of  lung  function  (FEV1)  before  starting  treatment  with Exubera  and  regular  follow-up  evaluations  thereafter.  Exubera  should  be  discontinued  if  FEV1 declines more than 20% from baseline regardless of a causal relationship.. Decline over time is illustrated in the figure below for studies 1001 / 1002. The accelerated decline was usually limited to the first weeks or months of treatment. The CHMP challenged the Applicant's claim that the decline in FEV1 is non-progressive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  results  also  revealed  a  higher  than  expected  FEV1  decline  in  the  comparator  groups:  a normal FEV1 decline of 30ml / y in healthy adults is reported in the literature but in the control group an adjusted mean annual rate of change of around 70 ml was found. This finding was unexpected and warrants further investigation. Since about 40% of patients in both treatment groups were ex-smokers, a subgroup analysis was requested by the CHMP to investigate whether decline in PFT was dependent on smoking history. The requested analysis suggests that ex-smoking status doesn't affect the decline in  lung  function  in  either  Exubera  or  comparator-treated  patients.  Alternative  explanations  for  the higher  than  expected  FEV1  decline  in  the  comparator  groups  such  as  existence  of  a  hypothetical 'diabetes lung' were discussed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Some  analyses  provided  contrasting  results.  For  example,  the  reported  'adjusted  [for  physiological parameters known to affect lung function] difference in change from baseline' was highest after 24 weeks of treatment without further increase up to 104 weeks, but, the mean (unadjusted) decline in FEV1 was 87 ml during the first and 102 ml during the second year of INH treatment and was 63 ml during the first and 55 ml during the second year of comparator treatment. Nevertheless, it appears that the acceleration of the FEV1 decline is largely limited to the first 3 months of treatment. Although the difference in the slope of the FEV1 decline beyond month 3 is not significant, it cannot be excluded be that with a longer duration or a higher power this difference becomes significant. No risk factors could be identified  that  were  associated  with  a  large  decline  in  FEV1.  The  comparative  extension  studies 1022  and  1029  as  well  as  the  planned  large  simple  study  (1069),  which  are  part  of  the  RMP,  are expected to provide additional information on long-term pulmonary safety (see RMP). Reversibility of the initial decline in FEV1 was seen in most patients after treatment with Exubera for up  to  two  years  (Studies  1001/1002).  Improvement  in  FEV1  also  occurred  in  most  patients  with  a large decline (&gt;20% from baseline). Discontinuation of INH treatment for 6 months in the controlled part  of  extension  Study  111  (treatment  arms:  continue  vs.  discontinue  INH)  resulted  in  changes  in FEV1 favouring the group that discontinued INH. This effect was fully manifest within 1 month. The mean  treatment  effect  6  months  after  discontinuing  INH  treatment  of  -0.042  L  was  similar  in magnitude and opposite in direction to that observed within the first 3-6 months of treatment initiation. Discontinuation of INH  treatment also resulted in an increase in DLco  at 1 month  postdiscontinuation. The treatment effect was sustained at 3 months, but diminished at 6 months due to an apparent increase in DLco in the INH group. Studies 1001 / 1002 showed reversibility of PFT decline after  long-term  treatment  of  up  to  2  years;  resolution  of  treatment  group  differences  in  FEV1 following 2 years of continuous INH exposure occurred within 6 weeks of discontinuation of INH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  unexpected  finding  of  high  prevalence  of  impaired  pulmonary  function  in  diabetic  patients screened  for  INH  trials  and  the  fact  that  patients  with  asthma  or  COPD  are  often  undetected,  were additional  reasons  for  CHMP  to  recommend  that  all  patients  should  have  pulmonary  function evaluated before initiating INH, and follow-up examinations.

The mechanism of pulmonary impairment is unclear and should be further investigated. The Applicant has  committed  to  and  already  started  two  mechanistic  'bronchoalveolar  lavage  studies',  one  in patients with type 1 diabetes (Study 1052) and one in patients with type 2 diabetes (Study 1053) (see risk management plan). Since insulin therapy usually is a lifelong therapy, long-term pulmonary safety is of utmost importance.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Laboratory findings As  expected  for  a  diabetic  population,  the  most  commonly  reported  laboratory  abnormality  was glycosuria. Otherwise, the rates of laboratory test abnormalities were not clearly different. Immunological events Insulin antibodies (IABs) developed more frequently and mean levels of IABs were higher in patients who  switched  their  SC  fast-acting  insulin  to  Exubera  compared  to  subjects  who  remained  on  SC insulin, particularly in patients with type 1 DM. Additional risk factors appear to be young age and female  gender  as  well  as  previous  insulin  exposure  in  patients  with  type  2  DM.  IAB  development usually occurred during the first 6-12 months of INH treatment without further increase thereafter. See table below. Antibody Levels at Baseline and End of Study: Early Completed Controlled Phase 2/3 Studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

INH  associated  antibodies  are  of  the  IgG  class,  as  are  of  subcutaneous  insulin  associated  insulin antibodies.    In  a  small  exploratory  study  (study  1026)  INH-associated  IABs  were  found  to  be predominantly low-affinity high-capacity antibodies. High-affinity low-capacity IABs may lead to a clinical picture of insulin resistance whereas high titres of low-affinity high-capacity IABs may act as a reservoir for insulin leading to delayed release and delayed hypoglycaemia.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In patients with type 1 DM, mean IAB levels fell by about 60% relative to end of treatment values within the initial 3 months after discontinuation of INH. Among subjects with type 2 DM, mean IAB level also fell after discontinuation of INH but the decline was slightly smaller and more protracted than in type 1 diabetic patients. The mechanism of increased IAB induction associated with INH is unknown and was unexpected since there was no such indication from animal studies. Upon CHMP's request, further analyses assessing the clinical significance of IABs were performed. There  was  no  apparent  association  between  INH-associated  IABs  and  adverse  clinical  outcome (especially glycemic control, hypoglycaemia  rate, pulmonary  function, other adverse events). Nevertheless, the development of high titres of IABs is still a (at least theoretical) concern. Very rare cases  of  antibody-related  insulin  resistance,  delayed,  prolonged  or  recurrent  hypoglycemia  or  other adverse  events  would  be  unlikely  to  be  detected  during  clinical  trials.  Therefore,  a  well-designed pharmacovigilance  programme  is  important.  The  Applicant  committed  to  a  proactive  approach, offering validated measurements of IABs for spontaneous reports of suspected immunologic insulin resistance or repeated unexplained hypoglycaemia using validated assays (see RMP). An additional concern regarding the development of IABs is the correlation that has been suggested, albeit  in  a  small  number  of  patients,  between  IAB  concentrations  measured  during  pregnancy  and foetal morbidity, especially an increased risk for neonatal hypoglycaemia. The CHMP agreed that an appropriate warning in section 4.6 of the SPC is sufficient and that a contraindication would be a too severe measure for a theoretical concern. The SPC recommends that when an Exubera treated patient becomes pregnant, appropriate subcutaneous insulin should be substituted for Exubera. Recent publications (Kent et al., Nakayama et al., Nature May 2005) suggest that (pro) insulin may play a key role as primary auto-antigen in the development of autoimmune diabetes. Therefore, the question was raised as to whether the marked immunogenic response to Exubera may accelerate β -cell destruction in patients with remaining insulin production. However, non-clinical and clinical studies suggest  that  oral  or  intranasal  insulin  does  not  accelerate  loss  of β -cell  function  but  may,  to  the contrary,  induce  immune  changes  consistent  with  mucosal  tolerance  to  insulin.  In  response  to  the theoretical CHMP concern, the Applicant has proposed to study the effect of inhaled insulin on β -cell function in NOD mice, an appropriate animal model of type 1 diabetes. This approach, which is part of the RMP, is generally endorsed (see RMP). Presently, no validated assay exists to measure insulin specific IgG subclass antibodies. The Applicant has committed to only use fully validated assays for IAB measurements in ongoing or future clinical trials.  The  Applicant  has  specified  the  time  frame when the validation of the immunoglobulin class assay and results of the sample analysis will be available, which was agreed upon. Safety in special populations

<!-- image -->

The general pattern of AEs observed in paediatric type 1 diabetic patients appears similar to that in adult type 1 diabetic patients. There were no gender differences that appeared to be genuine to INH. In addition, the data do not indicate an undue risk for INH-treatment of elderly patients. However, the number of patients ≥ 75 years of age included in the clinical trials was small. The latter information has been included in the SPC.

The applicant presented data (subpopulation analysis on pooled data) showing that the use of INH in patients  with  mild,  well-controlled  asthma  or  COPD  or  during  respiratory  tract  infections  was  not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

associated with increased risk for hypoglycaemia or impaired glycaemic control. The Applicant has later  provided  preliminary  data  from  studies  1028  and  1030  investigating  safety  and  efficacy  of Exubera in patients with mild to moderate asthma and COPD, respectively. These data did not reveal a major safety concern but showed that the rate of non-severe pulmonary exacerbations was increased compared to comparator group. Therefore, it was concluded that Exubera should not be recommended in  patients  with  underlying  lung  disease  such  as  asthma  or  COPD.  A  respective  warning  has  been introduced into the SPC/PL. In addition, it was found necessary to contraindicate the use of Exubera in patients with poorly controlled, unstable or severe asthma and in severe COPD since the risk of both unreliable absorption of inhaled insulin and subsequent hypoglycaemia and/or poor glycaemic control and adverse effects of inhaled insulin on asthma/COPD exacerbations appears high.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In  obese  patients,  dyspnoea  was  increased  with  INH  use  compared  to  comparator  treatment.  The applicant explained that the association 'increasing INH dose - increasing incidence of dyspnoea in patients with type 2 diabetes is explained by a common underlying mechanism , i.e. overweight/obesity; this is particularly supported by the fact that this association was not observed in non-obese  patients  with  type  1  diabetes  (BMI ≤ 30  was  inclusion  criterion  in  clinical  trials).  In addition,  results  from  the  newly  submitted  studies  A217-1022  (non-obese  type  1  diabetic  patients), 1027 (non-obese type 1 diabetic patients), and 1029 (type 2 diabetic patients with an BMI up to 35) prospectively  incorporated  the  Mahler  dyspnoea  index;  such  results  did  not  indicate  relevant  group mean changes in dyspnoea between INH and comparator-treated patients. · Discontinuation due to adverse events Overall, only few INH users discontinued for reasons related to study drug. In patients with type 1 DM, overall discontinuation rate was similar in both treatment groups, but more INH than SC insulin subjects discontinued for reasons related to study drug. Cough was the respiratory AE most commonly associated with permanent discontinuation of INH. In  all  treatment  groups,  females  were  more  likely  to  discontinue  than  males.  Elderly  patients  were more likely to discontinue INH or OA but not SC insulin than younger patients. · Post marketing experience N/A · Discussion on clinical safety The Exubera associated mean 30 to 40 ml excess decline in FEV1 initially observed in 3 to 6 months studies was considered a serious safety signal. Nevertheless, the later submitted analyses of the change from baseline over 2 years showed that the initially accelerated decline does not progress beyond the first 3-6 months of treatment in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which was considered reassuring.  Full  reassurance  will  require  a  longer  controlled  follow-up  as  proposed  in  the  risk management plan with the extension of studies 1022 and 1029. Meanwhile, monitoring of pulmonary function should be performed in patients treated with INH and stopping rules should be implemented, as described in the product information. It could not be excluded that there might be a subgroup of patients who could be more sensitive to the effects of inhaled insulin on pulmonary function. Nevertheless, this subgroups is not obvious and there are no clear predictive factors.

The applicant  has  committed  to  extend  the  controlled  clinical  studies  1022  and  1029  to  investigate pulmonary  safety  of  Exubera  after  long-term  use  (5  years  continuous  and  7  years  cumulative treatment) and to perform a large observational trial to further study the safety of Exubera under 'real world' conditions (including adequate representation of very elderly patients). The applicant has to ensure  that  this  study  will  collect  longitudinal  pulmonary  function  data  at  approximately  yearly intervals.  A  bronchoalveolar  lavage  study  is  expected  to  provide  further  information  on  the mechanism of the observed decline in pulmonary function associated with the use of inhaled insulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analyses of FEV1 decline in patients with atopic disease and in different ethnic groups will also be performed post-marketing.

Exubera should not be used in patients with underlying lung disease such as asthma or COPD because there  are  insufficient  data  to  support  the  safe  use  in  such  patients.  In  addition,  Exubera  should  be contraindicated in patients with severe, poorly controlled or unstable asthma or COPD since there are no  data  and  will  not  be  generated  and  the  risk  of  both  poor  glycemic  control  and  hypoglycemia appears high in such patients.

The  applicant  has provided  documents  that  set  out  a detailed description of the  system  of pharmacovigilance. A statement signed by the applicant and the qualified person for pharmacovigilance, indicating that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance  and  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse  reaction  occurring either in the Community or in a third country has been provided.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Concern  was  expressed  that  diabetic  patients  who  develop  heart  failure  and  subsequent  pulmonary edema while being treated with inhaled insulin may experience deterioration of glycemic control due to  impaired  insulin  absorption  from  the  lung.  As  a  consequence,  the  SPC  should  state  that  patient developing  dyspnoea  with  Exubera  should  be  examined  for  pulmonary  or  cardiac  causes;  where pulmonary edema is present, or there is clinically relevant reduction in pulmonary function, Exubera should be discontinued and the patient switched to subcutaneous insulin. As part of the risk management plan, it was also agreed to obtain further data on cardiovascular risk as well as possible correlation with decline in FEV1. Due to the observed increase in insulin antibody rate and titre associated with the use of Exubera, the applicant will measure insulin antibodies in case of unusually prolonged or recurrent hypoglycaemia or unexplained lack or loss of efficacy raising the possibility of immunologic insulin resistance. The risk for occurrence of neoplasias of the respiratory system under long-term treatment with INH needs to be assessed although the Applicant has argued convincingly that the potential cancer risk is low and hypothetical. The arguments are based on the following data:  1) INH has very low IGF-1R affinity  (approximately  5,000  times  less  than  IGF-1);  2)  nonclinical  studies  of  inhaled  INH  do  not show inflammatory, proliferative, or degenerative effects in the respiratory tract of rats and monkeys; 3) there is no safety signal on lung cancer risk in the INH clinical program;  4) IGF-1 is not associated with  increased  risk  of  lung  cancer  in  a  recent  meta-regression  analysis;    5)  epidemiologic  studies suggest  that  diabetes  mellitus  is  not  associated  with  increased  risk  of  lung  cancer;    6)  there  is  no epidemiologic evidence that insulin use is associated with increased risk for lung cancer and there are no  reports  of  neoplastic  transformation  in  the  skin  despite  very  high  local  concentrations  after  SC injections. CHMP  agreed  that  the  risk  of  tumour  promoting  effects  of  Exubera  within  the  lung  are  merely hypothetical at this point. However, it cannot be excluded that INH may accelerate the growth of preexisting  undiagnosed  precancerous  pulmonary  lesions  and  such  an  effect  could  become  clinically apparent after a few years of INH-treatment. The applicant also agreed to perform an epidemiologic study to assess the hypothetical risk of lung cancer associated with inhaled insulin. The use of the Health Improvement Network (THIN) database in the UK appears appropriate for this purpose. See also section 3.6 Risk management plan. Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

## Risk Management Plan

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As part of the Application for Marketing Authorisation the MAH has provided a Risk Management Plan, comprising a Safety Specification and a Pharmacovigilance Plan. In addition, the RMP describes activities to minimize risks.

## Safety Specification

In  order  to  specify  safety  issues,  data  from  the  preclinical  and  clinical  development  program  were considered.  With  regard  to  the  data  from  clinical  studies  the  following  issues  were  considered: limitations  of  the  human  database;  populations  not  studied  in  the  pre-approval  phase;  adverse events/adverse drug reactions; identified and potential interactions, including food-drug and drug-drug interactions; Epidemiology, Pharmacological Class Effects.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Analysis  of  this  data  allowed  identifying  real  and  potential  important  risks  as  well  as  patient populations of which data are lacking: Important identified risks · Change in pulmonary function · Smoking in relation to alterations in pharmacokinetics Important potential risks · Dose inequivalence: 1 mg and 3 mg · Increased insulin antibody levels · Asthma and COPD · Rare pulmonary events · Lung cancer (hypothetical) Important missing information · Very elderly subjects ( ≥ 75 yrs) · Congestive heart failure · Pregnancy · Children and Adolescents The  above  listed  issues  have  been  considered  suitable  for  specific  considerations  within  the pharmacovigilance plan. Pharmacovigilance Plan/Risk minimising activities Within the pharmacovigilance plan routine tools of pharmacovigilance (PSURs, ADR reporting, signal detection  tools,  etc.)  are  mentioned  which  will  be  used  to  monitor  the  postmarketing  safety  of Exubera. In addition, non-routine measures have been described intended to cover risks as outlined within the safety specification. Information is given on: the objective of proposed actions, the rationale for  proposed  actions,  monitoring  safety  of  proposed  actions,  and  milestones  for  evaluation  and reporting. The proposed actions comprise the labelling of Exubera-related material (SPC, PL, package, blisters) and measures to teach patients and health care professionnals about the proper use of Exubera; and measures  (i.e. preclinical,  clinical,  epidemiological  studies)  to  assess  gathered  information  on potential/hypothetical risks and areas of missing information. An  overview  on  relevant  clinical  trials  including  information  on  time-lines  is  given  in  the  below mentioned table.

- o Step 3: Identify  means of prevention and update of communication/education plans

Medicinal product no longer authorised Risk minimisation plan Activities to minimise risks have been specified as follow: In its evaluation of the RMP the Applicant describes that: · the RMP and its components will be evaluated and modified on an ongoing basis by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which meets at monthly intervals The RMC will pursue a staged approach o step 1: safety signal detection and evaluation (routine pharmacovigilance) o step 2: additional analyses (use of ongoing studies) and design of new studies (e.g. Large Simple Trial, THIN-database)

The  Risk  Management  Plan  is  considered  adequate  nevertheless  it  should  be  considered  'living' document, and amendments due to future safety signals are expected.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Quality

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The information provided in the application showed a consistent batch-tobatch  production  of  Exubera  achieving  an  adequate  quality  for  the  drug  substance  and  the  drug product. The manufacturing processes for the drug substance and the drug product were described and validated  in  sufficient  detail.  The  quality  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  is  controlled  by adequate test  methods  and  specifications.  No  excipients  of  human  or  animal  origin  are  used  in  the product manufacture and therefore there is no risk of contamination with viral or TSE agents by these ingredients.  No  animal  ingredients  are  used  for  the  cell  culture  process,  the  basic  down  stream processing  and  purification  with  the  exception  of  porcine  trypsin  and  porcine  carboxypeptidase  B. Sufficient  virus  validation  data  were  provided  for  the  manufacturing  processes  of  both  porcine enzymes and, as well, for the manufacturing process of recombinant human insulin to consider that Exubera  is  virologically  safe.  The  applicant  will  address  a  number  of  quality  points  as  follow-up measures postopinion. Concerning the lack of dosage form equivalence between the 1 mg and 3 mg blister reference is made to the clinical discussion.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  showed  that  insulin  inhalation  powder  was  absorbed  into  the bloodstream in a dose-dependent manner and produced the expected pharmacodynamic response of decreasing glucose concentrations. Based  on  non-clinical  data,  it  is  unlikely  that  chronic  administration  of  Exubera  will  result  in accumulation in the lung or may promote pre-existing preneoplastic/neoplastic changes in the lung. The  potential  hazard  for  the  foetus  of  frequent,  induced  insulin  antibodies  is  unknown,  therefore Exubera should not be used during pregnancy. Efficacy In clinical trials in type 1 diabetes, patients using a regimen of EXUBERA and long- or intermediateacting  insulin  had  similar  reductions  in  HbA1c compared with patients taking subcutaneous insulin alone. In clinical trials in type 2 diabetes patients using a regimen of EXUBERA and long- or intermediateacting  insulin,  had  similar  changes  in  HbA1c  compared  with  patients  treated  with  subcutaneous insulin alone. In clinical trials in type 2 diabetes patients  not sufficiently controlled with oral anti-diabetic agents alone,  using  a  regimen  of  EXUBERA  alone  or  in  combination  with  oral  agents,  had  greater improvements in HbA1c compared with patients treated with oral agents alone. In patients with type 2 diabetes sufficiently controlled with oral agents, the glycaemic control was not further improved by inhaled insulin. Safety

The most common  adverse reactions were hypoglycaemia and cough. The submitted data demonstrated that  INH  use  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  hypoglycaemia  risk  in  patients  with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cough was predominantly mild in severity and decreased over time.

The excess of decline in FEV1 is small, does not appear to increase over time and is expected to be reversible.

Exubera should not be used in patients with underlying lung disease such as asthma or COPD because there are insufficient data to support  the  safe  use  in such  patients.  In  addition,  Exubera  is contraindicated in patients with severe, poorly controlled or unstable asthma or COPD since there are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no data (and no data will be generated) and the risk of both poor glycemic control and hypoglycemia appears  high  in  such  patients.  Smoking/and  use  in  smokers  are  contraindicated  because  smoking greatly  increases  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  of  inhaled  human  insulin  and  therefore  could increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Other safety concerns include increased frequency and levels of insulin antibodies and potential long term pulmonary or cardiovascular risk.

Medicinal product no longer authorised All  safety  concerns,  identified,  potential  or  hypothetical,  have  been  addressed  in  the  product information  and  will  be  part  of  the  educational  material.  The  RMP  was  found  comprehensive  and acceptable. The lack of dose equivalence between the two proposed blister strengths is addressed by a clear and strong warning in the product information and in the educational material. In addition, the Applicant has  committed  to  improving  the  blister  design  (colour  differentiation  and  tactile  markings  on  the protruding end of the blisters) to clearly distinguish the two blister strengths. Risk Management Plan The  company  will  perform  a  number  of  studies  to  further  assess  the  safety  profile  of  the  target population and specific populations potentially at increased risk for adverse effects related to the use of Exubera (e.g. patients with asthma or COPD), set-up an enhanced pharmacovigilance system and ensure the following risk minimisation activites; -educational material, -improvement of blister design for improved differentiation of 1 and 3 mg blister strengths. -differentiation of 1 and 3mg blister strengths. Benefit/risk assessment Controlled  clinical  trials  in  type  1  or  type  2  diabetes  have  shown  that  EXUBERA  achieves  and maintains  effective  glycaemic  control  comparable  to  subcutaneously  administered  soluble  human insulin.  Safety  concerns  have  been  identified  in  terms  of  pulmonary  function  and  smoking-induced alterations in pharmacokinetics. Other risks were potential risks, in particular in relation to the dose inequivalence of the two strengths (e.g. risk of hypoglycaemia), increased insulin antibody levels and rare pulmonary events. Information is insufficient or missing in some special populations (e.g. patients with asthma, COPD or heart failure). The CHMP took into consideration the fact that type 1 diabetes patients are expected to be treated younger when starting treatment and will be treated for a longer period of time. Therefore they may be more at risk of some adverse events (e.g. hypoglycemia due to large titration steps). The CHMP considered the benefit risk balance of Exubera positive provided that a risk management plan is appropriately performed, in the following indication: 'Exubera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not adequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy. Exubera is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Type I diabetes mellitus, in addition to long or intermediate acting subcutaneous insulin, for whom the potential benefits of adding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns.'

A minority of the CHMP members did not agree with the approval of Exubera for treatment of type I diabetes, because of long-term safety concerns, including immunogenicity, limited dosing flexibility and the risk for variable/altered absorption in special situations. They were of the view that the use of inhaled insulin should be restricted to the treatment of type II diabetes which population is generally less  sensitive  to  variations  in  dose,  generally  older  and  can  be  expected  to  be  more  compliant  to treatment recommendations and the risk management plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority that the benefit/risk ratio of Exubera in the treatment of above-mentioned indication was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
