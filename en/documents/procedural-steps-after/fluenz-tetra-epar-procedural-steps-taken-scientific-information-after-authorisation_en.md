The variation also includes recommendations from the renewal procedure (EMEA/H/C/002617/0079/R) to update sections 4.4 and 4.9 in relation to traceability and overdose, respectively, and to remove of the black triangle. In addition, the product information is updated based on the recommendations included in the Guideline on quality aspects included in the product information for vaccines for human use (EMA/CHMP/BWP/133540/2017). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

Limited available evidence suggests that the trivalent Fluenz is not excreted in breastmilk. |
