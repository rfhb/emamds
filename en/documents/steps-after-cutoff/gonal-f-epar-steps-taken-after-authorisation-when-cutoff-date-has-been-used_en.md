## PROCEDURAL STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

For procedures finalised after 1 July 2004 please refer to module 8B.

At  the  time  the  initial  positive  opinion  was  granted,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the  scientific knowledge  for  products  made  using  biotechnology  is  not  static  due  to  the  rapidly  evolving methodology  in  this  field  of  science.  Therefore  new  information  will  usually  be  generated  on  an ongoing basis after Marketing Authorisation is granted. The CPMP should be kept informed about any new data. The company fulfilled its commitment to submit to the EMEA before 31 October 1995 the final report of the in vitro fertilisation study performed in the United States of America. The CPMP considered the results to be satisfactory confirming the safety and efficacy of Gonal-F.

Although  the  pharmaceutical/biotechnological  quality  of  the  Gonal-F  dossier  has  been  proven sufficient  to  support  marketing  at  this  stage,  there  were  a  number  of  open  points  concerning biopharmaceutical  characteristics  and  validation  of  some  of  the  new  methodologies  used  in  the production  process  of  Gonal-F.  To  this  end  also  new  testing  methods  should  be  developed.  The company  has  agreed  with  the  CPMP  to  provide  within  6  to  12  months,  depending  on  the  case, appropriate  information  on  the  quality  points  identified  during  the  Assessment  (See  chapter  III.2). These follow-up measures have been addressed with submissions on 30 April 1996, 17 October 1996, 6 June 1997, 9 January 1998 and 31 March 2001.

Following  the  positive  opinion  on  the  new  indication:  anovulation  (including  polycystic  ovarian disease)  in  women  who  have  been  unresponsive  to  treatment  with  clomiphene  citrate,  the  CPMP requested the company to submit the results of additional ongoing clinical studies relating to the new indication . The additional results were submitted on 13 March 1998 and were found satisfactory.

## Extensions / Major Variations

## - New strength: Gonal-F 37.5 IU

On 25 February 1999, the CPMP issued a positive opinion for the new strength Gonal-F 37.5 IU. The procedure  started  on  29  May  1998.  Although  the  SPC  recommended  a  37.5  IU  dose  titration  for anovulatory  indications,  such  strength  was  not  available.  Inclusion  of  the  37.5  IU  strength  will eliminate wastage, will facilitate adjustment of the treatment, and will minimise the chance of dosage mistakes as a result of the use of a fraction of previous dosage strengths. The Commission Decision for this extension was issued on 18 June 1999.

## - New strength: Gonal-F 600 IU/ml (multidose presentation)

On 21 September 2000, the CPMP issued a positive opinion for the addition of a new strength GonalF  600  IU/ml.  The  procedure  started  on  17  December  1999.  This  new  strength  is  a  multidose presentation of Gonal-F and provides  improved convenience for patients who are self-dosing at home. It  also  simplifies  treatment  tailoring,  allowing  dose  titration  by  adapting  the  volume  to  be  injected. This multidose vial containing preservative is not to be shared amongst patients; therefore it should be used  by  one  patient  only  (as  stated  in  the  SPC).  The  Commission  Decision  for  this  extension  was issued on 29 January 2001.

## - Addition of new monodose presentations with the solvent presented in pre-filled syringes

On  13  December  2001,  the  CPMP  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  the  addition  of  new  monodose presentations  with  the  solvent  presented  in  prefilled  syringes.  The  new  presentations  of  the  solvent consist  of  1.1  ml  sterilised  water  for  injections  (Ph.Eur.)  in  pre-filled  syringes  (Type  I  Ph.Eur. colourless  glass).  Pack  sizes  are:  1,  5,  and  10  pre-filled  syringes.  Except  for  a  limited  number  of points, which  can be addressed as part of post-authorisation  commitments, the quality  of these  new presentation is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

presentations have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Viral safety and batchto-batch  consistency  has been  documented and the relevant test  will be performed  according to the agreed specifications. The Commission Decision for this Type II variation was issued on 7 July 2002.

## - Addition of a new pharmaceutical form

On 25 September 2003, the CPMP considered that the benefit/risk profile  of a new pharmaceutical form  for  GONAL-f    (i.e.  solution  for  injection  presented  in  a  pre-filled  pen)  was  favourable.  A positive opinion was therefore adopted on the addition of this new pharmaceutical form, a ready-touse formulation designed to facilitate the administration of the product. The Commission Decision for this extension was issued on 23 February 2004.

## - Addition for a new multidose presentation

On 25 September  2003,  the  CPMP  adopted  a  positive  opinion  for  a  Type  II  for  a  new  multidose presentation  for  GONAL-f  powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection  300  IU/0.50  ml  (22 micrograms/0.50ml). After reconstitution with 0.75 ml of solvent, its concentration is the same as for the  already  authorised  multidose  presentations  i.e.  600  IU/ml.  The  Commission  Decision  for  this variation was issued on 14 January 2004.

## Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation

For the  first  renewal  of  Gonal-F, the CPMP  was  of the  opinion that the quality, the safety  and the efficacy  of  this  medicinal  product  continued  to  be  adequately  and  sufficiently  demonstrated  and therefore  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Gonal-F  continued  to  be  favourable  for  the authorised  indications  and  issued  on  21  September  2000  a  positive  opinion  for  the  renewal  of  the Marketing Authorisation. The Commission Decision for this Renewal was issued on 29 December 2000.
